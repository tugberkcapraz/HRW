Update: On January 17, a Bishkek court ordered 11 journalists be held in pre-trial detention for two months. The 11, all currently or formerly with Temirov Live, and now Ayt Ayt Dese, Alga Media, Archa Media, and Politklinika, were detained on January 16 on the charge of ""calls to disobedience and mass riots"" (article 278.3 of the Criminal Code). The prosecution has not identified what constituted the alleged calls, or in which publications they were allegedly made.

(Berlin, January 16, 2024) – The Kyrgyz authorities should drop criminal cases of “war propaganda” and “calls to mass disorder” initiated against several independent media outlets, eight human rights groups said today in a joint statement.

The groups facing charges include 24.KG, Temirov Live, Ayt Ayt Dese, Alga Media, Archa Media, and Politklinika, all in clear retaliation for their independent reporting. In an escalation of pressure on independent media. On January 15 and 16, 2024, Kyrgyz law enforcement agents and security services carried out early morning raids targeting media outlets and reporters. The authorities should stop intimidating and harassing journalists, and allow them to carry out their work without obstruction.

The groups issuing that statement are Human Rights Watch, Civil Rights Defenders, International Partnership for Human Rights (IPHR), Norwegian Helsinki Committee, People in Need, Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights, and International Federation for Human Rights and World Organisation Against Torture within the framework of the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders.

On January 16, Kyrgyz police raided the homes of at least 10 current and former journalists with Temirov Live, Ayt Ayt Dese, Alga Media, Archa Media, and Politklinika; confiscated equipment; and detained several of them for interrogation, Kyrgyz media reported. According to 24.KG, Kyrgyz police said in a statement that the raids and detentions were part of a criminal investigation under Article 278.3 of the Criminal Code, which penalizes “calls to disobedience and mass riots.”

The Interior Ministry’s press service told local media that the agency opened the investigation after linguistic experts, commissioned by the police in late December 2023, allegedly concluded that some publications contained signs of such calls. It is unclear what publications these charges concern. The Criminal Code provision is vaguely worded and has repeatedly been used to initiate criminal charges against critics of the authorities. It provides for penalties up to eight years in prison.

On January 15, the Kyrgyz State Committee on National Security raided the newsroom in Bishkek of the independent news agency 24.KG, confiscated equipment and detained the outlet’s director Asel Otorbayeva and its two chief editors Makhinur Niyazova and Anton Lymar, holding them for nearly four hours for interrogation. The security agency also confiscated mobile phones of other 24.KG reporters, sent them home, and sealed the office, local media reported. A post on X, formerly Twitter, on January 15 from the 24.KG account said: “24.KG newsroom is being raided. GKNB agents are in the premises. [Our] Lawyers are barred entry.”

Citing the security agency’s press service, Kyrgyz media reported that the agency took actions against 24.KG in connection with a criminal case the agency had initiated. on charges of “war propaganda” under article 407 of the Kyrgyz Criminal Code. The agency said that the Pervomayski District Court in Bishkek had approved the raid. This criminal provision carries a sentence of heavy fines or imprisonment of up to seven years with a ban on carrying out professional activities for up to three years.

Before being taken for interrogation, Niyazova told journalists that the criminal case against 24.KG was related to its reporting on the war in Ukraine. Upon their release Niyazova and her colleagues told journalists that they had been required to sign a non-disclosure agreement for the duration of the criminal investigation, so were unable to share any further information.

The outlet’s lawyers reported being denied access to the 24.KG office during the raid as well as to the 24.KG representatives during their interrogation on security agency premises.

The actions against 24.KG and others come in the context of a worsening campaign against free speech in Kyrgyzstan and are likely to reinforce a climate of fear among independent media outlets, the groups issuing the joint statement said.

In the last few years, independent media and journalists, bloggers , and others critical of the Kyrgyz government’s policies have faced increasing pressure, including politically motivated criminal cases, arrests, and imprisonment. The websites of independent news sites have been arbitrarily blocked and the authorities have attempted to close down media organizations because of their independent reporting, such as in an ongoing court case against Kloop and an earlier case against the Kyrgyz service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, in which its bank account was frozen.

Previously another independent outlet, Kaktus Media, came under investigation on charges of war propaganda because of its reporting on hostilities at Kyrgyzstan’s border with Tajikistan. Bolot Temirov, a journalist at Temirov Live whose wife and colleagues were targeted by the raids on January 16, was stripped of his citizenship and deported because of his outlet’s investigations into high-level corruption.

Freedom of expression in Kyrgyzstan will further deteriorate if a repressive draft media law, which is currently under consideration in parliament, is adopted. The draft law would significantly expand government control over the media, and grant the authorities wide powers to deny media outlets registration, obstruct their work, and close them down. The draft media law has been severely criticised by the media community, human rights groups and international human rights experts. On January, 15, the parliamentary committee on international affairs postponed its consideration of the draft law, saying it needed additional revisions.

The Kyrgyz authorities need to take immediate and decisive steps to bring the country’s respect for press freedom in accordance with its international obligations, in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the groups said. They should immediately cease their repressive actions against independent media outlets and journalists, and allow them to report on events in the country and the rest of the world without fear of retribution. The authorities should also refrain from pursuing the draft media law in its current format. The Kyrgyz authorities’ respect for freedom of expression should be an important consideration by the EU and other actors seeking closer engagement with the country.",HIGH,20240118T014500Z,Kyrgyz authorities,"Asel Otorbayeva, Makhinur Niyazova, Anton Lymar, Bolot Temirov",Kyrgyz law enforcement and security services,"Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan","Cease repressive actions against media, respect international obligations on press freedom.",Criminal charges including war propaganda and calls to mass disorder against independent media outlets,Kyrgyzstan,Government retaliation against independent media reporting

(New York, January 3, 2024) – Countries that approved the first-ever United Nations General Assembly resolution on “killer robots” should promote negotiations on a new international treaty to ban and regulate these weapons, Human Rights Watch said today. Autonomous weapons systems select and apply force to targets based on sensor processing rather than human inputs.

On December 22, 2023, 152 countries voted in favor of the General Assembly resolution on the dangers of lethal autonomous weapons systems, while four voted no, and 11 abstained. General Assembly Resolution 78/241 acknowledges the “serious challenges and concerns” raised by “new technological applications in the military domain, including those related to artificial intelligence and autonomy in weapons systems.”

“The General Assembly resolution on autonomous weapons systems stresses the urgent need for the international community to deal with the dangers raised by removing human control from the use of force,” said Mary Wareham, arms advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. “The resolution’s wide support shows that governments are prepared to take action, and they should move forward on a new international treaty without delay.”

Some autonomous weapons systems have existed for years, but the types, duration of operation, geographical scope, and environment in which such systems operate have been limited. However, technological advances are spurring the development of autonomous weapons systems that operate without meaningful human control, delegating life-and-death decisions to machines. The machine rather than the human operator would determine where, when, or against what force is applied.

The resolution asks UN Secretary-General António Guterres to seek the views of countries and other stakeholders on ways to address the challenges and concerns raised by autonomous weapons systems “from humanitarian, legal, security, technological and ethical perspectives,” and reflect those views in a report to the General Assembly by September 2024.

The resolution adds an agenda item on “lethal autonomous weapons systems” to the provisional agenda of the UN General Assembly in 2024, providing a platform for states to pursue action to address this issue. The General Assembly provides an inclusive and accessible forum in which any UN member state can contribute. Tackling the killer robots challenge under its auspices would allow greater consideration of concerns that have been overlooked in discussions held to date, including ethical perspectives, international human rights law, proliferation, and impacts on global security and regional and international stability, including the risk of an arms race and lowering the threshold for conflict, Human Rights Watch said.

The countries voting against the resolution were: Belarus, India, Mali, and Russia. Those abstaining were: China, Iran, Israel, Madagascar, North Korea, Niger, Saudi Arabia, South Sudan, Syria, Türkiye, and the United Arab Emirates. Of these states, China, India, Iran, Israel, and Türkiye have been investing heavily in military applications of artificial intelligence and related technologies to develop air, land, and sea-based autonomous weapons systems.

Austria put forward the resolution with 42 co-sponsoring states at the UN General Assembly’s First Committee on Disarmament and International Security, where it passed an initial vote on November 1, by 164 votes in favor, five against, and eight abstentions.

More than 100 countries regard a new treaty on autonomous weapons systems with prohibitions and restrictions as necessary, urgent, and achievable, and during 2023, many states and international organizations have reiterated their support for this objective.

In February, more than 30 countries from Latin America and the Caribbean endorsed the Belén Communiqué, acknowledging the need “to promote the urgent negotiation of an international legally binding instrument, with prohibitions and regulations with regard to autonomy in weapons systems.” In September, 15 Caribbean states endorsed a CARICOM declaration on the human impacts of autonomous weapons at a meeting in Trinidad and Tobago.

On October 5, Secretary-General Guterres and International Committee of the Red Cross President Mirjana Spoljaric issued a joint appeal for UN member states to negotiate a new international treaty by 2026 to ban and regulate autonomous weapons systems.

Most treaty proponents have called for prohibitions on autonomous systems that by their nature operate without meaningful human control or that target people, as well as regulations that ensure all other autonomous weapons systems cannot be used without meaningful human control.

Talks on lethal autonomous weapons systems have been held at the Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW) in Geneva since May 2014, but have failed to deliver a substantive outcome. The main reason for the lack of progress under the CCW is that its member countries rely on a consensus approach to decision-making, which means a single country can reject a proposal, even if every other country agrees to it. A handful of major military powers have exploited this to repeatedly block proposals to negotiate a legally binding instrument.

On November 17, states at the CCW agreed to meet for up to 20 days across 2024 and 2025 to “consider and formulate, by consensus, a set of elements of an instrument, without prejudging its nature.” The agreement does not mandate states to negotiate and adopt a new CCW protocol.

“Technological change is rapidly advancing a future of automated killing that needs to be stopped,” Wareham said. “To safeguard humanity, all governments should support the urgent negotiation of a new international treaty to prohibit and restrict autonomous weapons systems.”

(Jerusalem) – Israeli authorities held thousands of workers from Gaza in incommunicado detention for several weeks following the October 7 attacks, subjecting at least some of them to inhumane and degrading conditions, Human Rights Watch said. Thousands more remain stranded in the occupied West Bank without valid legal status and vulnerable to arrest.

Those detained after October 7 were held by Israeli authorities in Israel and the West Bank, some of whom were reportedly interrogated on alleged links to, or knowledge of, the attacks. On November 3, over 3,000 Palestinian workers were released from detention and transferred to Gaza. Israeli authorities have yet to state the total numbers of workers from Gaza in Israel on October 7, or the number of workers who were detained or remain detained. Israeli authorities have not disclosed if any workers from Gaza were charged with any crime.

“Israeli authorities detained thousands of workers for weeks without charge in incommunicado detention, subjecting at least some to humiliating ill-treatment,” said Michelle Randhawa, senior refugee and migrant rights officer at Human Rights Watch. “The search for perpetrators and abettors of the October 7 attacks does not justify abusing workers who had been granted permits to work in Israel.”

The October 7 Hamas-led attacks killed an estimated 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli authorities. More than 21,600 Palestinians have been killed, including more than 8,500 children, during the hostilities, according to Gaza authorities.

An estimated 18,500 workers from Gaza had permits to work in Israel on October 7, though it is unclear how many were in Israel that day. To get permits, applicants from Gaza underwent stringent security evaluations.

On December 19 and 21, Human Rights Watch wrote to the Israeli military and Israel Prison Service with its findings asking for comment, but received no response, as of writing.

Human Rights Watch spoke to four workers from Gaza detained by Israeli authorities after October 7. Three workers were part of a small group released to the West Bank before November 3, and one was released on November 3 to Gaza.

One man attempted to go to the West Bank after he realized his work permit was cancelled and deleted from Al Munasiq, the phone app where work permits are stored. He said he was stopped at a checkpoint on the way to the West Bank, blindfolded, hands tightly bound with zip ties, and taken first to Ofer prison, and then to an unknown second location. There, he said, “They [forced me to take] off all my clothes…and they took pictures of me.…They beat me intensely, I was naked during this, it was humiliating. The worst part was when the dogs were attacking [me]. I was blindfolded and cuffed with metal shackles, I didn’t know if the dogs were controlled by someone or just left to attack me, I was terrified.”

He was interrogated and asked to identify his home on an aerial map of Gaza and was also asked about specific people. He was then released on November 3 at the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza.

Another man said Israeli police in Rahat, a city in southern Israel, arrested him and other workers from Gaza after the October 7 attacks and took them to an army base in Ofakim, Israel.

[The Israeli forces] “made us undress,” he said. “[We were] completely naked. They handed us Pampers to wear and thin white overalls…. We stayed blindfolded and cuffed [with zip ties on our hands and feet] for 10 days... We kept asking why we are detained. We never got an answer, only verbal assaults and death threats.”

He said he was beaten for hours, then dragged on gravel face down and attached to a wall or fence by his cuffed hands, and then beaten again: “Every time I fell on the ground I was forced to stand up, and again more beatings and I fell on the ground. With every beating and fall the plastic zip ties on my hands became tighter and more painful.”

He was then transferred to Ofer prison where he spent another four or five days until he was released into the West Bank.

Another man who worked in Rahat said he and other workers were arrested and taken to the Rahat police station on or around October 9. While blindfolded with their hands zip-tied behind their backs, “Israeli forces constantly cursed at us…and threatened to kill us.... We were held for 12 hours. We were not allowed water or [to use] the bathroom.”

Israeli forces also transferred him to Ofer prison, where he said he was interrogated about Hamas in Gaza. On October 22, Israeli authorities released him to Palestinian Red Crescent paramedics, who took him by ambulance to the Ramallah Public Hospital, where staff treated his zip tie wounds. Human Rights Watch saw the scars on his wrists.

The Israeli military spokesperson confirmed to Haaretz two Gaza workers, one with cancer, one with diabetes, died in Israeli custody, saying, “The two died due to […]complex medical condition[s] contracted before they arrived at the facilities. An investigation is being conducted into the circumstances of their death.” Both men were arrested after October 7. One of the men Human Rights Watch interviewed said there was a cancer patient with him in Ofer who died after a few days in pain.

The Israeli human rights groups Gisha and HaMoked told Human Rights Watch that families in Gaza contacted them after October 7 when they stopped hearing from relatives with work permits in Israel. Both organizations requested permission to visit the detainees, speak to them by phone, and receive information on their judicial status, yet to no avail.

“We had no contact with the Gaza workers while they were detained,” said Nadya Daqqah, a lawyer from HaMoked. “It can’t get any more incommunicado than this.”

On October 23, six human rights organizations in Israel filed an urgent petition with Israel’s High Court, which stated Israeli authorities had refused to provide any information about where workers were being detained, under what law, and for how long.

On November 2, Gisha and HaMoked submitted a second urgent petition to Israel’s High Court stating that “the detainees were being held…without access to legal representation” and allegedly subjected to “physical violence and psychological abuse, as well as…inhumane conditions.”

On November 2, the Israeli cabinet voted to return “Gaza workers who were in Israel on the day the war broke out” to Gaza. The next day, Israeli authorities released 3,026 Palestinian workers to Gaza via the Kerem Shalom crossing. On November 13, the Court rejected the petition, given the release of workers on November 3.

The released Palestinian workers gave media interviews, describing abuses and degrading conditions in detention, including being subjected to electric shocks, urinated on, attacked by dogs, as well as held for several days without food or water. Human Rights Watch was not able to verify these accounts. Gisha interviewed two brothers who had similar accounts of being blindfolded, beaten, and held without any communication with either their families or lawyers.

On November 9, the Israeli government published an emergency regulation on the “detention and deportation of unlawful residents of [Gaza].” The regulation states that Gaza workers no longer have a legal basis for being in Israel – since Israeli authorities canceled their work permits – and will be held in custody until removal. While the regulation sets time limits on detention, it also allows for extensions based on security needs.

The situation of the thousands of workers from Gaza who fled or were released to the West Bank remains unclear. Many are living in temporary shelters provided by the Palestinian Authority and nongovernmental organizations. There are reports from late November that Israeli Defense Forces have arrested workers from Gaza who had been sheltering in private homes.

On November 10, Israel, in coordination with the Palestinian Authority, transferred another group of 982 workers from Gaza who had been sheltering in the West Bank to Gaza via the Kerem Shalom crossing.

On November 28, Israeli authorities released 300 Palestinian workers to Gaza via the Kerem Shalom crossing. According to Osnat Cohen-Lifshitz, the head of Gisha’s legal department, these workers were released from the Anatot military base.

“Israeli authorities should disclose how many workers from Gaza were in Israel on October 7, how many were detained, whether any remain in detention and the basis for their detention,” Randhawa said. “They should investigate reports of abuse in detention and ensure the humane treatment of all detainees.”",HIGH,20240103T061500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Michelle Randhawa, senior refugee and migrant rights officer at Human Rights Watch",Israeli authorities,"Kerem Shalom crossing, Ofer prison, various locations in Israel and West Bank","Disclosure of detainee numbers and conditions, investigation into abuses, humane treatment of detainees.",Inhuman and degrading treatment of detained Palestinian workers,Israel,Alleged links to the October 7 Hamas-led attacks

When this newsletter looked at Haiti’s living nightmare in September, we noted international security support may be necessary to help stem the horrific breakdown of public order. We did not say this lightly – past interventions left a trail of abuses – but the situation was so bad, the world needed to re-examine its well-warranted reluctance to get involved.

The situation in Haiti has only deteriorated since.

For years, the people of Haiti have suffered a severe political, humanitarian, and security crisis, and things got even worse with the assassination of the country’s president in 2021.

There’s been a surge in killings and kidnappings, rampant sexual violence, and a severe food crisis. Criminal groups prevent the delivery of humanitarian assistance to people in dire need of food, medicine, and other aid.

In October 2023, the UN Security Council authorized the deployment to Haiti of a Multinational Security Support mission, to be led by Kenya. However, the mission’s deployment has been stalled.

Another complication has now arisen with a ruling by Kenya’s High Court on Friday that blocks the government from deploying police officers to Haiti. The government is appealing.

With extreme violence and the collapse of public order engulfing them, Haitians are wondering how long they’ll have to wait.

The UN Security Council discussed Haiti again last week, and HRW’s executive director Tirana Hassan addressed the body. After reminding Council members of the desperate plight people are facing in Haiti, she explained the need for the international mission to be driven by a human-rights-based approach – and she detailed what that would look like.

Of course, given the deadly mistakes of past interventions in Haiti, the deployment will need diligent oversight. The Council should also support investigations into any allegations of abuse and ensure accountability of anyone found guilty.

And although ending the country’s violent chaos may be the most immediate concern, any lasting peace and security will need to do more than that. People need well-coordinated humanitarian and development assistance and a transitional government that can credibly work with international partners to ensure the rule of law until free and fair elections can be organized.

For too long the victims of criminal groups and their backers, the people of Haiti deserve to see strong measures put in place to ensure justice and accountability for past crimes.

And, of course, the international intervention needs to curb the illicit flow of arms and ammunition to criminal groups in Haiti.

Haitians are facing terrifying levels of violence – unprecedented even for a country with as troubled a recent history as Haiti.

As Tirana says: “Each day that passes without a meaningful increase in international support that addresses all aspects of the crisis puts more lives at risk.”",VERY HIGH,20240129T170000Z,Human Rights Watch,Tirana Hassan (HRW's executive director),International Community / Criminal Groups,Haiti,Ensure a human-rights-based approach to intervention; support investigations into abuses; provide humanitarian and development assistance.,"Severe political, humanitarian, and security crisis marked by violence and abuse",Haiti,"Political instability, economic crisis, resurgence of criminal groups, historical context of past interventions"

The banner reads: ‘Bring Him Back!’ © 2024 Cornelia Suhan

A year ago Germany deported to Tajikistan an activist from that country’s exiled opposition movement who had been living in Dortmund since 2009. What happened next is a shocking example of what can occur when Germany fails to uphold safeguards in its increased efforts to deport unsuccessful asylum seekers. The Bundestag this month gave police greater powers to carry out deportations.

The activist, Abdullohi Shamsiddin, 33, was deported to Tajikistan on January 18 2023. He was detained on arrival by the security services. Two months later he was convicted of trying to overthrow the constitution and jailed for seven years. No credible evidence was presented in an unfair trial.

Tajikistan, a predominantly Musim country of 9.7m people in Central Asia is ruled by one the world’s longest serving autocrats. President Emomali Rahmon has been in power since 1992. He has led a severe crackdown on human rights, especially since 2015, when the main opposition party, the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan (IRPT) and Group 24, another opposition group, were banned. The European Parliament this month expressed concern over “state repression against independent media” in the country.

Since 2021 the government has brutally suppressed protests in the region of Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast, leading to many deaths.

The German government acknowledged the human rights crisis in Tajikistan last year in response to a parliamentary question on Shamsiddin’s case. “Basic freedoms for citizens, especially freedom of speech and freedom of religion are severely restricted in Tajikistan” it said. Members of the IRPT are regularly “jailed and given long prison terms”, the government added.

Shamsiddin’s father, a refugee in Germany, is a senior IRPT member. This made Shamsiddin’s forced return a particularly precious gift for Tajikistan’s authoritarian leaders.

After his detention Shamsiddin was held for over two months in a darkened isolation cell and has been mistreated, according to family members. He has lost weight and has been denied medical care. When a German embassy official visited him, eight prison guards were present.

Dozens of his friends and relatives in Tajikistan have been questioned based on contacts the Tajik authorities retrieved from Shamsiddin’s mobile phone, a device they obtained because German police officials gave it to them. A cousin of Shamsiddin, Saidumar Saidov was jailed last July for six years for a short social media post about Shamsiddin’s case.

Shamsiddin should never have been deported because international law, including multiple treaties to which Germany is bound, prohibits “refoulement”, returning a person to a country where they are at risk of torture or cruel or inhumane treatment.

Shamsiddin, who is married and has two small children, made three unsuccessful asylum applications in Germany. His case is complex. He changed his name after arriving in Germany and has several convictions. Apparently for these reasons local authorities and courts chose not to accept experts on Tajikistan who said it was highly likely he would be detained and mistreated if returned.

German authorities were aware of Shamsiddin’s true identity before he was deported, as officials from the Tajik embassy in Berlin had confirmed this in June 2022. Shamsiddin’s wife, a Tajik citizen, has refugee status in the European Union.

Germany’s decision to deport Shamsiddin had severe consequences as Tajikistan is infamous for pursuing its opponents abroad. Many opposition supporters moved abroad after the crackdown in 2015.

In 2016 HRW published findings pointing to Dushanbe’s strategy of assaulting or kidnapping activists living abroad or seeking their deportation. Since then, deportations to Tajikistan of opposition figures have occurred from many countries including Austria as well as Germany.

The Tajik government regularly interrogates Tajikistan-based relatives of exiled activists, to pressure those activists to halt their campaigns. Last September a group of Tajik activists protested in Berlin at the visit there of president Rahmon. In the following days authorities in Tajikistan questioned around 50 relatives of the protesters in Berlin, detaining some for several days.

Several members of the Bundestag are following Shamsiddin’s case. The German government should urge Tajikistan to end its human rights violations, to release Shamsiddin and allow him to leave the country. Tajikistan is currently seeking closer ties with Europe, so Germany has leverage in its negotiations with Dushanbe, if it is willing to use it.

Berlin should also investigate how Shamsiddin was deported to face a known risk of torture or inhuman treatment, to ensure such incidents do not happen again.

This is urgent. In November another Tajik opposition activist was deported from Germany. Bilal Qurbanaliev was one of the protesters against Rahmon last September. He is now in detention in Tajikistan. And in December a Tajik man was arrested in Germany on terrorism charges. The allegations are serious and should be investigated. But he should not be deported to Tajikistan if there is a danger he could face torture there.",VERY HIGH,20240130T134500Z,Human rights organizations,"Emomali Rahmon, Abdullohi Shamsiddin",German government,Tajikistan,"Germany should end deportations to Tajikistan, ensure human rights are protected",Deportation of opposition activist leading to torture and imprisonment,Tajikistan,"Authoritarian rule in Tajikistan, crackdown on opposition"

(New York) – Bhutan’s new government should uphold the economic and social rights of Bhutanese people, many of whom are struggling to meet their basic needs, and release all political prisoners, Human Rights Watch said in a letter released today to Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay. Tobgay was sworn in as prime minister on January 25, 2024, following his People’s Democratic Party’s victory in recent elections.

Human Rights Watch has identified at least 36 people convicted of political offenses following unfair trials that frequently relied on confessions coerced under torture. They are referred to in Bhutanese law, and by prison officials, as rajbandi (state or royal prisoners), “anti-national,” or “political prisoners.” Many have been imprisoned for decades serving sentences of life without parole and are denied contact with their families or the outside world, in violation of international standards.

“These prisoners’ cases date back to a time before Bhutan’s transition to democracy in 2008, when they received unfair trials that condemned them to spend their lives in prison,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “It is time to end a painful chapter of history, which is at odds with the values espoused by the Kingdom of Bhutan today, and return these prisoners to their families.”

The conditions in which political prisoners are held have declined drastically in recent years. Food rations have been cut, yet prisoners are obliged to sell a portion of their food to police and prison guards to buy medicine and clothes, which the authorities do not provide. Prisoners have inadequate means to stay warm, including inadequate bedding. At least four prisoners in the “anti-national” block at Chemgang Jail are believed to have serious health problems, allegedly resulting from mistreatment while in detention. Other political prisoners are held at Rabuna and elsewhere.

Prisoners in similar cases have been released by the Royal Government of Bhutan in the past. In 1999, His Majesty King Jigme Singye Wangchuck granted amnesty to 40 political prisoners, including some serving life sentences. In 2022, His Majesty King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck granted amnesty to a political prisoner serving a life term.

The Kingdom of Bhutan is known around the world for espousing enlightened values, including compassion and the pursuit of gross national happiness. The government should uphold those values, as well as international legal standards, and end the suffering of these prisoners and their families by releasing them, Human Rights Watch said.

Prime Minister Tobgay noted in his election campaign that about one in eight Bhutanese are “struggling to meet their basic needs for food” amid “unprecedented economic challenges and mass exodus” of people moving abroad and made a commitment to address these problems.

The Bhutanese government should ensure that all Bhutanese are able to access quality public services including health and education, as well as social security programs that ensure an adequate standard of living, Human Rights Watch said. Major infrastructure projects, such as the proposed new “mindfulness city” at Gelephu, should be caried out in a manner that upholds the rights of local people.

“Bhutan has sought to cultivate its global image by espousing ‘gross national happiness’ and articulating ideals such as compassion,” Pearson said. “We hope that Prime Minister Tobgay’s government will put those principles into practice by releasing political prisoners and pursuing economic policies that advance the welfare of all Bhutanese.”

Congratulations on becoming prime minister. As you once again assume government leadership, I am writing on behalf of Human Rights Watch to draw your attention to some of the urgent human rights challenges facing Bhutan.

Human Rights Watch is an independent non-governmental organization that works in over 90 countries around the world, including the United States, India, and China. We have worked on human rights in Bhutan for several decades.

You noted in your election campaign that around one in eight Bhutanese are “struggling to meet their basic needs for food” amid “unprecedented economic challenges and mass exodus” of people moving abroad.[1] We welcome your commitment to address these problems. We urge you to ensure that all Bhutanese are able to access quality public services including health and education, and social security programs that ensure an adequate standard of living. We also urge you to ensure that major infrastructure projects, such as the proposed new “mindfulness city” at Gelephu, are implemented in a manner that upholds the rights of local people.[2]

We also wish to draw your attention to continuing violations of international law against so-called “anti-national,” “rajbandi” or “political” prisoners who are serving long sentences in Bhutanese jails. We urge your government to release these prisoners, ending a painful chapter of history which is at odds with the values espoused by the Kingdom of Bhutan.

Our research has identified at least 36 people convicted of political offenses following unfair trials that frequently relied on confessions coerced under torture.[3] Many are serving sentences of life without parole, and they are denied contact with their families or the outside world, in violation of international standards.

The conditions in which these prisoners are held have declined drastically in recent years. Food rations have been cut, yet prisoners are obliged to sell a portion of their food to police and prison guards in order to buy medicine and clothes, which the authorities do not provide. We understand that prisoners have inadequate means to stay warm, including inadequate bedding. At least four prisoners in the “anti-national” block at Chemgang Jail are believed to have serious health problems, allegedly resulting from mistreatment while in detention. Other “political” prisoners are held at Rabuna and elsewhere.

Prisoners in similar cases have been released by the Royal Bhutan Government in the past. In 1999, His Majesty King Jigme Singye Wangchuck granted amnesty to 40 political prisoners,[4] including some serving life sentences. In 2022, His Majesty King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck granted amnesty to a political prisoner serving a life term.[5] The Kingdom of Bhutan is known around the world for espousing enlightened values, including of compassion and the pursuit of gross national happiness. We urge your government to uphold those values, as well as international legal standards, and end the suffering of these prisoners and their families. They should be freed.

Souleymane K. (not his real name) left his home in Côte d’Ivoire alone in 2022, when he was 15. After a beating by a potential human trafficker that left deep scars, he went to Mali, where he spent six months working long hours performing domestic work. He eventually made his way to Libya, where he was arbitrarily detained in Sabratha by an unidentified group and was regularly beaten by guards. After three months, he was let go after paying a bribe and managed to board a Zodiac, a large inflatable boat, with over one hundred people. A Navy ship rescued the group after two or three days at sea and took them to Italy.

He faced racism and other discriminatory treatment in Italy, he told Human Rights Watch, and decided to travel to France. When he reached Ventimiglia, an Italian town on the French border, he met a Guinean boy and they attempted to cross into France together by train. After two successive attempts when French police stopped them and made them return to Italy, they walked through the Alps for a full day to reach Nice, in France. “It took over a full day of walking in the mountains. It was hard, we walked, we walked, we walked so much,” he told Human Rights Watch.

Once in Nice, he slept on the street for two nights until a stranger offered to buy him a train ticket to Marseille. Upon arriving in Marseille, he slept underneath the staircase of the Marseille-Saint-Charles railway station for three nights before a volunteer from a local association found him and accompanied him to the police station so he could file a declaration that he was unaccompanied.

The child protection agency placed him in temporary emergency accommodation pending an assessment to determine whether he was under age 18, and therefore eligible for children’s services. After one month, he received a negative age assessment for reasons he still does not understand:

They put me in a hotel, where they watched me. After the evaluation, they told me I was an adult because I like to go outside during the day to play football. They said that because I don’t stay in the hotel, I am too independent to be a child. I failed my evaluation on Friday and the following Monday I was forced to leave the hotel. I slept on the street for a week until a friend put me in touch with an association helping kids like me.

Souleymane is among the thousands of unaccompanied children who leave their country and travel to France each year. Once in France, these children frequently undergo age assessments to determine whether they will be taken into care by the child protection system (Aide Sociale à l’Enfance, ASE) and receive services such as legal assistance, the appointment of a guardian, accommodation, health care, and education.

Unaccompanied migrant children in France are entitled to temporary emergency accommodation (accueil provisoire d’urgence, APU) while awaiting age assessments. Yet many experience delays of weeks or months before they receive shelter.

Age assessments typically include an observation period, a review of identity documents, and an interview. In Marseille, 50 percent are initially denied formal recognition as children. As in Souleymane’s case, these outcomes often appear to be the product of arbitrary reasons that improperly discount children’s testimony and other evidence. An immediate consequence of a negative age assessment is eviction from emergency shelter, subjecting children to life on the street, degrading treatment, and risk of violence, exploitation, and trafficking.

Appealing an adverse decision is possible, and nearly 75 percent of children in Marseille who seek review of their case before a judge ultimately succeed in having negative age assessments overturned. However, the process is time-consuming; review by the courts can take months or even years. In the interim, delays in formal recognition as children preclude children from entering the child protection system and accessing rights afforded to them, including housing, health, and education.

In Marseille, while children wait for a judge to hear their case, they often sleep outside the Marseille-Saint-Charles railway station or elsewhere on the streets until they find assistance through a network of local associations that run squats or individuals who volunteer space in their homes. Without the help of such private initiatives, these children would be homeless.

Negative age assessments and extended periods in judicial limbo take a toll on children’s physical and mental health. After long and dangerous journeys, the overwhelming majority of migrant children arrive in Marseille showing symptoms of post-traumatic stress and deterioration in their mental health, and with no access to psychosocial support. Because they are ineligible for France’s universal health care system without formal recognition as children, their health needs are not always identified and met, and medical treatment and psychosocial support may be delayed.

A healthcare worker treating unaccompanied migrant children at a free health center in Marseille said, “We see a lot of health problems related to post-trauma from the voyage these kids take to get here. Many get injured along the way but never get care, and almost all of them suffer psychological distress, manifesting in the form of headaches, difficulty sleeping, and stress.”

In addition, unaccompanied young migrants are in a state of limbo: the child protection system has decided that they are not children, but the health system does not regard them as having complete autonomy over their health decisions until they are adults. As a result, they are often refused medical authorization for surgeries and interventions.

A., a pregnant teenage girl from West Africa, was accompanied by a social worker from Le Comede, an association providing health services to asylum seekers in Marseille, to the hospital to seek an abortion. When Human Rights Watch spoke to the social worker in June 2023, A. was entering her second trimester and still had not undergone the procedure because the date of birth on her identity documents was not consistent with paperwork from the department deeming her an adult. She was nearing the time limit for legal abortion on request in France, which is the fourteenth week of pregnancy. (In this and other descriptions of medical cases, at the request of the individual or the organizations working with these children, we identify the child only by a randomly chosen initial.)

While in principle the right to education is guaranteed to all children regardless of migration status, unaccompanied migrant children in Marseille experience delays enrolling in school during the time they are seeking review of an adverse age determination. Even when their age is accepted by school authorities, most of the children we spoke with waited months to be placed in school because there were no spots available for them. In one such case, Isaac T., a 15-year-old from Côte d’Ivoire who was awaiting the outcome of judicial hearings when we spoke with him in June, told us, “Studying in France was my dream, but now I’m not sure it will ever happen… I took the school placement test so long ago, but I still don’t go to school,” explaining that he had been in France for six months and still had no school placement.

Prolonged periods of time in legal limbo also have implications for a child’s regularization of legal status upon adulthood. Under French law, children do not need a visa or residence permit (titre de séjour) to stay in French territory, whereas adults—and those who are not formally recognized as children—are subject to detention and deportation without these documents. Once they reach adulthood, children have the opportunity to receive residence permits or in some cases citizenship, depending on their age at entry into the child protection system, meaning that delays in formal recognition of minority can have ongoing consequences for legal status.

In one such case, Koffi T., a 17-year-old Ivorian boy, was formally recognized as a child on the eve of his eighteenth birthday. A volunteer from Collectif 113, an association helping unaccompanied migrant children based in Marseille, told us, “Now we must hurry to make sure he is placed in a school by next fall so that by his nineteenth birthday, he will have been in some sort of professional training for at least six months. It’s a race against

the clock.”

A controversial new immigration bill adopted in December 2023 included numerous regressive measures, but the Constitutional Council, which reviews the constitutionality of legislation, rejected some of its provisions on procedural grounds in a ruling issued on January 25, 2024. It was not immediately clear how the bill’s remaining provisions would affect unaccompanied young migrants who have received a negative initial age assessment and are seeking review of their cases by the juvenile judge.

Recommendations

To the French State

Ensure that all departments have sufficient funding and resources to carry out their child protection functions. · Ensure a sufficient supply of housing for all unaccompanied children in France, including by increasing spaces in emergency accommodation shelters.

To the Child Protection System (Aide Sociale à l’Enfance, ASE), the Bouches-du-Rhône Departmental Council (Conseil départemental), and Association Départementale pour le Développement des Actions de Prévention des bouches-du-rhônes (13) (ADDAP 13)

Ensure age assessments are used only when there are serious and credible doubts about an individual’s claim to be under the age of 18. Age assessments should seek to establish approximate age through interviews and review of documents, as recommended by international standards. These procedures should afford the benefit of the doubt, in line with international standards, so that if there is a possibility that an individual is a child, that individual is treated as a child .

in line with When there are serious uncertainties about an individual’s claim to be under the age of 18, ensure the age assessment procedures used are multidisciplinary in nature and conducted in a manner “characterized by neutrality and compassion.”

Ensure that age assessments are conducted in a way that is sensitive to the child’s age, sex, gender, psychological maturity, and emotional state.

Ensure that qualified interpreters assist unaccompanied migrant children.

Provide unaccompanied children with verbal and age-appropriate information about their rights and entitlements in France as children.

Ensure that all those who are awaiting an age assessment receive immediate emergency accommodation for the minimum period of five days or until the evaluation is completed, as required by article R.221-11 of the Code of Social Action and Families.

article R.221-11 of the Code of Social Action and Families. Ensure that the period of emergency accommodation is extended to cover any period of appeal of an adverse age determination.

Establish suitable separate accommodation for young adults and age-disputed cases, and in the meantime, ensure that there are adequate and protected places in existing facilities.

Ensure that emergency accommodation is safe, sanitary, child-friendly, and consistent with human dignity.

Issue and implement clear guidance to staff at ADDAP 13 that age assessments should follow French regulations, which require a comprehensive social evaluation by trained staff. In particular: Apply the presumption of minority, as required by French law. Afford the benefit of the doubt such that if there is a possibility that an individual is a child, he or she is treated as such. Consider foreign birth certificates and other civil documents as genuine unless there is concrete evidence to the contrary.

Implement the best practices guide published by the Directorate General of the French Ministry of Health ( Direction générale de la Santé , DGS) and the Directorate General of the Ministry of Solidarity and Social Cohesion ( Direction générale de la Cohésion sociale , DGCS). In particular: Ensure that within 48 hours of entering temporary emergency accommodation (APU), children benefit from an initial health assessment, distinct from the age assessment process, focusing on both physical and psychological aspects. Ensure that children have a comprehensive medical appointment, distinct from the age assessment process, with a state-certified nurse in close collaboration with a doctor at least three days after they are “stabilized in securing their basic needs.” Ensure that health assessments include sexual and reproductive health care, including informed and consensual screening for pregnancy, risk of violence, contraceptive needs, and access to emergency contraception or abortion if needed. Ensure that medical professionals evaluating children are appropriately trained in children’s health, cultural factors, and health outcomes related to migration, including post-traumatic stress and sexual and other gender-based violence. Ensure that health assessments are conducted in a confidential, patient-centered manner. Consider mental health and psychological well-being when determining if an individual is fit to undergo an age assessment. Provide children with their personal health information collected during the evaluation stage. Ensure that children have access to health care, including rights-respecting mental health care and psychosocial support. Ensure that children who have experienced mental health distress and/or have a mental health condition have access to reasonable accommodation during the age assessment process to ensure they can meaningfully participate. Ensure follow-up care and remind children of scheduled medical appointments.

, DGS) and the Directorate General of the Ministry of Solidarity and Social Cohesion ( , DGCS). In particular: Extend comprehensive universal health protection (Protection Universelle Maladie, PUMa), supplemented by complementary health insurance (Complémentaire Santé Solidaire, C2S), through any period of appeal of an adverse age determination.

To the Juvenile Court (Tribunal pour Enfants)

Judges should review negative age assessments without delay.

Judges should apply the presumption, as set forth in article 47 of the Civil Code, that identity documents issued abroad are valid.

To the Government, the National Assembly, and the Senate

Amend the Code of Social Action and Families to specify that age assessments be used as a matter of last resort, only when there are grounds for serious doubts about an individual’s declared age and where other approaches, including analysis of documentary evidence, have failed to establish an individual’s age.

Ensure that eligibility for residence permits and nationality upon reaching adulthood is calculated from the date an individual first seeks care from the child protection system, rather than the date they receive formal recognition, so that they are not disadvantaged by delays in the age assessment process.

To the Ministry of Education

Ensure that all unaccompanied migrant children in France have access to education, in line with French law and international standards.

Ensure that children are enrolled in school without delay.

Ensure that school authorities have the necessary resources to provide education for all children, and to provide psychological counseling when needed.

To the Ministry of Health and Prevention

Ensure that all unaccompanied migrant children have the right to timely and unconditional access to comprehensive universal health protection (PUMa and C2s) upon entering the period of temporary emergency accommodation.

Ensure that adequate and rights-respecting mental health services and psychosocial support are available for all individuals.

Make interpreters available for medical appointments, including those for mental health services.

Ensure that unaccompanied migrant children are able to receive without delay the health care they need, including the full range of sexual and reproductive health care services, through appropriate steps such as the removal of barriers to effective access, such as formal or de facto requirements for them to be under the care of the child protection system.

Methodology

This report is based on 58 interviews, including 18 with asylum seekers and migrants in Marseille who identified themselves as children under the age of 18. All unaccompanied migrant children interviewed were male: the vast majority of unaccompanied migrant children entering France are boys, and although we attempted to identify unaccompanied girls who would speak with us, we were unable to do so. The interviews were carried out between March 2023 and July 2023. The unaccompanied children were from Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Gambia, Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire, the Republic of Guinea (often referred to as Guinea Conakry to distinguish it from Guinea-Bissau and Equatorial Guinea), and Sierra Leone.

In addition, Human Rights Watch spoke with 40 staff of humanitarian agencies, lawyers, health care providers including pediatricians, other doctors, social workers, child psychologists, local authority workers, and volunteers who assist with housing and legal proceedings, or run activities for young migrants and asylum seekers in Marseille.

Human Rights Watch also reviewed case files, including negative age assessments issued by the Association Départementale pour le Développement des Actions de Prévention des bouches-du-rhônes (13) (ADDAP 13), the association delegated by the Bouches-du-Rhône departmental council to conduct age assessments. Human Rights Watch met with ADDAP 13 and subsequently sought and received its written observations on the findings of this report. We have included excerpts of these observations in relevant sections of the report. Human Rights Watch also sought written comment from the Bouches-du-Rhône departmental council but did not receive a reply before this report was finalized for publication.

Human Rights Watch researchers conducted interviews in French and English. Before each interview, we explained to all interviewees the nature and purpose of our research, that the interviews were voluntary and confidential, and that they would receive no personal service, benefit, or compensation for speaking to us. We obtained verbal consent from each interviewee, and all interviewees were told they could stop the interview at any time and decline to answer any question. Interviews were semi-structured and covered a range of topics related to access to health care, housing, legal representation, and children’s rights. Most interviews were conducted in person and some by phone. The average length of each interview was approximately one hour. Human Rights Watch took precautions to avoid re-traumatizing the children interviewed for this report.

All names of children used in this report are pseudonyms. In descriptions of medical cases, we assigned a pseudonym consisting of a randomly chosen initial and omitted the precise age, country of origin, and date of arrival at the request of the individual or the organizations working with these children.

In line with international standards, the term “child” refers to a person under the age of 18. As the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child and other international authorities do, we use the term “unaccompanied children” in this report to refer to children “who have been separated from both parents and other relatives and are not being cared for by an adult who, by law or custom, is responsible for doing so.”

The term “migrant” is not defined in international law; our use of this term is in its “common lay understanding of a person who moves away from his or her place of usual residence, whether within a country or across an international border, temporarily or permanently, and for a variety of reasons.” It includes asylum seekers and refugees, and “migrant children” includes asylum-seeking and refugee children. Some groups in France, including the French Defender of Rights (Défenseur des droits, DDD), use the term “exile” in preference to “migrant.”

Unaccompanied Migrant Children in Marseille

Tens of thousands of young migrants arrive in France each year on their own. While arrivals diminished in 2020 due to movement restrictions linked to the Covid-19 pandemic, the number of unaccompanied migrant children received by departments across France increased in 2021 and 2022. Marseille is no exception: in 2022, there were an estimated 950 unaccompanied migrant children registered as having entered the city, of which only 2 percent were girls, according to the nongovernmental group delegated by the Bouches-du-Rhône department to handle their reception and evaluation. While Marseille is a destination city for unaccompanied migrant children, the number of unaccompanied children who travel there each year is not particularly large in absolute terms, meaning that child protection authorities should be able to make adequate arrangements for these arrivals.

Some children choose to come on their own to Marseille because they speak French and because of their sense of historic ties between their home countries and France. Others have no explicit destination in mind when they leave their home country. Many of the children Human Rights Watch spoke with ended up in Marseille by chance because of individuals who helped them on their journey, or because they encountered difficulties or discrimination in other places.

Once in Marseille, half of all unaccompanied children who undergo age assessments are denied recognition of their minority. The reasons for denial often seem arbitrary, a conclusion that is reinforced by the fact that nearly 75 percent of those who appeal the decision ultimately receive formal recognition as children, according to estimates from lawyers providing legal assistance to these children. In the meantime, however, they experience protracted periods of uncertainty and remain in limbo, without access to health care, housing, and specialized child protection services.

Most unaccompanied migrant children we spoke with in Marseille were from West Africa. The most common countries of origin were Guinea, Mali, and Côte d’Ivoire, groups that work with unaccompanied children told Human Rights Watch.

The reasons children gave for leaving their country of origin varied. Many of the children Human Rights Watch spoke with described fleeing abusive family situations, particularly after the death of one or both parents. For example, Ibrahima N., a 16-year-old boy from Guinea, said, “When my father died, I had to go live with my dad’s younger brother, and he was not nice to me. He had two wives and my mother refused to become his third wife and he let that anger out on me. He hurt me. Until one day my neighbor helped me leave.”

Some children said they were targeted or threatened because of their or their families’ religion or perceived political views. “My dad arrived home one day, I was eating, and he said I needed to finish fast since we had to run,” Kwame B., a 15-year-old Ghanaian, told us, explaining that his father was politically opposed to the local government. “He is my father, he’s my everything, so when he told me to follow him, I listened.”

Others left their home countries after being subjected to trafficking or forced labor. For example, Souleymane K., the 16-year-old from Côte d’Ivoire whose account appears at the beginning of this report, showed us scars on his face that he said were from a trafficking ringleader:

I loved going to school, but I stopped because my mother didn’t have the means to pay. Then I met a man on the street who told me to come to his house because he would find me work. I went and there were so many kids there. I stole for this man. We didn’t have a choice … I needed to do it to have food for me and my mom. If we didn’t bring anything back to his home at the end of the day, he would hit and cut us.

Most children we spoke with traveled by land to Libya, crossed the Mediterranean by inflatable boat to Italy, and then took the train or walked through the Alps to arrive in France. We heard numerous accounts of boats that ran out of fuel or broke down at sea. Sixteen-year-old Malick S. from Guinea made the crossing in the winter of 2023 in a boat that capsized. “We ran out of gas. Everyone started to get so scared, water entered the boat, and many of us jumped into the water,” he said. Five hours later, a ship rescued the survivors and took them to Italy. He continued, “As soon as we were evacuated and I was in the hospital, I started to feel a lot of pain. I was so scared in the water that I didn’t notice how cold my body was until I had time to realize what I was feeling.”

Several unaccompanied children described being separated from a relative, parent, another trusted adult, or friend on the journey. Kwame B., the 15-year-old Ghanaian, said, “My father and I were separated when we took different boats to leave Libya … now I don’t have a mother or a father. Where should I go?” Mamadou O., a 16-year-old from Guinea, watched his football trainer drown in the Mediterranean when their boat sunk. He told us, “I didn’t know the way, but my trainer did … we left him in the water, he died there. I never saw him again.” Ibrahima N., a 16-year-old boy from Guinea, explained:

I left Guinea with my neighbor. I was with him until Tunisia but there was not enough room on the boat, so I went alone. I was very scared. I even cried. When I arrived in Italy, I called a friend to find out what happened to my neighbor. He told me that his ship had sunk and that he passed away.

Arduous journeys, unstable living conditions, and lack of access to child protection have adverse consequences on unaccompanied migrant children’s physical and mental health. Psychologists, social workers, and doctors all told Human Rights Watch that children frequently arrive in Marseille in critical or vulnerable states. “When they get to France, these kids are often psychologically traumatized and in very poor health … many arrive in a fragile and chronically exhausted state linked to lack of access to basic needs,” a social worker treating children told Human Rights Watch.

The cases in this report document the harmful consequences of erroneously and arbitrarily considering unaccompanied children as adults and keeping them outside of the child protection system in Marseille. While these children wait for their case to be heard by the juvenile judge, they live a precarious existence where they are denied the right to housing, health, education, and food and deprived of essential needs, including clothing and hygiene.

A controversial new immigration bill adopted in December 2023 included numerous regressive provisions, including restrictions on social benefits for noncitizens, on birthright citizenship for children born in France to parents who are not French, and on family reunification. The Constitutional Council, which reviews the constitutionality of legislation, struck these provisions on procedural grounds, along with many others, in a ruling issued on January 25, 2024.

The immigration bill also authorized the creation of a new registry of “delinquent unaccompanied minors” (mineurs non-accompagnés délinquants) that authorities would presumably use in decisions on residence permits and citizenship applications made by unaccompanied youth at age 18. The Constitutional Council allowed this provision to stand.

A measure that would have abolished state medical aid (Aide médicale de l’État, AME) for people in irregular migration status was dropped from the bill before its adoption, although the government has committed to a reform of the health system in 2024. The bill retained a proposal to prohibit the administrative detention of noncitizen children, initially limited to children under 16 but amended before enactment to apply to all children under 18.

It was not immediately clear how the bill’s remaining provisions would affect unaccompanied young migrants who have received a negative initial age assessment and are seeking review of their cases by the juvenile judge.

Arbitrary Age Determination Practices

Each administrative department in France handles the reception and evaluation of unaccompanied young migrants in its own way. Some departments carry out age assessments themselves; others contract with agencies to do so. For Marseille and elsewhere in Bouches-du-Rhône, the department has designated the Association Départementale pour le Développement des Actions de Prévention des bouches-du-rhônes (13) (ADDAP 13), a nongovernmental group, to evaluate the child’s situation to confirm whether he or she is under the age of 18 and determine his or her unaccompanied status.

Child protection is a departmental responsibility, not a national one, meaning the department covers most of the costs related to unaccompanied migrant children who are taken into care. The care of one unaccompanied child by the child protection system (Aide Sociale à l’Enfance, ASE)—covering accommodation, food, education, and training—costs on average 50,000 euros per year. As Human Rights Watch has observed in its reporting on the situation of unaccompanied children elsewhere in France, this financial obligation can create an incentive to subject unaccompanied children to unnecessary and abusive age assessments.

While half of all unaccompanied children who undergo age assessments in Marseille are initially denied recognition of their age, nearly 75 percent of those who seek review are ultimately granted minority status by a juvenile judge.

Age Assessments

The assessment is aimed at evaluating the individual’s “declarations regarding his identity, his age, his family of origin, his nationality and his unaccompanied status.”

International standards call for children undergoing age assessments to receive the presumption of minority and the benefit of the doubt “such that if there is a possibility that the individual is a child, he or she should be treated as such.” But as Franck Ozouf, manager of the unaccompanied migrant children (MNA) project at Secours Catholique Caritas France, remarked, “The presumption of minority exists in law to a certain point but no longer exists in practice. When the department refuses to recognize a child’s minority and unaccompanied status, there is a real legal void in terms of protection. Even if the child is eventually brought before the juvenile judge, there is no emotional appeal, there is no welfare, there is no accompaniment.”

By law, the evaluation should take the form of a “multidisciplinary” interview that considers the youth’s reasons for leaving the country of origin, family background, and state of unaccompanied status. Evaluations should also be conducted in a manner “characterized by neutrality and compassion.” However, the age assessment process in Marseille does not appear to take into account children’s emotional and communication needs, despite the well-documented effects of post-traumatic stress disorder on memory, concentration, and the expression of emotion.

Age assessments for unaccompanied migrant children in Marseille should last between 45 minutes and one hour and a half. Several children we spoke with said their interviews were much shorter. In addition, children said they did not always understand the purpose of the interview, the examiners’ questions, or the interpreter. “My ADDAP 13 examiner was Senegalese, and we didn’t speak the same language … she didn’t understand me, and I didn’t understand her. I didn’t know French, so I spoke in Susu and that was it. The evaluation was about a half hour and then they told me I wasn’t a minor,” Salimatou A., a 17-year-old boy from Guinea, told us.

Upon completing the age assessment, the child is either recognized as a minor and taken into care by the child protection system (ASE) or declared an adult and thus disqualified from any material benefits afforded to children or eligibility for residence permits upon adulthood.

According to lawyers in Marseille, until a year ago, children waited several months to undergo age assessments, but now ADDAP 13 evaluates children within one week of arrival. Volunteers, lawyers, and doctors told us that while the shorter time frame is a positive development in the sense that youth are not waiting for protracted periods without having the opportunity to begin the age assessment process, it also means that those who receive negative age assessments are stripped of accommodation and protection more rapidly.

A doctor who treats unaccompanied migrant children in Marseille commented that “[t]he institutions are completely saturated and conduct quicker age assessments … children are therefore placed in shelters to be assessed, often after several weeks of waiting, then for some, quickly put back on the street without being granted any rights.” This is consistent with statistics provided by ADDAP 13 showing that the number of unaccompanied migrant children in Marseille who were formally recognized and taken into care by the child protection system in 2022 was nearly 25 percent lower than what was recorded in 2021.

Frequent reasons listed for denying children in Marseille formal recognition as children were “physical appearance,” “stress,” “confusion and inconsistency of speech,” and “too much confidence,” lawyers from the Unaccompanied Minors Commission of the Marseille Bar Association told Human Rights Watch. Such grounds and the lawyers’ observations during interviews suggest that examiners are evaluating children too soon after their arrival in Marseille, before they have recovered from their journey, and not adequately taking into account the impact of children’s time in transit. “They are presented an ‘initial contact form’ which has [the child’s] photo on it … a photo taken when the child had just arrived in France after an arduous journey and has slept on the street for several nights,” lawyers with the Marseille Bar Association’s Unaccompanied Minors Commission said.

Human Rights Watch reviewed case files that suggest other arbitrary grounds on which authorities have rejected children’s claims to be underage. In one case, a boy received a negative age assessment based in part on his decision to call his lawyer to ask for help with a health condition. On his denial letter, it stated “when he has concerns, he prefers to refer to his lawyer.”

In fact, lawyers with the Marseille Bar Association’s Unaccompanied Minors Commission said, “From the documents we are presented when taking on cases, it seems to us that there are many ADDAP 13 evaluators making their decision [regarding the child’s minority] before they even meet them in person.”

Such accounts and the case files Human Rights Watch reviewed are similar to those we saw in Paris and the Hautes-Alpes, where some youths requesting protection from the child protection system received negative assessments based on appearance alone, and others were rejected on other clearly arbitrary grounds, including work in countries of origin or transit, irritation in the face of repeated questions, or responses that are consistent with trauma.

ADDAP 13 included the following points in its written reply to Human Rights Watch’s request for comment:

Our assessments are carried out by a multidisciplinary team made up of legal experts and specialized educators. The framework and objectives of the assessment mission are clearly formalized for both professionals and individuals presenting themselves as minors.

. . . .

Interviews are systematically conducted by a legal expert from our team, with the assistance of an interpreter whenever necessary to ensure legality and fairness. At the end of the interview, a meeting is organized with the multidisciplinary team to reach either a clear minority/majority decision or, in case of doubt, a request for further information.

When they are admitted to the shelter, young people are taken into care by the educational team and systematically asked in which language they would like the interview to be conducted. Interpreters are physically present, except when there is no interpreter in the area for the language requested. In this case, we use a telephone service. At the start of the interview, the young person is systematically asked to confirm that he or she understands the information exchanged with the interpreter. The young person can ask the evaluators to change interpreters at any time. In this case, the interview is stopped and postponed until a suitable interpreter meeting the needs of the young person can be found.

. . . .

If the young person's emotional, physical, or psychological state prevents him/her from expressing him/herself or answering questions, the interview will be postponed…. If several interviews are necessary, they must be at least 24 hours apart, and if necessary, other professionals must be called in.

Throughout the interview, the evaluators check with the young person to make sure they understand the exchanges. If there are any notable inconsistencies in the story, the evaluators point this out so that the young person can go back over his or her explanations if he or she so wishes. In accordance with the decree of November 20, 2019, the topics addressed in the context of gathering the young person's views are identical for all interviews: the person’s identity; specific elements if a civil status or identity document is presented; family situation; living conditions in the country of origin; reasons for leaving, stages and conditions of the migratory journey; conditions of entry and life in France; plans; overview of human rights, asylum, and human trafficking.

. . . .

There are no instructions given to evaluators ‘on the relevance of assessing age on the basis of elements such as traveling alone, working during migration, and speaking French or other languages that are not the native language.’ They are asked to apply the regulatory provisions as well as the recommendations for good professional practice, which are published by the French National Authority for Health (haute autorité de santé, HAS) and worked on as a team. Furthermore, as already indicated, our teams do not assess the age of the people they interview, but rather their isolation and minority status.

The Appeals Process

With the help of volunteers from several humanitarian groups, youth who are faced with denial of age recognition are connected to a lawyer to help them seek review of adverse age assessments before a juvenile judge. A lawyer from the Unaccompanied Minors Commission of the Marseille Bar Association told us:

Each week, we receive 15 requests ... this doesn’t mean we necessarily take on 15 new cases because some [children] may choose to continue on to a different department. But I would say we take on about 10 new cases each week.

The juvenile judge is not bound by any timeline to review cases. According to lawyers, the process takes on average three to six months but can last as long as a year. Omar J., an 18-year-old Gambian boy, was 16-and-a-half when he began his appeals process. He was recognized as a minor by the juvenile judge two weeks before his eighteenth birthday, a considerable delay that was consistent with other cases reported to us.

Human Rights Watch also heard of cases where delays were so long that hearings were set to take place after the child’s eighteenth birthday. Such instances can affect children’s eligibility for residence permits and French nationality.

Arbitrary Requirements for or Rejection of Identity Documents

The age determination process has become increasingly difficult because evaluators and some judges require children to produce specific documents even though the applicable regulations call for a holistic assessment based on the child’s account and other available evidence. Since many children either leave their country of origin without their identity documents or lose them in transit, the de facto requirement to produce documents frequently leads to delays in considering cases.

Mamadou O., a 16-year-old from Guinea, arrived in Marseille after making a crossing to Italy in a boat that held more than 40 people and capsized. He told Human Rights Watch that he was surprised to receive an initial negative age assessment. He said, “They told me that without my paperwork, they couldn’t say I was a minor. But I came on a boat, I didn’t have the documents in my pocket. My mother had them [in Guinea] and she passed away once I arrived in France.”

Kwame B., a 15-year-old Ghanaian who was denied his minority in September 2022 and by January 2024 had still been waiting for a judge to review his case, said, “There are a lot of problems with my papers. In December 2022, I went to Paris to do my passport because the lawyer said I had to. Seven months have passed and nothing.”

Children

“documents that are available should be considered genuine unless there is proof to the contrary”

—

Children seeking review of adverse age assessments also face obstacles as judges increasingly exclude their identity documents from consideration. According to the Unaccompanied Minors Commission of the Marseille Bar Association, there are now more judges requiring a procedure known as a jugement supplétif,

or “supplementary judgement,” which typically requires the production of witnesses in a court in the country of origin who can attest to a child’s birth and parentage.

Drissa K., a 16-year-old boy from Côte d’Ivoire, expressed anxiety at the time of our interview because his mother didn’t have the money to travel from his hometown to the capital to obtain a supplementary judgement on his behalf.

with a supplementary judgment … now my

who do have documents are also frequently rejected. Despite the presumption in French law that foreign documents are valid —and international standards noting thatchild protection officials regularly ask for documents such as birth certificates or passports to be authenticated by embassies. Volunteers, lawyers, and children themselves said that this process is costly and can take months. Even when children have certified documents issued by a judge in the country of origin, French officials often refuse to consider them. “I don’t know what more they want from me. I’ve filed my paperwork; I have my certified consular documentlawyers tell me that I need a passport. But I don’t have the means to go to Paris alone to get it, so I’m stuck,” Seydou K., a 15-year-old boy from Burkina Faso, told Human Rights Watch.

These accounts are not uncommon. According to a volunteer from the association Soutien 59 Saint-Just that helps unaccompanied migrant children gather and authenticate documentary evidence of age, providing supplementary documents does not necessarily guarantee that a child will receive an audience in front of a juvenile judge: “I’ve helped children who got very attached to the idea of their biometric passport arriving, only to later be refused an audience with the judge,” he told us. This is not unique to Marseille: in March 2023, a Pakistani teenager was denied recognition of his minority in Lyon despite providing original copies of his birth certificate and identity card to the juvenile judge.

ADDAP 13 included the following in its written reply to Human Rights Watch’s request for comment:

With regard to identity documents presented during the assessment interview, please note that the possibility of having civil status documents has no direct bearing on the assessment. If the young person has such documents and wishes to present them to the evaluator, the latter will ask him/her whether he/she wishes to entrust them to the service or have them photocopied. If the young person's response is positive, the documents will be secured by a procedure whereby they are placed in a safe by a department manager on the administrative premises, with access strictly limited and controlled. A register will be kept, and a receipt for the deposit of the document will be given to the young person, together with a copy of the deed. At this point, the evaluators explain to the young person the risks to which he or she may be exposed in the event of presenting false papers or declarations. If the young person accepts, the service will forward the document to the Departmental Council, which will have the option of submitting it to the border police for documentary examination if there is any doubt as to the young person’s minority.

Lack of Access to Housing

Half of all unaccompanied migrant children entering Marseille receive a negative age assessment. As an immediate consequence, within 48 hours of an adverse age determination, children who are deemed to be adults are evicted from emergency accommodation provided by ADDAP 13, even though many will eventually receive formal recognition of their minority when a judge reviews their cases. These children find themselves uniquely disadvantaged—they are unable to access the protections afforded to children yet remain ineligible for accommodation in adult reception centers because their identity documents indicate they are under 18.

The failure of the department to provide adequate alternative accommodation means these children must fend for themselves or seek assistance from ordinary citizens or nongovernmental organizations in Marseille to find shelter.

Temporary Emergency Accommodation

Once children present themselves as unaccompanied to ADDAP 13, they are entitled to temporary emergency accommodation (accueil provisoire d’urgence, APU) while they wait for an age assessment. Despite this legal obligation, there have historically been delays of up to four months for children to receive this temporary accommodation. In the meantime, many find themselves living on the streets.

When we asked ADDAP 13 about these delays, its staff initially stated that there are only 150 temporary emergency accommodation spots available in their facilities. Deputy Director David Le Monnier told Human Rights Watch that during the first six months of 2023, the agency had initial contact with about 800 youth in Marseille seeking to enter the minority and isolation assessment process. “The law says that they should enter temporary emergency accommodation with the shortest delays possible. But I won’t hide that in practice, it’s not always as evident as that,” he said. In October 2023, however, ADDAP 13 stated that by the end of 2022, “we achieved immediate sheltering for all young people presenting themselves to our service.” The agency informed us that it had increased the number of available temporary placements to 240:

[A]n increase in the number of migrants presenting themselves as minors can saturate the system and, given the number of spots available, hamper their immediate accommodation. That is why during peak periods, we implement the following system: a substantial increase in the number of temporary placements, without [the need for advance] authorization and on an exceptional basis, in order to be able to shelter as many young people as possible for evaluation. That is why we regularly operate in excess of the 120 authorized spots. At present, following the major waves of migration seen since September, and with the agreement of the Departmental Council, we are taking in more than 240 young people, that is twice the number of regularly authorized spots.

This willingness to address the challenges posed by increases in arrivals is welcome. Nonetheless, we continued to hear in mid-2023 that unaccompanied children faced delays with temporary emergency accommodation. In addition, although beyond the scope of this report, we also heard—and the agency itself observed in a 2022 report—that unaccompanied children whose minority was formally recognized had few suitable options for long-term placements. Pregnant girls and children with mental health needs, among others, faced particular housing challenges.

According to Cyril Farnarier, coordinator of Project ASSAb aimed at improving access to health care for homeless adults, children, and families in Marseille, “There has been an explosion in the number of young migrants on the street in Marseille, but the means provided by the department haven’t followed. While we could legitimately complain that ADDAP13 isn’t doing enough, concretely they don’t have the means to do a good job.”

Human Rights Watch heard numerous accounts of children who arrived at ADDAP13 and were turned away because facilities were at capacity. While some children were taken in by volunteer collectives or families while they waited for a spot to become available, many had no other option but to sleep outside.

Ibrahima N., a 16-year-old boy from Guinea, said that the day he arrived from Italy, a volunteer at the train station oriented him towards ADDAP 13 where he was told there was no spot available for him: “They told me to come back every day. I slept on the street and returned each morning [to ADDAP 13]. There was no room for me until April 13, 11 days later.”

Similarly, Isaac T., a 15-year-old boy from Côte d’Ivoire, said, “I slept underneath the staircase of the Saint-Charles railway station for one week until they had a bed for me at the hotel.” Sixteen-year-old Mamadou O. from Guinea said, “When I arrived, I stayed alone and slept for five days on the street, I didn’t know what else to do.”

In some cases, ordinary citizens open their homes to give children a place to stay for a night or two, or even longer. Kwame B., a 15-year-old Ghanaian boy, told us, “When I arrived in Marseille, ADDAP 13 told me there was nowhere for me yet, so I slept outside for four days. I met a Ghanaian man at the train station … He took me to his house and fed me until finally a week later I got a place in the hotel.”

More generally, children described the uncertainty and distress associated with not having stable accommodation. “It’s hard because I always sleep in squats, and I don’t feel good there. I don’t know where I’ll sleep next,” Moussa E., a 17-year-old boy from Guinea, told Human Rights Watch in June, adding, “This isn’t the France that I imagined. Everyone says that France represents liberty, but I don’t feel free right now. The reality is that if it weren’t for this association [Collectif 113], I would be completely abandoned.”

Seydou K., a 15-year-old from Burkina Faso who arrived in Marseille in November 2022, told us that he had slept in five different beds before arriving at the Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders or MSF) house in the summer of 2023. “It’s exhausting to sleep in so many different places and not know what comes next,” he said.

Children face difficulties accessing shelter in other departments across France. A 2021 report by Le Comede and MSF found that 55 percent of unaccompanied migrant children receiving care at an MSF health center in Paris were homeless, yet only 5 percent of them had lived on the street in their home country.

After complaints filed by associations against the department of Bouches-du-Rhône, and reports by the French Defender of Rights (Défenseur des droits) and the General Inspectorate for Social Affairs (Inspection Générale des Affaires Sociales, IGAS), the delays in granting children temporary emergency accommodation have decreased since mid-2022. However, according to lawyers, volunteers, and humanitarian workers in Marseille, the unforeseen consequence of reduced delays is that children are now denied legal recognition of their age much more quickly and, as described more fully in the next section, face homelessness as a result.

According to Cyril Farnarier, “In order to keep the machinery running under pressure, ADDAP 13 organizes a fast turnover at the hotel … so you have kids being kicked out of the temporary hotel faster than before, over half of whom are reevaluated later on and granted their minority by the juvenile judge.”

Housing Following a Negative Age Assessment

According to volunteers, as of January 2024, there are at least 150 children in Marseille who are not provided with accommodation after a negative age assessment and who face the stress and danger of being homeless.

In the absence of laudable efforts by a strong network of local associations and volunteers, unaccompanied migrant children in Marseille would be left to navigate the uncertainty of finding accommodation on their own. Roughly 20 children are lodged at the MSF shelter for unaccompanied migrant children in vulnerable health; another 25 children sleep in squats run by a group called Collectif 113; 50 children sleep in other squats, three of which are in buildings belonging to the city of Marseille; and 40 are housed with host families through a volunteer-led organization called RAMINA (Réseau d’Accueil des MInots Non Accompagnés).

In rare cases, children are housed in an emergency accommodation and social reintegration center (CHRS, Centre d'Hébergement et de Réinsertion Sociale). However, several volunteers described the shelter as not suitable for children: “[CHRS] are large mixed structures of up to 180 adults, many of whom have been living on the street for years or suffer from substance abuse … it’s a very difficult environment and not meant for children.”

In addition, ADDAP 13 informed Human Rights Watch that it had an agreement with the Departmental Council to accommodate up to 40 young people who are seeking review of negative age assessments:

Over the past year, we have developed a system to enable us to take in people who have lodged an appeal. With the agreement of the Departmental Council, 40 young people are accommodated in one of our facilities in Marseille, when a provisional placement order (OPP) has been issued to enable further investigations (document verification or bone testing). Our aim is twofold: to ensure that these people receive educational, health and social care until the court has made its decision, and to avoid saturating the system so as to be able to place new people in shelters.

This initiative is positive but limited in scope: not only is the number of placements much lower than is needed, but eligibility also appears to be restricted to young people who have already sought judicial review and who have received a provisional placement order.

Nearly every volunteer or humanitarian aid worker whom Human Rights Watch spoke with mentioned having opened their home to a young migrant at some point, ranging from a few nights to months at a time. Dominique Zavagli, former president of the association RAMINA, commented:

When we first meet the youth, we put out a call to RAMINA’s networks to see if we can find them a place to sleep. We have about 200 people on our volunteer list, but only 30 are active. If there is no room to offer them, we do as much as we can … we buy them a slice of pizza, get their phone number, give them a duvet.

Many children indicated that without help from associations, they would have had nowhere to turn. Salimatou A., a 17-year-old boy from Guinea, told us:

The evaluation was about half an hour and then they told me I wasn’t a minor and I had to leave the hotel. I slept there for one more night and then I was put on the street. Later someone gave me the telephone number of a woman [from Collectif 113]. She found me a bed in a room in this squat, and I’ve been here ever since.

Mamadou O., the 16-year-old boy from Guinea, arrived in Marseille in mid-February of 2023. When he received a negative age assessment in March, he had nowhere to go.

He explained:

ADDAP 13 made me leave the hotel and I slept on the street for three days. On the fourth day, I met a man who gave me the number of an association. When I called, they told me, ‘Today, we don’t have room for you, but tomorrow we can try.’ So I slept on the street again. At 8 a.m. the next day, they called me and told me there was a spot for me.

In a similar account, Ibrahima N., another 16-year-old boy from Guinea, told us, “When I did the evaluation, they told me that I wasn’t a minor. They handed me a piece of paper and the following day they made me leave the hotel. Luckily my friend told me to call Collectif 113 to see if they had a spot for me. And then I came here.”

When asked about these accounts, a doctor who treats these children remarked, “When kids are told they’re not minors, the state doesn’t even provide them with nights in a shelter. They are thrown to the streets just like that, like an old pair of socks.”

Sleeping on the street has serious adverse consequences on children’s sense of safety, security, and mental health. Girls on the street are especially at risk of human trafficking and sexual and other gender-based violence. A volunteer told Human Rights Watch:

If you do not have your primary needs met, how can you worry about the rest? How can you go through an appeals process, go to your lawyer, ask for your documents from your country … if you don’t even have a roof over your head? These kids are in a constant state of survival.

Omar J., a Gambian boy, told us he was 16 when he was kicked out of ADDAP 13 accommodation after a negative age assessment. He spent four months living and sleeping on the street until Collectif 113 took him in. A volunteer working at the squat said, “When he arrived at the house, he was so afraid of knives. For the first few weeks, we had to hide all the knives in the house so he would not shake in fear.”

These accounts are not unusual. Federico Colombo, a legal expert, commented:

It’s ironic because ADDAP 13’s motto is “educating in the street” and given the level of abandonment and poor support they give these kids, it’s almost as if ADDAP 13 really believes the street should take care of these kids, and they leave them there.

Barriers to Health Care

The French state has a responsibility to ensure individuals have access to suitable accommodation, regardless of their age. It has additional obligations toward children, including to provide them appropriate protection and care and ensure their survival and development. Given that three-quarters of initial age assessment decisions are overturned on review, the department should take all feasible steps to ensure that children are provided withnot left to sleep on the street while they exercise their right to review of negative age assessments.

The administrative steps required to obtain health coverage in France are complex for adults to understand, let alone for unaccompanied children who have just arrived, many of whom do not speak French. Children awaiting age assessments or who have not received formal recognition as minors are ineligible for comprehensive universal health protection, leading to difficulties in accessing timely care and to frequent refusals of surgeries and operations.

Health Coverage

In France, there are several tiers of health care. For individuals with regularized immigration status and asylum seekers, there is universal health protection (Protection Universelle Maladie, PUMa) which can be supplemented by complementary health insurance (Complémentaire Santé Solidaire, C2S) for individuals with income under a specific level to cover expenses exceeding the state reimbursement threshold. For foreign nationals with irregular migration status, there is state medical aid (Aide médicale de l’État, AME), which provides minimal protection with a reduced range of care and services.

Only the child protection system (Aide Sociale à l’Enfance, ASE) or the juvenile justice department (Direction de la protection judiciaire de la jeunesse, DPJJ) can unlock the right to PUMa and C2S for unaccompanied migrant children. Since formal recognition as a child is the first step to entry into the child protection system, youth whose minority is not formally recognized—according to a 2011 joint ministerial circular, those “without any ties, without support from any structure”—can thus only benefit from state medical aid (AME).

Under French law, children cannot technically be considered irregular because they are not obliged to present a residence permit (titre de séjour). According to MSF France’s advocacy manager, Euphrasie Kalolwa, classifying an unaccompanied child who is not formally recognized as such as irregular is contrary to their rights:

It’s a way for the administration to reinforce [its view that] that the young person is of legal age. When you sleep in an adult shelter, when you only have access to state medical aid intended for irregular migrants above the age of 18 ... [the only] elements that you could put on the table to show your administrative social situation will indicate that you are of legal age.

Domiciliation and Three-Month Waiting Period

Access to AME is subject to obtaining a residence address (domiciliation) where an individual can receive mail. For adults with irregular migration status, it is possible to obtain such an address from a local social welfare center (Centre communal d’action sociale, CCAS) or a domiciliation agency (organisme domiciliataire). However, these centers generally refuse to register children without formal documentation proving recognition or refusal of their minority, meaning that unaccompanied children still in the temporary emergency accommodation (APU) period are left without the possibility of accessing this option.

To access AME, individuals must also be able to justify three months of residence on French territory. Per a 2011 joint ministerial circular, unaccompanied migrant children are exempt from this requirement. However, departments do not always follow the rule set forth in the circular, according to volunteers. As a result, it can be complicated for children who are waiting for age assessments or who have not been formally recognized as children to gain access to health coverage. This is a problem across many French departments, including Marseille: in 2022, 97.1 percent of unaccompanied migrant children who visited over a dozen Médecins du Monde health centers across the country were not covered by any type of health insurance.

State Medical Aid Through ADDAP 13

In Marseille, through an agreement with the local social welfare center, unaccompanied migrant children whose minority has been recognized can obtain domiciliation, and subsequent access to state medical aid (AME), through Médecins du Monde or a hospital-based medical center for individuals without health care coverage (Permanence ď Accès aux Soins de Santé, PASS). However, volunteers and doctors told Human Rights Watch that social workers at ADDAP 13 do not help file the necessary documents to open the right to AME for these children. A doctor explained:

These kids are often not autonomous enough to take the steps needed to file the documentation for AME and they need a social worker to help … but neither the department’s social workers nor those at ADDAP 13 do it. We do it at PASS, and the social services at the hospital also do it, but for kids who don’t visit us or the hospital, they don’t have access to this right.

Legal Representation

ADDAP 13 told Human Rights Watch, “If the need for care is immediate, the medical staff will initiate a request for state medical aid (AME). For young people with an OPP [a provisional placement order] or for those benefitting from an administrative placement measure, AME is available.”

Under the French public health code, minors are required to obtain consent from a parent or legal representative for certain medical procedures. While unaccompanied migrant children cannot meet this prerequisite by nature of their circumstances, there are exceptions to the rule for all minors in France. Children above age 16 who are granted the right to PUMa and C2S health coverage through the child protection system are considered exempt from the obligation to obtain legal authorization from a parent or legal guardian and thus have complete autonomy over their health decisions. However, children who are not formally recognized as minors and who can only benefit from state medical aid (AME) do not benefit from this exemption and cannot obtain the necessary legal authorization.

Lucie Borel of Médecins du Monde Marseille told Human Rights Watch, “While a child may not be recognized as a minor by the department, in every other aspect of the French system, they are considered as such. [For example] … to get an operation, they need parental consent.” Medical professionals in Marseille described cases of children who were not granted authorization for medical procedures because they did not have a legal representative. Dr. Rémi Laporte, a pediatrician in Marseille who treats unaccompanied migrant children at a hospital-based medical center (Permanence ď Accès aux Soins de Santé, PASS) for patients without health care coverage, remarked that delaying non-urgent procedures until children reach the age of majority can result in complications:

If the child needs an urgent medical operation, the anesthesiologist will generally comply, but if it’s not urgent and there is no legal representative to provide authorization, the anesthesiologist will refuse … and the juvenile judge usually won’t reply if we ask for authorization … so for children who need non-urgent medical interventions, it’s difficult to receive a reply from the judge.



Negative Health Outcomes

Even if medical procedures and other health care are not strictly urgent, delays of several months or more can have adverse health consequences, as discussed more fully in the following section.

Unaccompanied migrant children often arrive in France after experiencing harms in their home countries; dangerous and arduous migratory journeys; ill treatment, forced labor without pay, and arbitrary detention in inhumane conditions by unidentified groups in Libya; and border crossings that put them at risk of violence. Upon reaching Marseille, most of these children are in vulnerable states of physical and mental health and may lack access to appropriate services.

While ADDAP 13 is responsible for performing an initial health assessment once youth enter the temporary emergency accommodation (APU) period and advised us that “[e]very young person is received by a nurse on the day of his or her admission [into APU] and receives a medical examination,” our research found that these assessments are not systematically performed. As a result, children who experience unmet health needs and are denied recognition of their age may be returned to the streets without treatment, psychosocial support, or follow-up care.

Physical Health

According to Médecins du Monde, nearly half of all unaccompanied migrant children who visited their national health centers in 2021 were diagnosed with a chronic health condition, defined broadly as a condition that is long-lasting, and nearly three out of five with an acute pathology, a condition that usually begins abruptly and has a short course. This is consistent with observations from Laporte:

I see a lot of traumatology, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and psychological issues from the journey. There are very few kids migrating with their families who have HIV, STIs, or hepatitis … yet I see many cases of those pathologies within the MNA [unaccompanied migrant children] community, owing to the risks they face because they are unaccompanied.

Another doctor treating unaccompanied children in Marseille told Human Rights Watch that upon reaching France, children are often chronically exhausted and their condition worsens due to difficulty accessing their primary needs. “ Precarious living conditions are dangerous for the physical integrity of unaccompanied minors and sometimes lead to hospitalizations lasting several days, which could be avoided. ”

Mental Health

Social workers, psychologists, and doctors treating unaccompanied migrant children in Marseille reported a high incidence of symptoms such as intrusive thoughts consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder, sleep difficulties, depression, and anxiety. While some children Human Rights Watch spoke with were able to explain what they were feeling, most did not have the technical vocabulary or emotional capacity to describe in detail their experiences or what they needed to recover.

Trauma from the Journey

The trauma unaccompanied children experience before, during, and after their journey to France is likely to be significant, psychologists and social workers suggested. This is consistent with previous research by Human Rights Watch documenting the mental health crisis among individuals seeking refuge in the European Union. Moreover, according to Marie Jacob, psychologist at Le Comede, “The secondary effects of trauma from a voyage by boat appear markedly greater on children than on adults.” Post-traumatic stress, linked to threatening, harmful, and potentially traumatic events, impacts children’s ability to recount their personal history and express themselves. This has implications for age assessments where examiners ask youth questions about their migratory journey, family background, and reasons for leaving the country of origin, all the while judging their ability to remember subtleties. A psychologist treating migrant children in Marseille explained, “The process of recounting painful and violent memories reactivates post-traumatic stress…. It forces children to relive past terrors as if they are happening in the present moment.” Social workers and volunteers told Human Rights Watch that the overwhelming majority of unaccompanied migrant children who arrive in Marseille have experienced some kind of trauma. “All of these kids have either escaped death or lost someone on the way here,” a Collectif 113 volunteer said.

Interviews with children, and anyone who may have experienced trauma, require expertise and care to avoid retraumatization. However, according to volunteers in Marseille, age assessments do not always tailor to the child’s mental health state or needs and often compound anxiety and trauma. Staff from Project ASSAb told us:

We see many children arriving with considerable psychological traumas from their migratory journey, kids who are not even able to recount their story because they’re too submerged, but the evaluation is done anyway. And if the result is negative, the child is put on the street immediately, even if he or she is completely overwhelmed.

Though emotional avoidance and memory loss are known to be two common defense mechanisms in individuals with trauma, examiners at ADDAP 13 often take these as signs of adulthood. As described by Lawyers from the Unaccompanied Minors Commission of the Marseille Bar Association, “Often times we see written down on age evaluations that the child recounted the loss of a loved one along the journey with ‘emotional detachment’ and that’s a reason to not believe their age.” Another generic justification for a negative age assessment on case files viewed by Human Rights Watch was “short-term memory problems.”

The fact that age assessments are conducted without taking into consideration children’s psychological vulnerability “constitutes an abuse of sorts,” said Julien Delozanne, of MSF Marseille.

In response to our request for comment, ADDAP 13 wrote:

With regard to the assessment interview and the person's state of health, as indicated in the section on the assessment, before any interview date is set, a review is carried out with the educational and medical team. If the professionals in charge of the young person report a situation of significant trauma, deficiencies, or a state of health too degraded to allow the exchange to proceed smoothly, the interview will be postponed and the Departmental Council informed. If necessary, an extension may be requested, and the person may continue to receive shelter.

Protracted Periods of Uncertainty

Our research found that the age assessment procedure and the ensuing lengthy periods of uncertainty and instability for children deemed adults heighten feelings of depression, anxiety, and self-harm. In a typical account, Moussa E., a 17-year-old boy from Guinea determined to be an adult after a flawed age assessment, told us, “I love music and football. But I don’t find joy in these things anymore because I’m waiting endlessly. I’ve had a lot of problems with my passport and with getting my documents. All my energy is spent waiting.”

After spending months to years on the move, the added stress associated with being rejected upon arrival in France has a detrimental effect on unaccompanied children’s mental health. MSF psychologist Julie Arçuby told Human Rights Watch that uncertainty regarding accommodation and the length and eventual outcome of judicial proceedings not only exacerbates existing mental health conditions but also causes new psychological distress:

I know kids who have already slept in ten beds since arriving in France, who aren’t yet recognized as minors and aren’t even at the end of their journey. The consequence of this insecurity on their mental health is enormous. The uncertainty exacerbates existing traumas, such as those linked to what happened in their home country, or the horrors they encountered on their journey to France.

Ibrahima N., a 16-year-old boy from Guinea, told us, “France was my dreamland but now that I am here, there are too many worries. I am always thinking about what will happen next. I really thought I would be accepted here … I didn’t think it would be this hard.”

Most children we interviewed told us they were deeply distressed awaiting the outcome of judicial hearings to review negative age assessment determinations. “My lawyer told me I’ll finally go to the judge next month, after one full year in France, but I don’t know what will happen. I’m losing time,” Syed A., a 17-year-old Bangladeshi boy, said. In a similar case, Salimatou A., a 17-year-old boy from Guinea, told us, “I have a lawyer. I send her messages, but she can’t always reply. I am stressed when people tell me it will take more time. It’s been a year and nothing. I continue waiting.”

Kwame B., a 15-year-old Ghanaian boy who, with the aid of lawyers, asked the juvenile judge to review his negative age assessment, told us in May 2023, “When my passport comes back, I will see the judge again. But it’s been eight months and I’m still waiting. I stopped calling my lawyer because when I do, I start to cry.” When we spoke to him again at the end of June, he still had no word on when he would hear the outcome of his case.

A psychologist providing psychosocial support to unaccompanied migrant children told us that “[t]he perpetual uncertainty that these children experience—the anxiety of the arrival of their 18th birthday and not knowing what might happen in the future—sustains their state of serious stress and depression.”

Initial Health Screening

Navigating the complexities of the French system is also especially bewildering for children and weighs on their mental health. “The law is often impossible to understand. It’s done on purpose … it’s a way, like others, of refusing the reception of migrant children on our territory,” a doctor treating youth in Marseille told Human Rights Watch.

Under French law, the department is responsible for carrying out “an initial assessment of the health needs of people presenting themselves as minors and temporarily or permanently deprived of the protection of their family… and, if necessary, an orientation for care.” The French Defender of Rights (Défenseur des droits) also advocates for unaccompanied individuals declaring themselves to be under age 18 to undergo a health check during the temporary emergency accommodation (APU) period.

In Marseille, ADDAP 13 is responsible for organizing this initial health assessment, including an examination adapted to the child’s age, a vaccination update, and a tuberculosis screening. Completion of this health check is a criterion for the state to financially contribute to expenses incurred by the department during the period of the age assessment and temporary emergency accommodation.

In 2022, the Directorate General of the French Ministry of Health (DGS) and the Directorate General of the Ministry of Solidarity and Social Cohesion (DGCS) published a best practices guide on the initial health needs assessment of unaccompanied children during the period of temporary emergency accommodation (APU). The guide recommends that children should benefit from an initial health interview within 48 hours of entering temporary emergency accommodation aimed at “identify[ing] a possible health problem requiring medical advice and/or urgent somatic and psychological care,” followed by a more complete medical appointment at least three days after they are “stabilized in securing their basic needs.”

Delayed Care During the Period of Temporary Emergency Accommodation

According to doctors and nurses specializing in the medical, psychological, and social care of unaccompanied minors in Marseille, health screenings during the temporary emergency accommodation period are not systematic. Children cannot attend appointments for information, screening and diagnosis for HIV, viral hepatitis, and STIs at dedicated free centers (Centre gratuit d'information, de dépistage et de diagnostic, CeGGID), or testing at national tuberculosis control centers (Centres de Lutte Anti-Tuberculeuse, CLAT) unless they are accompanied by an adult.

Julien Delozanne of the MSF project in Marseille told Human Rights Watch that “…[w]e often see kids [within MSF’s cohort] who never went to these centers for testing upon arriving at the departmental evaluation service….” Staff working at the Médecins du Monde Marseille drop-in health center noted that “ADDAP 13 may help the young migrant make an appointment at the CLAT but they don’t always accompany them, so we don’t know if they actually make it to the check-up.” And a pediatrician treating unaccompanied children said, “Technically, all [unaccompanied migrant children] who pass through ADDAP 13 should have an evaluation done by the CEGGID and CLAT, but it’s not very clear how many do. I’m not sure they all do, in fact, I believe it’s far from it.”

According to a nurse treating unaccompanied migrant children, only between 10 and 20 percent of the youth she treated had gone through a health screening during their temporary emergency accommodation period at ADDAP 13.

Undetected Health Conditions

We heard several cases in which unaccompanied children did not undergo health assessments upon arrival in Marseille and consequently faced delays in receiving necessary health treatment.

For example, A., a teenage girl from West Africa who fled a forced marriage in her country and experienced sexual violence on her journey through Tunisia, slept at the Marseille-Saint-Charles railway station until she was granted temporary emergency accommodation (APU) by DIMEF (Direction des Maisons de l'Enfance et de la Famille), a departmental service that houses children in critical or vulnerable situations.

Three weeks into her temporary emergency accommodation period she still had not undergone an initial health assessment and received a negative age assessment. When she felt ill, a volunteer suggested she visit Le Comede, an association providing health services to migrants and asylum seekers in Marseille. Once there, her medical exam showed that she was 11 weeks pregnant. Sabine Allier, the social worker who accompanied the girl to the hospital for an abortion, told Human Rights Watch that doctors expressed confusion and suspicion due to the inconsistency between the date of birth on her identity documents and the paperwork from the department rejecting her minority:

For any young girl, an abortion is already difficult, but when added to that you experience suspicion, it turns into an extremely violent moment. A bit of softness would help. The violence these kids face is from multiple sources.

Barriers such as administrative delays can prevent people from accessing abortion within legal time limits, which in France is the fourteenth week of pregnancy.

In another case, T., a teenage girl from West Africa, spent several weeks at ADDAP13 during her temporary emergency accommodation period before she underwent an age assessment and was denied recognition as a child. While waiting for her case to be seen by the juvenile judge, an association in Marseille took her to Le Comede where she discovered she was HIV-positive. When a volunteer accompanied her to the hospital to seek treatment, the doctors explained that since T. had no legal representative, it was unethical and illegal to provide her with treatment.

The volunteer told Human Rights Watch that in the absence of finding a legal representative, the association’s strategy is to show children’s negative age assessment from ADDAP 13 as a means of legitimizing their status as “adults” with the right to make informed decisions about their medical care. However, children are often afraid to use this approach for fear that it will impact their judicial proceedings.

The social worker accompanying T. said:

She has been in Marseille for a few months already. If she had undergone an initial health assessment during the period of her temporary emergency accommodation at ADDAP 13, she would not be experiencing this delay in treatment or be at risk of potentially transmitting HIV to others.

Even with documentation of a negative age assessment, there is no universally accepted approach by health professionals as to who can authorize medical treatment in cases of unaccompanied migrant children who are denied recognition of their minority, so the outcome is doctor- and case-dependent. MSF nurses described cases of other children who experienced delays in care due to administrative hurdles:

Last week I accompanied a young person to the hospital for an X-ray. We spent over an hour at the entry desk because hospital staff didn’t understand why the child had no legal representation. They didn’t want to provide us with labels for the scan, even though he was treated two months earlier in another hospital with no issue at all.

Doctors and nurses accompanying children to appointments told us these accounts are not unusual. According to a social worker, “The systems in place in France require these children to be adults to access care. It’s so absurd and abstract. It’s completely incomprehensible, even for us.”

Undetected Psychological Needs

As discussed above, the best practices guide stipulates that within 48 hours of entering temporary emergency accommodation, children should benefit from an initial health assessment focusing on both “somatic and psychic aspects, [such as] delusional remarks, incoherent remarks, difficulties of landmarks in time and space, memory lapses, etc.” Yet there is only one psychologist available in-house at ADDAP 13 to speak with children, provide psychosocial support, and suggest interventions if needed. “It’s a point we are trying to work on, notably because we’ve realized that for these children, traumas often resurface after they are taken in by us,” the director of ADDAP 13 told us.

Psychologists, social workers, and doctors told us of several accounts of children in Marseille who never underwent a psychological assessment during the period of age assessment and temporary emergency accommodation at ADDAP 13, were incorrectly deemed to be adults, and were later found to have experienced severe psychological trauma.

F., a teenage boy from Central Asia, left his country after his older brothers were killed by the Taliban. He was separated from his parents at the border between Iran and Turkey and later enslaved by boatmen for years because he couldn’t pay them. After traveling to several refugee camps in Romania, Austria, Slovakia, and Germany looking for his parents, he found his way to Marseille.

He received a negative age assessment even though he showed his birth certificate showing that he was under age 18 and was displaying psychological distress consistent with his account of his journey. After he was put on the street, a doctor treating children at a health center in Marseille found him and took him to the hospital, where he spent 15 days in a psychiatric ward. “He was in an extremely fragile state. He trembled, he had vivid nightmares about his mother, and he even had loss of consciousness, which we later found out was due to post-traumatic epilepsy [seizures occurring after head trauma],” the doctor told Human Rights Watch. F. continues to receive regular mental health treatment by a psychiatrist, the doctor said.

The doctor told us about another case of a young West African boy who showed visible signs of post-traumatic stress while at ADDAP 13 during his temporary emergency accommodation period. He was accompanied to different health centers across Marseille until a doctor from Permanence ď Accès aux Soins de Santé (PASS) eventually gave him a diagnosis of delirium and suggested a psychiatric evaluation. During the age assessment process, the examiners did not take into account the child’s mental health condition, and he received a negative age evaluation and was subsequently put on the street.

When staff from MSF found him in a squat in a state of “delirium,” with his mental health “completely deteriorated,” they took him to a psychiatric hospital. A doctor following the case told us, “These situations make us ask ourselves: ‘How can you evaluate a child in this state? And furthermore, how can you throw this child onto the street?’”

MSF Marseille and Le Comede are aware of other children who are in need of reasonable accommodation and safeguards to meaningfully participate in age assessment processes, including survivors of violence—including sexual or gender-based violence—children living with post-traumatic stress, anxiety, and depression, and children who experience intrusive thoughts, dissociation, flashbacks, and severe sleep disturbances.

Delayed Care Following a Negative Age Assessment

While some children receive an initial health assessment during their temporary emergency accommodation period, continuation of care is absent, even in those cases. Medical professionals who treat unaccompanied children in Marseille recounted several cases of children who were diagnosed with pathologies while in the temporary emergency accommodation (APU) period and then lost to follow-up entirely once they were denied recognition of minority and put back on the street.

Laporte told Human Rights Watch that once children leave ADDAP 13 facilities, they are harder to contact because they no longer have an address, and many do not have telephones or have changed numbers. As a result, children may not attend upcoming medical appointments or overlook test results that indicate a need for follow-up care:

Many kids who I am scheduled to see for a second visit, I will never see again if between the first time I see them and the following, their minority is rejected. We try to call them when there are important diseases [such as HIV, STIs, tuberculosis, or hepatitis] requiring treatment, but we often have trouble contacting them.

Untreated Diseases

R., a teenage boy from West Africa, arrived at ADDAP 13 in February 2021. While in the temporary emergency accommodation period, he was taken to the CLAT for a health screening and was diagnosed with tuberculosis. The CLAT shared the diagnostics with ADDAP 13 and requested that R. return to their facilities to be treated. Despite numerous reminders over several months from the CLAT to ADDAP 13, R. was never redirected to their services to receive treatment.

In April 2021, three months after the diagnosis, R. received a negative age assessment and was returned to the streets without any anti-tuberculosis treatment or follow-up care. After yet another phone call from the CLAT asking to see R. for treatment, ADDAP 13 explained that he was no longer housed in their facilities.

In November 2021, R. abruptly lost sensation in both of his legs. When he went to the hospital, doctors discovered that tuberculosis had spread to his bones and spinal cord. Doctors performed an emergency arthrodesis—a joint fusion—and inserted metal plates in his vertebrae. According to a volunteer, “He lost 60 percent of his mobility, and there are movements he will never simply be able to do again.”

The MSF nurse who handled R.’s case and follow-up care told us that had action been taken ten months earlier when he had his initial tuberculosis screening at the CLAT during the temporary emergency accommodation period, complications could have been avoided: “If they had treated the tuberculosis when it was diagnosed, he would maybe not have lost his mobility ... the fact that ADDAP 13 didn’t warn anyone about his condition is unacceptable.” Volunteers told us in May 2023 that R. continued to experience severe physical pain and difficulty climbing the stairs.

In another case, a West African teenage boy entered ADDAP 13 facilities on February 24 complaining that he was feeling ill. His case file shows that he tested positive for tuberculosis at the CLAT, but not until March 23, nearly one full month later, lawyers

told us.

A medical doctor treating unaccompanied migrant kids described the case of E., a teenage boy from West Africa who arrived in Marseille in 2021. After being turned away from ADDAP 13 and put on a waiting list for a spot in temporary emergency accommodation, he slept at the Saint-Charles railway station until he was placed with a host family through a volunteer-led association.

After two months, E. was finally granted temporary emergency accommodation with ADDAP 13 and underwent an initial health screening with the CLAT and CeGGID, diagnosing him with latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B. He received no treatment while in the temporary emergency accommodation period and was later put back on the street after receiving a negative age assessment without any rights to health care opened or any guidance regarding a treatment plan. It was only months later when MSF staff found E. that they discovered he had already been screened by the department and was carrying infectious diseases without any treatment.

A doctor who treated E. at a health center run by an association told us:

He had quite disturbing numbers on his labs, liver pain, a very high viral load … and he was completely in the wild, with no health insurance, nothing. It’s a miracle he came to see us. His liver was on the verge of shutting down. When you see a boy sleeping on the street—which we already know is harmful to vital health needs—with no access to care, and in the process of clearly destroying his health, and the department knew about it the whole time and did nothing … as a doctor, that truly traumatized me.

A nurse and other health professionals who spoke with Human Rights Watch commented that E.’s lack of access to treatment was not only dangerous for him, but it also posed a public health concern for the rest of the population.

Lawyers from the Unaccompanied Minors Commission of the Marseille Bar Association represented a young man who complained of severe knee pain. After an initial health assessment while in the period of temporary emergency accommodation, he was told he needed a biopsy. He later received a negative age assessment and was evicted from temporary emergency accommodation on the day of his scheduled procedure. In the absence of a reminder or accompaniment from an ADDAP 13 representative, he didn’t make it to his appointment. Months later, when he finally received medical care through an association, doctors found he had cancer in his knee.

MSF Marseille is aware of other serious cases of children with medical issues left untreated or for whom care was delayed, including sickle cell disease, liver cirrhosis, severe muscle and joint pain linked to beatings endured in Libya, bladder polyps caused by parasitic worms, and hepatitis B.

Delays in Accessing Education

All children in France are by law entitled to the right to education, regardless of their migration status. However, unaccompanied children in Marseille who were seeking review of adverse age assessments described lack of access to schooling and reported difficulties with enrollment.

Oumar N., a 16-year-old Guinean boy, told us, “I came here to France to go to school. It was my dream to study here, it would make me so happy.” Like Oumar, most children interviewed by Human Rights Watch expressed motivation to continue their education in France and study as a means of seeking a better future for themselves.

Enrollment Delays

To enroll in school, migrant children must take a placement test through the Academic Center for the Education of Newly Arrived Allophone Students and Children from Itinerant and Travelling Families (Centre Académique pour la Scolarisation des élèves allophones Nouvellement Arrivés et des enfants issus de familles itinérantes et de Voyageurs, or CASNAV) to determine their academic level. To register, children must fill out an online form in French, which often requires practical assistance.

Volunteers, lawyers, and children themselves told Human Rights Watch that the department does not help youth who are waiting for age assessments or appealing an adverse age determination with this process. Children must instead rely on the help of local associations for assistance with registration to take the CASNAV test.

Once children receive their test results, the education ministry is obligated to place them in a school. According to Stephan Laplanche, honorary president of the association Droit À l’École, “Access to education for these children is not at the ‘goodwill of the school’; all young people have a legal right to pursue education.”

Despite guarantees under the law, departments in France do not always allow unaccompanied youth to enroll in school, often arguing that classes are saturated and migrant children take spots away from French nationals. In some departments, the local education ministry even blocks access for unaccompanied migrant children to the public system and the private sector takes control of providing them with schooling.

In Marseille, the volunteer and citizen networks of RAMINA, Soutien 59 Saint-Just, and Collectif 113 have succeeded in persuading local public schools to enroll children who have no formal recognition of minority yet have record of a CASNAV placement test result. Nevertheless, there are significant delays with school placement given classes are at capacity.

Nearly all children with whom we spoke had waited months—or were still waiting—to be assigned to a school. According to a Collectif 13 volunteer helping children with their school enrollment paperwork, youth who are not recognized as children in Marseille lose on average six months of schooling due to delays:

If they arrive in February, the delays are so long that they likely can’t integrate into school until the following September. Even if they arrive in August, by the time they undergo the age assessment, find an association to help them, stabilize themselves, and are placed in a school, they will have lost many months of education.

(New York) – Indian authorities should urgently act to prevent further escalation in communal violence following the consecration of a controversial Hindu temple in Uttar Pradesh state on January 22, 2024, Human Rights Watch said today. Hindu processions that day led to sectarian clashes as well as incidents of vandalism, threats, and assault against Muslims and other religious minorities in several parts of the country.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who led the temple inauguration, had warned that those celebrating the temple should “show faith, not aggression.” However, as thousands of supporters of Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) joined cavalcades of vehicles across the country and shouted the slogan “Jai Shri Ram,” endorsing the god Ram, communal skirmishes broke out in a number of states including in Karnataka, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra , and Telangana.

“Prime Minister Modi’s explicit instructions against aggression often went unheeded, a casualty of violence emboldened by longstanding impunity, political patronage and protection,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Indian authorities need to take stronger action to end human rights abuses by Hindu militants.”

The most concerning incidents occurred in Maharashtra state, where a coalition government that includes the BJP took office in June 2022. In the Mira Road suburb of the state capital, Mumbai, arguments between Hindu men participating in a temple procession and Muslim residents soon flared into violence. The police arrested 13 men allegedly implicated in the violence.

Muslim witnesses said that in the evening before the temple inauguration, brawls broke out when Hindu mobs chanted slogans while brandishing sticks and swords in front of a mosque. When a militant Hindu mob returned to the same area on January 23, pelting stones and attacking shops, the police did little to control them. “The police are defending only one side,” Azeemuddin Sayed, a local social worker, told Human Rights Watch. “They should protect everyone. Or will they only protect based on religion?”

Abdul Haq Chaudhary said that the mob attacked his son and two workers, and damaged his vehicle. “They asked my son to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram,’ and when he refused, they started beating him,” Chaudhary said. He said that the mob attacked after they identified their vehicle as Muslim-owned as it had Islamic symbols. Chaudhary said he had filed a complaint, but the police had yet to make any arrests. “We have all the information. But the police are making excuses and saying they cannot spot anyone in the CCTV footage.”

After the Mira Road violence, the municipal authorities brought in bulldozers to demolish alleged illegal structures, most of them belonging to Muslims, that had been standing for decades. Local activists alleged that the government actions resulted in summary and collective punishment against Muslim residents.

Even as Prime Minister Modi declared on January 22 that the Ram temple was “a symbol of peace, patience, harmony and coordination in Indian society,” over a dozen instances of violent clashes were recorded across several Indian states. Many followed a similar pattern of young Hindu men displaying aggression, publicly brandishing sticks, swords, and in one case a gun. Violence did not escalate after the police intervened, showing that when ordered to do so, law enforcement can act in a rights-respecting manner, Human Rights Watch said.

A Muslim woman in Mumbai alleged that men chanting “Jai Shri Ram” harassed her on the streets. In Karnataka state, police arrested four men after a 17-year-old Dalit boy was assaulted and forced to say “Jai Shri Ram” for insulting Hindu gods because he had included a photo of the Dalit leader Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar on his WhatsApp status. Hindu mobs in Bihar celebrating the temple consecration allegedly set ablaze a Muslim cemetery.

In Uttar Pradesh, police arrested 11 people after the caretaker of a Mughal-era mosque in Agra complained that members of a Hindu procession forcibly placed saffron flags – symbolic of Hinduism – on the structure. In the state’s Sant Kabir Nagar district, police arrested five local residents who allegedly tried to enter a mosque twice while celebrating the temple consecration in a procession on January 22. In Telangana state, Muslim residents filed a police complaint after members of a Hindu procession allegedly threw shoes and papers at a mosque.

In some places, the violence followed confrontations between local Muslim and Hindu residents. In Gujarat, some threw stones when members of a Hindu procession lit firecrackers and played loud music in a Muslim neighborhood. In Telangana’s Sangareddy district, mobs set a shop on fire after an argument in which someone threw a shoe at the Hindu procession. In Panvel, Maharashtra, a scuffle ensued in a Muslim-dominated neighborhood after local residents confronted men chanting “Jai Shri Ram.” In Nagpur district, a brawl ensued between local Muslim residents and Hindu men celebrating the consecration. A communal clash in West Bengal on January 24 left at least 14 people injured.

The consecration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya is widely seen as a culmination of Hindu majoritarian and political demands led by the ruling BJP and its affiliates. The temple was constructed around the site where the 16th century Babri Mosque stood until a Hindu mob demolished it in 1992. Many Hindus believe that the mosque had been built on the ruins of a previous temple marking the birthplace of the Hindu god Ram. Thousands died in religious clashes and riots across the country following the demolition.

Secular and liberal groups in India organized screenings of documentaries during the temple inauguration to recall the brutalities that had marked the campaign for its construction. Both the authorities and Hindu groups targeted the screenings. In Hyderabad, three people were arrested after members of a Hindu group filed a complaint and allegedly vandalized the screening, accusing its organizers of “creating a communal issue.”

In Kerala, a Hindu mob threatened students of KR Narayanan National Institute of Visual Arts and Sciences, and disrupted the screening of the same documentary on the evening of January 22. In Pune, several men chanting slogans entered the Film and Television Institute of India to protest the screening of a documentary criticizing the Ram temple movement, vandalized the premises, and attacked students.

The authorities should act immediately to stem the deteriorating human rights situation in the country, particularly for freedoms of religion, expression, and association, Human Rights Watch said. Ahead of elections slated for this year, it is crucial to address rising fears of violence and discrimination against India’s Muslims and other religious minorities.

International attention has focused in recent weeks on the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague, as the United Nations’ highest judicial body heard South Africa ’s case alleging that Israel is violating the 1948 Genocide Convention in Gaza. While a decision on the merits will likely take years, on January 26 the court issued provisional measures that include requiring Israel to prevent genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.

The case is one of several human rights-based claims before the ICJ. One group looking on with great interest is Afghan women, both inside the country and in the diaspora.

The ICJ is mainly responsible for settling disputes between states over matters of international law. Some of its recent cases have concerned human rights. In November 2019, Gambia brought a case under the Genocide Convention against Myanmar regarding alleged genocide against ethnic Rohingya. In June 2023, the Netherlands and Canada filed a case against Syria alleging it is violating the UN Convention Against Torture.

Since taking power in Afghanistan in August 2021, the Taliban have imposed a brutal crackdown on women and girls, violating rights in every aspect of their lives, including their ability to study, work, live free from violence, access health care, participate in public life, move freely, or even just walk in the park. These abuses continue to escalate and are blatant violations of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which Afghanistan ratified in 2003. CEDAW allows states that are parties to the treaty to bring to the ICJ disputes with other states parties “concerning the interpretation or the application” of the convention not settled by negotiation or arbitration.

Many governments around the world have denounced the Taliban’s full-scale attack on the rights of women and girls. While the International Criminal Court is investigating Taliban atrocity crimes, the ICJ offers governments that have expressed their solidarity with Afghan women another practical way to put Taliban abuses under judicial scrutiny – one which, as illustrated in other recent cases, can produce measures that could have a positive impact.

Afghan women and girls deserve their day in court against the Taliban, and the ICJ could play an important role.

(Geneva) – The Sri Lankan government’s proposed law to create another body to investigate wartime abuses replicates previous failed efforts, ignores the needs of victims, and falls far short of meeting Sri Lanka’s international legal obligations, Human Rights Watch said today. Sri Lankan authorities continue to silence and repress families of victims and their communities 15 years after the armed conflict ended.

The Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation in Sri Lanka Bill was published on January 1, 2024, following limited consultations in 2023 and government pledges to investigate human rights violations and war crimes committed during the 1983-2009 civil war with the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and in its aftermath. It excludes widespread abuses committed during the left-wing Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) uprising of 1988-1990. Instead of providing truth, justice and redress, the proposed law appears designed to deflect international pressure over the lack of accountability for atrocity crimes and to persuade the United Nations Human Rights Council to end its scrutiny of Sri Lanka.

“A credible truth and justice process is desperately needed in Sri Lanka, where wartime abuses resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and enforced disappearances,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “However, the government’s continuing repression of victim communities and its protection of alleged perpetrators shows a lack of will to deliver justice, ensuring that this commission will fare no better than previous ones.”

The bill states that the new commission would produce a “truthful record” of violations committed during the war, make recommendations on reparations, and propose measures to prevent a recurrence. While the commission would also be able “to refer matters to the relevant law enforcement or prosecuting authorities … for further investigation and necessary action,” those authorities are already supposed to take up such cases, but routinely fail to do so. Successive Sri Lankan governments have blocked investigations, stalled trials, and silenced victims, in violation of international legal obligations to prosecute or extradite people responsible for serious crimes.

Since the 1990s, the government has created at least 10 similar commissions, at leave five of which have concluded reports. Many victims say they have “commission fatigue” and see no use in testifying again, risking re-traumatization and possible threats from the security forces with no expectation of justice and redress.

In 2023, after the government announced its plans to establish a new commission, numerous organizations representing conflict victims and civil society groups—especially in the most conflict-affected Northern and Eastern provinces—joined four separate joint statements rejecting the government’s approach and instead said it should act upon the work of previous commissions, while “building confidence” by ending ongoing abuses.

The current government, like its predecessors, has a record of making human rights pledges to deflect international pressure while continuing abuses and blocking meaningful reform and accountability. Many victims see the proposed commission as an attempt to persuade UN Human Rights Council member countries to end the council’s scrutiny, a view supported by statements from President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s office.

The proposed commission resembles the 2010-2011 Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission. After this commission failed to achieve its stated objectives, the Human Rights Council in 2015 passed the first of a series of important resolutions to advance accountability for atrocity crimes committed in Sri Lanka.

From 2015 to 2020, when Wickremesinghe was prime minister, the Human Rights Council adopted resolutions with the endorsement of Sri Lanka that envisaged a “hybrid” justice mechanism including both foreign and Sri Lankan staff. In 2021, after a new Sri Lankan government repudiated this process, the council established an international evidence-gathering project to support possible future prosecutions abroad.

Meanwhile, the current government has continued to repress fundamental rights. In January 2024, the government presented two bills in parliament that threaten the right to freedom of expression. According to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Anti-Terrorism Bill, to replace a law that has long been used to target minorities and perceived government opponents, “grants wide powers to the police – and to the military – to stop, question and search, and to arrest and detain people, with inadequate judicial oversight.”

The Online Safety Bill, adopted by parliament on January 24, “will give authorities unfettered discretion to label and restrict expressions they disagree with as ‘false statements,’” the high commissioner’s office said. New speech-related offenses carry lengthy prison terms.

The government has also continued to target those campaigning for truth and accountability. On January 5, the authorities arrested and detained Sivananthan Jenita and Meera Jasmine Charlesnise, who have campaigned for years seeking answers after the enforced disappearance of their relatives for protesting against President Wickremesinghe during his visit to the north. In December, nine ethnic Tamils were held under anti-terrorism legislation for commemorating war dead.

Government agencies continue to appropriate Hindu and Muslim religious sites and lands occupied by Tamil and Muslim communities on a variety of pretexts, in some cases to convert the sites into Buddhist temples or transfer them to members of the majority community. These actions violate the right to freedom of religion or belief and are in direct opposition to the government’s purported goals of promoting “reconciliation” and addressing the causes of conflict, Human Rights Watch said.

The new commission’s proposed mandate would overlap in ill-defined ways with existing but nonperforming agencies, including the Office of Reparations, established in 2018, and the Office of Missing Persons, established in 2017. On January 9, Sri Lanka’s parliament passed legislation to formalize yet another institution with an ostensibly similar purpose, the Office of National Unity and Reconciliation, which was created in 2015.

Concerned governments should decline to fund or endorse the new Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation, because it would not uphold Sri Lanka’s international obligations to address impunity or provide redress and does not have the support of victims and affected communities. Instead, they should work to ensure that the Human Rights Council mandate is renewed and enhanced to pursue accountability for past crimes and help end ongoing abuses.

“The actions of President Wickremesinghe’s government to silence dissent, protect and promote alleged rights abusers, and discriminate against minority communities give no grounds to believe that the latest ‘reconciliation’ plan will turn out differently from past commissions,” Ganguly said. “The government should start dealing with the past in good faith, by using the evidence already collected to advance accountability and stop persecuting victims and their families who demand justice.”",HIGH,20240129T061500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Meenakshi Ganguly (Human Rights Watch), President Ranil Wickremesinghe",Sri Lankan government,"Sri Lanka, particularly Northern and Eastern provinces","Decline to fund or endorse the new commission, push for genuine accountability and support for victim communities.",Proposed law fails to address wartime abuses and lacks accountability for atrocity crimes.,Sri Lanka,"Historical ethnic tensions, failure to implement previous reconciliation processes, ongoing repression of dissent"

Update: The Thai authorities ultimately allowed all seven Bi-2 band members to leave Thailand for Israel.

(Bangkok) – Members of the exiled Russian-Belarusian rock band Bi-2 face persecution for their public criticism of the Russian government if Thailand deports them to Russia, Human Rights Watch said today. Thai police arrested the seven band members for allegedly performing a concert without the proper work authorizations and later moved them to an immigration detention center pending deportation.

“The Thai authorities should immediately release the detained members of Bi-2 and allow them to go on their way,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Under no circumstances should they be deported to Russia, where they could face arrest or worse for their outspoken criticisms of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russia’s war in Ukraine.”

Bi-2’s seven members include Russian citizens as well as dual nationals of Russia and other countries, including Israel and Australia.

Bi-2 posted a Facebook statement on January 28, 2024, that Thai police had detained the group on January 24, shortly after they performed a concert in Phuket, in southern Thailand. The police alleged that the men did not have the correct legal permits to perform at a show in Thailand and seized their passports.

On January 25, after spending the night in a detention center in Phuket, the band members were put on trial. The court ordered them to pay a fine, which the group said they paid on the same day. The band stated in its Facebook post that during their members’ interactions with police and at the court, they were not provided with an interpreter, and they did not understand the Thai-language court documents related to their case.

The group members were then transferred from Phuket to an immigration detention center in Bangkok, where they are awaiting deportation to their respective countries of origin.

The Russian government views the group as a threat to national security. Following their detention in Thailand, Maria Zakharova, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said that the group had allegedly “sponsored terrorism” by condemning Russia and publicly supporting Ukraine.

In July 2022, a member of the Russian parliament accused the band members of “discrediting [the Russian] military” and called on the country's chief investigation agency to open a criminal investigation into their “anti-Russian stance” and “discreditation” attempts. In May 2023, Russia’s Justice Ministry designated the frontman of the band, Egor Bortnik (whose stage name is Leva), a “foreign agent” for “opposing the ‘special military operation’ in Ukraine, [and] making negative statements about Russia, its citizens and authorities.”

Bi-2 said in their statement that “outside [Russian] pressure played a significant role in our detention. We know that the reason for this pressure is [retaliation] for our creativity, our views, our position.”

It is not known if the Russian authorities have sought the band members’ forcible return to Russia. However, amid repression in Russia reaching new heights, Russian authorities have used transnational repression—abuses committed against nationals beyond a government’s jurisdiction—to target activists and government critics abroad with violence and other unlawful actions.

As a party to the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Thailand has an international legal obligation not to forcibly return anyone who would face the threat of torture if returned. In February 2023, Thailand’s Act on Prevention and Suppression of Torture and Enforced Disappearances codified this obligation in domestic law. The law stipulates that the authorities shall not “expel, return, or extradite a person to another State, if there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture, to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, or to enforced disappearance.”

The Thai government should not deport any of the band members to Russia. If forcibly returned, they would most likely face arbitrary arrest and detention, possible mistreatment in custody, politically motivated criminal charges, and unfair trials, Human Rights Watch said.

“There’s grave concern that the Russian authorities seek to punish these artists for speaking out against the Kremlin and criticizing Russia’s war against Ukraine,” Pearson said. “The Thai government should not permit the deportation of these activists to a place where they are likely to face persecution.”",HIGH,20240130T001500Z,Human Rights Watch,Egor Bortnik (Leva),Thai authorities and Russian government,"Phuket and Bangkok, Thailand",Do not deport band members to Russia,Persecution for public criticism of the Russian government,Thailand,"Political repression in Russia, criticism of the Russian government and war in Ukraine"

Saffron flags and posters of religious deities and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are dotting streets across India to mark the January 22 consecration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh state. However, public euphoria around the ceremony has also raised fears of violence and discrimination against India’s religious minorities, particularly Muslims.

The occasion is widely seen as a culmination of Hindu majoritarian and political demands led by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its affiliates. The temple was constructed around the site where the 16th century Babri Mosque stood until a Hindu mob demolished it in 1992. Many Hindus believe that the mosque had been built on the ruins of a previous temple marking the birthplace of the Hindu god Ram. Thousands died in religious clashes and riots across the country following the demolition, including deadly violence in Gujarat state in 2002.

While the authorities secured the area during the ceremony, Ayodhya’s Muslim residents expressed concerns for their safety. One group wrote to the police requesting law enforcement remain vigilant as devotees from throughout India visit the city over the coming weeks. Some have sent their families away from the city. Many Indian Muslims on social media have also cautioned against impending violence and have called for community members to avoid traveling by public transportation.

Hindu religious processions in India have turned violent when triumphalism transforms into provocation and violence. While the event passed peacefully, the previous day a group of men in Madhya Pradesh state shouted religious slogans, climbed atop a Christian church, and affixed a flag representing the new temple to the church’s cross.

Prime Minister Modi performed numerous pilgrimages and rituals ahead of the temple’s inauguration. Aware of global criticism of the BJP’s failure to protect religious minorities, he said that those celebrating the temple should “show faith, not aggression.”

However, while many businesses remained closed to join the celebrations, others stayed shut to prevent vandalism. BJP supporters committing violence in the past have often done so with impunity and been emboldened by political patronage.

On January 11, the United States and United Kingdom began carrying out airstrikes in Yemen in response to unlawful Houthi attacks on commercial shipping vessels in the Red Sea. As they enter this new chapter of armed conflict in Yemen, the US and UK still have not ensured accountability for possible violations of international humanitarian law and likely war crimes they and their partners have committed in the country for years.

The US began conducting “targeted killing operations” in Yemen in 2002 against Al-Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula (AQAP). The strikes continued until at least 2019, and killed many civilians, including 12 people attending a wedding in 2013. At the time, the US failed to acknowledge and investigate the civilian deaths in that attack.

The US and UK have also supported Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in their conflict with the Houthis in Yemen from 2015 until today. They have contributed billions of dollars’ worth of arms, as well as logistical support in training, that facilitated likely coalition war crimes and US/UK complicity in them.

The US government has obstructed investigations into weapons sales to Saudi Arabia, and the UK has continued to sell arms to Saudi Arabia despite those weapons being used by the coalition to carry out apparent violations of international humanitarian law and war crimes.

Meanwhile, western powers have consistently failed to adequately support local civil society and accountability and justice mechanisms that are a bedrock for long-term stability and maintaining adherence to international law. Neither the US nor UK has supported efforts to establish a new investigative mechanism at the United Nations Human Rights Council after the Group of Eminent Experts was disbanded in 2021 due to aggressive lobbying efforts by Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

By launching new strikes and expanding the conflict in Yemen without taking any meaningful steps to adequately support justice processes, the US and the UK have given Yemenis no reason to believe that this time around they’ll prioritize rights and international law.",HIGH,20240124T064500Z,Civil society and human rights organizations,"Unidentified civilians affected by airstrikes, victims of targeted killings","United States, United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates","Yemen, particularly Sanaa and Red Sea","Need for accountability, support for local justice mechanisms, cessation of arms sales to involved parties",Violations of international humanitarian law and complicity in war crimes,Yemen,"Escalation of conflict with Houthis, external military support"

It’s not called “Cancer Alley” for nothing.

The 85-mile stretch of the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, in the US state of Louisiana, got that name for a reason. Some 200 fossil fuel and petrochemical operations dominate the area, and they’ve wrecked the health of local residents.

The science of what’s happening here is clear. “The places where you have more industrial pollution, you have higher cancer rates,” says Kimberly Terrell, a research scientist from Tulane University who has investigated the area.

In fact, parts of Louisiana’s Cancer Alley have the highest risk of cancer from industrial air pollution in the United States.

And cancer is hardly the sole health problem linked to the area’s fossil fuel industries.

In a new HRW report, Cancer Alley residents describe not only cancer and its devastating impacts, but also elevated rates of maternal, reproductive, and newborn health, as well as respiratory ailments.

Entire communities have been devastated by cancer, the deaths of family and friends, missed days of work and school due to illness, and children rushed to emergency rooms suffering from asthma attacks. These harms are disproportionately borne by the area’s Black residents – many of whom have been organizing to fight back through public activism and legal action.

Sharon Lavigne, founder of RISE St. James, a faith-based environmental justice organization in Welcome, St. James Parish, in Louisiana’s Cancer Alley, explains in a new video that what industry is doing feels like a death sentence. “Like we are being cremated, but not getting burnt, but being polluted, dying from inhaling the industries going into our bodies, going through our nostrils.”

But she and many others in the area are unbowed: “There’s no place like home. I was born and raised here, and this is where I want to stay. The industry will have to go, not us. And we will not be a sacrifice for the industry.”

She’s right, of course. No one should have to die, no mother have to suffer, no child have to get sick, because of humanity’s need for energy. We know what’s causing the problem, and we know it’s fixable.

For decades, however, government agencies responsible for the protection of the environment and the wellbeing of citizens, haven’t been doing their job.

Louisiana’s regulatory authorities, particularly the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, have failed to address the severity of harm from fossil fuel and petrochemical industries and failed to enforce minimum standards set by the federal government. In short, they failed to protect people’s health.

The US Environmental Protection Agency shares the blame by not ensuring federal laws and mandates are enforced in the state of Louisiana.

People around the world often talk about the future dangers of climate change in general, global ways. That’s important, of course – essential, in fact. But we also need to understand how humanity’s addiction to burning fossil fuels, the largest driver of the climate crisis, impacts people in deadly ways in their local communities, on the ground and in the air, right now.

What's happening in Louisiana’s Cancer Alley is indeed like a sacrifice, a daily human sacrifice on the altar of our global fossil fuel cult.

Thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to brief the Council today on the dire human rights and humanitarian crises in Haiti.

This Council took an important step to address the crisis in Haiti last October, by authorizing the multinational security support force and highlighting many dimensions of the crisis that need to be addressed in a holistic way.

Unfortunately, deployment of the force and other critical components of a rights-based response have stalled, and the situation for many Haitians has only worsened.

Killings, kidnappings, sexual violence, and other abuses continue at a staggering rate, with criminal group activities and fighting intensifying and spreading.

Just in 2023, over 4,700 people were killed, doubling the figures reported in 2022, and almost 2,500 others were kidnapped. People we’ve interviewed in Haiti told us repeatedly about how they were struggling to feed their families, their children had constant stomach problems because they didn’t have access to clean water, and they couldn’t access health care or send their children to school.

Over 300,000 people are internally displaced, many of them forced to flee after their homes were burned down and sleeping in open air shelters with little or no humanitarian assistance.

Despite the efforts of leaders from the Caribbean Community, Haiti’s political deadlock persists. There is still no transitional government to meaningfully address the continuing challenges of corruption and complicity of senior political, economic and security actors that allow violent criminal groups to operate. And many Haitians lack access to basic rights and services, which fuels recruitment by criminal groups.

Some of the worst violence in recent months has been in Cité Soleil. A nurse Human Rights Watch interviewed this month, whom I’ll call Sandrine to protect her identity, described how her three-year-old daughter is so traumatized from the incessant gunshots in their Cité Soleil neighborhood in mid-November that she had diarrhea and vomited for three days while their community was under attack.

On the third day, gunmen tried to force their way into Sandrine’s home. Sandrine said that her small child was very aware of what was happening. “She asked me quietly, ‘are they going to kill us?’”

Sandrine said. “I told her that we are not going to die today.” Her daughter said, “If they enter, I will hide under a sheet and not make a sound,” and quietly asked her mother for a cloth so she could cover her mouth and vomit in silence.

Blocked by the barrier outside Sandrine’s home, the assailants eventually left, throwing a Molotov cocktail towards their house.

Two months later, Sandrine said her daughter is still very traumatized and unable to sleep. She holds her mother and says, “they’re hitting the barrier,” and she says to others, “they came to kill my mom.”

Sandrine said this was the worst moment of her life. She also stressed the urgency of an international response. She told us, in her words, “We really need it, as long as they are serious and provide real support, including in places like Cité Soleil. We are suffocating. Haitians are suffocating.”

It is voices like these that the Security Council heard and heeded when it chose to authorize an international force.

We’ve heard a similar sentiment from many Haitians we’ve interviewed. They’re well aware of the failures and abuses associated with past international interventions in Haiti – including widespread allegations of sexual abuse by peacekeepers and the unleashing of a cholera epidemic that killed some 10,000 people – but they also recognize that international support is needed now.

To avoid past failures, the Security Council should call on troop contributing countries and donors to implement a human rights due diligence policy that is at least as rigorous as that the UN applies to its peacekeeping missions.

This includes vetting members of the force before they are deployed and mitigating the risk that the force enables abusive units within the Haitian National Police. Individuals or units who are credibly implicated in serious human rights abuses should be ineligible.

The Council should reiterate zero tolerance for any misconduct by members of the international force and support independent oversight, with the involvement of Haitian civil society groups and impacted communities, to monitor and report on the force’s conduct and performance.

The Council should also support investigation of any allegations of abuse, including sexual exploitation, and ensure appropriate accountability.

But the security component should just be one part of a multi-faceted response to effectively address the human rights and humanitarian crisis in Haiti.

First, there remains an urgent need for well-coordinated humanitarian and development assistance.

Second, the Haitian people deserve a transitional government that can credibly work with international partners to restore security and the rule of law until free and fair elections can be organized.

Third, strong measures should be put in place to ensure justice and accountability for leaders of criminal groups and their backers.

Finally, targeted efforts are needed to curb the illicit flow of weapons and ammunition to criminal groups in Haiti.

We also call on the Council to remind all countries to stop returning Haitians who are fleeing this severe violence.

In a step forward for freedom of religion and belief in Indonesia, citizens from smaller religious groups are now permitted to change the religious identity on their identity cards, with the introduction of a new category, kepercayaan (belief), alongside the six recognized religions.

Kepercayaan has become the seventh religious category to join the list of government-recognized religions – joining Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism – since the nationwide blasphemy law went into effect in 1965.

Marubat Sitorus, the secretary general of the Parmalim association, a local religious group located around Lake Toba, Sumatra Island, said that about 95 percent of its members had changed their religious identity to the new category. Starting in December 2017, the Parmalim were the first group to start changing their religious identity on their cards.

The introduction of a seventh category began in September 2016 when four believers of local religions filed a petition at the Constitutional Court to change the 2004 Population Administrative Law. The plaintiffs included Nggay Mehang Tana of Sumba Island, a Marapu believer; Pagar Demanra Sirait of Toba Samosir in Sumatra, a Parmalim believer; Arnol Purba of Medan Belawan in Sumatra, an Ugamo Bangsa Batak believer; and Carlim of Brebes, Java Island, a Sapta Darma believer.

In October 2017, the Constitutional Court found in their favor, ruling that it is discriminatory not to recognize their faith and ordering the Civil Registration Office to print “penghayat kepercayaan” (practitioner of belief) in the appropriate slot on the ID cards’ rather than leaving it as a blank strip.

However, the Indonesian Ulama Council, an umbrella organization of Muslim groups, disagreed, contending that kepercayaan are different from “monotheistic religions,” and suggested the government provide two types of ID cards – for religion and for belief. After some negotiations, the government and the ulamas, Muslim clerics, compromised and added the sentence “Belief in the one God,” putting multiple small religions into a single category.

“This is a positive step even though it is not yet [fully] in accordance with the Constitutional Court's decision,” Sitorus told Human Rights Watch. “The pressure faced by the government, including individuals in the government itself, was immense.”

At least 138,000 Indonesians, from many religious groups, had chosen this new category nationwide, according to the Civil Registration Office. Now the government needs to move forward to end other forms of discrimination in government, society, and business against the adherents of these small, localized religions.",MEDIUM,20240122T181500Z,Marubat Sitorus,"Nggay Mehang Tana, Pagar Demanra Sirait, Arnol Purba, Carlim",Indonesian Ulama Council,Indonesia,"Government should end other forms of discrimination against adherents of small, localized religions.",Discrimination against practitioners of smaller religious groups,Indonesia,Historical discrimination against smaller religious groups

On January 25th, the United States state of Alabama plans to belt Kenneth Eugene Smith to a gurney, strap a respirator mask to his face, and force him to inhale pure nitrogen gas until he suffocates. This wholly untested method of execution raises the specter of torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.

Smith is scheduled to be the first human being in the US put to death using nitrogen gas. This method is not based on any scientific evidence. Instead, the state has based its brand-new procedures and protocols on speculation from accidental deaths by nitrogen. Veterinary scientists have ruled out the same method for euthanizing most mammals due to ethical concerns.

The execution scheduled for this week is not the first time the state of Alabama has attempted to kill Smith. In November 2022, Smith survived a botched execution by lethal injection, Alabama’s second failed execution in less than two months. Smith “was strapped down, couldn't catch [his] breath … was shaking like a leaf … absolutely alone in a room full of people … crying out for help.”

This new proposed method of execution continues the series of rights violations that have blighted Smith’s case. Smith’s first trial included prosecutors unconstitutionally removing Black jurors on the basis of race, and the second ended with a judge overriding the recommendation by eleven of twelve jurors that Smith should not receive a death sentence. Since his trial, the Alabama legislature ended this judicial override practice, so Smith faces execution based on a practice no longer permitted in any other state.

Nitrogen gas also presents a health hazard to those involved in Smith’s execution, including his spiritual advisor, whom the Alabama Department of Corrections required to sign a waiver acknowledging the risks of possible exposure to the gas.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for the cancellation of Smith’s execution, warning that the state’s intention to kill Smith in this manner could amount to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.

The death penalty is an attack on human dignity, is uniquely cruel in its finality, and is inevitably marked by discrimination, arbitrariness, and error, as evidenced yet again in Smith’s case. Alabama should not be subjecting Smith to this experimentation, the terrifying uncertainty, or the almost-certain suffering. Instead, it should abolish the use of the death penalty in all cases.",HIGH,20240123T223000Z,United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights,Kenneth Eugene Smith,State of Alabama,"United States Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana",Abolish the death penalty and halt the use of untested execution methods,Planned execution using an untested and potentially torturous method (nitrogen gas),United States,"Systemic issues in the judicial system, racial discrimination, and ethical concerns surrounding execution methods"

(New York) – Trinidad and Tobago should heed the renewed call by the United Nations’ top counterterrorism expert to bring home all its nationals detained in northeast Syria for alleged association with the Islamic State, Human Rights Watch said today. The UN made the expert’s findings public on December 18, 2023.

In July 2023, the UN expert, Fionnuala Ní Aoláin, visited locked camps and other detention centers in northeast Syria where United States-backed, regional forces are holding an estimated 90 Trinidadians, including at least 21 women and 56 children. The Trinidadians are among more than 55,000 Syrians and foreigners from dozens of countries, most of them children, detained in camps and prisons for alleged ISIS ties. Most have been detained since at least 2019.

“The government of Trinidad and Tobago should heed the UN expert’s appeal and immediately repatriate all of its nationals from Syria, most of whom are children who are victims of ISIS,” said Jo Becker, children’s rights advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. “Instead of dragging their feet, Trinidadian authorities should follow the example of dozens of countries that together have repatriated thousands of their nationals.”

During her visit to Roj camp in Syria, Ní Aoláin interviewed a Trinidadian mother detained there and the woman’s son, now 21, detained at a locked “rehabilitation” center for boys and young men. In a formal communication to the government of Trinidad and Tobago, Ní Aoláin expressed her “extreme concern” regarding the son’s “profound vulnerability in detention” and his “severe and evident state of trauma and suffering.” The woman told Ní Aoláin that her husband, the boy’s stepfather, took them to Syria when her son was 11. The son has been detained by regional authorities since he was 16 and has had very limited contact with his mother from that point on.

Since 2019, at least 39 governments have repatriated well over 8,000 of their nationals from the region. Trinidad and Tobago have repatriated none of their nationals.

In a December 18 response, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was “committed to returning its nationals from northeast Syria and is making the necessary legislative and regulatory arrangements” to facilitate repatriation. Many, if not most, of the countries that have repatriated their nationals have done so without special legislation.

In comments to the media on December 26, former Speaker of the House Nizam Mohammed, who chairs an advisory committee on repatriation created by Prime Minister Keith Rowley in March 2023, said the panel has not received resources or even responses from the government to its repatriation proposals. Committee members have “found ourselves in a dead-end position,” Mohammed said, calling the government’s response “most regrettable.”

Ní Aolaín, whose mandate as the UN special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism ended in November, has repeatedly said that governments have an obligation to “urgently repatriate” their nationals from northeast Syria, calling repatriation the “only human rights compliant response” to ending their unlawful, indefinite detention in dire conditions, with no due process. She reiterated in her October complaint to the government of Trinidad and Tobago that “return is an absolute imperative” and highlighted that conditions in Roj camp, where the Trinidadian mother Ní Aoláin interviewed was detained, amount to “cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.”

None of the detained Trinidadians have been charged with a crime or had access to a judge to challenge their detention. Most are children who were born in the detention camps or taken to Syria by their parents and never chose to live under ISIS.

In February 2023, Human Rights Watch published a report documenting the unlawful detention of Trinidadian nationals in life-threatening conditions in northeast Syria and urging the government of Trinidad and Tobago to bring them home.

“Every day that passes with no action by the government of Trinidad and Tobago adds to the suffering and despair of the Trinis detained in northeast Syria and their relatives who have been waiting for years for their return,” Becker said. “The government should not wait any longer and should take urgent steps to bring their nationals home.”",VERY HIGH,20240123T134500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Fionnuala Ní Aoláin, Jo Becker, Nizam Mohammed",Government of Trinidad and Tobago,Northeast Syria,"Urgent repatriation of nationals, legislative changes to facilitate repatriation.",Failure to repatriate nationals detained in northeast Syria,Trinidad and Tobago,"Alleged association with ISIS, complex geopolitical situation"

It is considered one of the largest prisons in the Middle East. The overwhelming majority of prisoners held in this detention facility are believed to have been convicted by courts on drug trafficking charges.

(Beirut) – Iranian authorities have recently escalated executions at an alarming rate, including those of Farhad Salimi and Mohammed Ghobadlou on January 23, with at least 11 people at imminent risk, many of them from minority communities, Human Rights Watch said today.

At least 11 prisoners face the death penalty on political or security-related charges that under international law should never result in the death penalty, a grave violation of the right to life. Prisoners at imminent risk were often convicted on vague charges, including moharebeh, or “enmity against God,” and “corruption on earth.” Other countries should put pressure on Iran to end the use of the death penalty for such charges.

“Iranian authorities are notorious for wielding the death penalty against people after unfair trials to instill fear into a population that has mobilized nationwide protests calling for fundamental reforms,” said Michael Page, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “Iran’s brutal government takes an especially harsh response to ethnic minority communities, including the 11 people at risk of imminent execution.”

According to Human Rights Activists in Iran (HRANA), a non-political and nongovernmental organization that defends human rights, at least 746 people were executed in Iran in 2023. This pattern has persisted in the new year, as the Kurdistan Human Rights Network (KHRN), an independent non-profit organization based in France, has reported on at least 34 executions so far since mid-December 2023. Most of these death sentences are related to charges involving drug offenses or “intentional murder.”

Eight of those on death row are Kurdish. Anwar Khezri, Kamran Sheikha, and Khosrow Besharat are in Ghezel Hesar Prison in Karaj and are facing execution, following the recent execution of their co-detainees, including Salimi, Ghasem Absteh, Ayoub Karimi, and Davood Abdollahi, in the past two and a half months. Khezri, Sheikha, and Besharat initiated a hunger strike on January 2 to protest Abdollahi's execution and the looming threat of their own death sentences.

According to the KHRN , these seven citizens were detained by security forces in the cities of Saqqez and Mahabad between December 2009 to February 2010 and were transferred to the Urumiyeh Intelligence Detention Center.

The KHRN says they underwent physical and psychological torture for several months there to extract forced confessions. The case went through various courts, leading to the confirmation of death sentences for all of them in February 2020 by Branch 41 of the Supreme Court.

Amnesty International reported that authorities forcibly disappeared four Iranian Kurdish dissidents—Pejman Fatehi, Vafa Azarbar, Mohammad (Hazhir) Faramarzi, and Mohsen Mazloum—after their arrests in July 2022. They also face a serious threat of secret execution without prior notification to their families or legal representatives. The death sentences of these men, handed down following an unfair secret trial, were affirmed by the Supreme Court on January 2, 2024, and are now set for implementation.

On January 16, Masoud Shamsnejad, the lawyer representing these prisoners, announced on his personal X (formerly Twitter) account that the request for a retrial for his clients in Iran’s Supreme Court had been rejected. He said that “the application has not been accepted due to the lack of inclusion of preliminary and final court documents. Generally, in security cases, the court documents are not provided to lawyers.”

On January 14, the families of the four detainees gathered in front of Evin Prison demanding the annulment of death sentences, the opportunity to meet with their children, and a public trial with the presence of lawyers and media.

Reza Rasaee, a Kurdish Iranian citizen and follower of the Yarsan faith, was arrested in Shahriar, Tehran during the nationwide protests of 2022 and later transferred to Dizel Abad Prison in Kermanshah. On October 7, 2023, Branch 2 of the Criminal Court in Kermanshah sentenced Rasaee to death on the charge of the murder of Nader Beyrami, the head of the Intelligence Organization of the Revolutionary Guards in the city of Sahneh.

According to HRANA, on November 18, 2022, during the ceremony commemorating the twenty-first anniversary of the death of Seyed Khalil Ali Nezhad, a former leader of the Yarsan community, the commemoration turned into a public protest. Security forces intervened, leading to casualties. Kermanshah's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps later confirmed Nader Beyrami's death during the gathering.

Two of those awaiting executions are Baluch. Haal Vash Human Rights Group, which focuses on human rights in the Baluchistan area, said that on November 12, 2023, Farshid Hasan Zehi, a Baluch resident who was arrested during the protests in Zahedan on November 24, 2022, was sentenced to execution following an unclear and non-transparent online court session, held without the presence of a lawyer.

He is currently in Ward 9 of Zahedan Prison. He was convicted of shooting at a vehicle near the police station in Cheshme Ziarat village, Zahedan, killing a soldier, Behzad Barahoui, and injuring First Lieutenant Mehdi Hashemzehi, a member of law enforcement. Haal Vash added that Hasan Zehi was compelled to make coerced confessions under torture.

Mansour Dehmardeh, a person with physical disabilities, was arrested in Zahedan on October 3, 2022. On January 3, 2023, he was sentenced to death on charges of “corruption on earth” by Branch 2 of the Criminal Court at the Shahid Nouri Judicial Complex in Zahedan. Haal Vash reported that during his 10-day detention, he suffered severe torture at the Intelligence Detention Center, resulting in a broken nose and teeth.

In March 2023, the Ahvaz Revolutionary Court sentenced Abbas (Mojahed) Kurkur, from Izeh, to death on charges of moharebeh (“enmity against God”) and “corruption on earth.” The Judiciary's Media Center alleged that Kurkur is implicated in the murder of Kian Pirfalak, a child who died during nationwide protests. However, Pirfalak's family, including his mother, denied that Kurkur had any involvement and instead said security forces killed her son.

Iranian authorities substantially increased the rates of executions in 2023. During the 2022 protests, judicial authorities drastically increased the use of vaguely defined national security charges that could carry the death penalty against protesters, including for allegedly injuring others and destroying public property.

A report published in April 2023 from Iran Human Rights, a human rights group based in Norway, revealed that ethnic minorities in Iran are disproportionately targeted in executions. The report notes that in 2022 alone, 130 people were executed in the provinces of West Azerbaijan, East Azerbaijan, Sistan and Baluchistan, and Kurdistan, a significant increase from 62 in 2021 and 60 in 2020. This underscores the intensified targeting of minority communities with capital punishment.

Update March 26, 2024: In a letter dated March 7, 2024, the Office of the President sent Human Rights Watch a letter outlining the steps his office has taken to ensure the rights of those facing the death penalty, including creating a dedicated email address whereby those sentenced to death, their families, or lawyers may request retrials; forming a committee with the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Interior, the Supreme Judicial Council, and the National Security Service to follow up on the release of those who have served their sentence or who have received a release order but have not yet been released; and preparing a draft Iraqi Penal Code which would reduce cases of death sentences.

(Beirut) – At least 150 prisoners at Iraq’s Nasiriyah prison face imminent execution without warning if President Abdul Latif Rashid approves their death sentences, Human Rights Watch said today. Thirteen men were executed in Nasiriyah prison on December 25, 2023, the first mass execution since 21 men were executed on November 16, 2020. Iraq should immediately declare a moratorium on all executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty.

“The renewal of mass executions in Iraq is an appalling development,” said Sarah Sanbar, Iraq researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The Iraqi government should immediately declare a moratorium on executions. These tremendous injustices are compounded by well-documented flaws in Iraq’s judicial system that deny defendants a fair trial.”

The December 25 executions were carried out without regard for the basic rights of those facing the death penalty, Human Rights Watch said. An inmate at Nasiriyah prison told his lawyer that on the evening of December 24, the names of the 13 men to be executed were called out on the prison’s loudspeaker. He said that the authorities collected them from their cells then executed them in the morning. They were not allowed to call their families or their lawyers before they were executed.

“It’s impossible for me to prevent executions of the victims that I am representing,” a lawyer who wished to remain anonymous and who represents several inmates in Nasiriyah prison told Human Rights Watch. “We do not know who will be targeted, for which case, for which reason, and when. I don’t even have access to my clients’ case files. I have been searching for months and calling every court in Iraq, but they all say they can’t give them to me.”

Multiple mass executions have taken place at Nasiriyah prison, the only prison in Iraq that carries out executions. They include two mass executions, of 41 and 38 people respectively, less than three months apart in 2017. Both executions and death sentences had been steadily decreasing since 2020, a trend that has now been reversed. About 8,000 prisoners, most charged with terrorism offenses, are believed to be on death row in Iraq. Iraqis refer to Nasiriyah prison as “al hout , ” or the whale, because it swallows people up and never spits them out, as people say.

These “secret executions,” as described in an Iraqi media outlet, are carried out without transparency or advance notice. They appear to be an attempt by the Iraqi authorities to resume executions in a manner that avoids the negative publicity and international condemnation that came with the last round of executions, Human Rights Watch said.

Iraq’s president is responsible for ratifying the death penalty decrees he receives from the Supreme Judicial Council, after which the executions are carried out. In a September 2023 statement, Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said that President Rashid should ratify all death penalty sentences for drug charges. The previous president, Barham Salih, opposed the death penalty and resisted ratifying death sentences, but political pressure and public anger over terrorist attacks led him to ratify them.

Two of the men executed on December 25 were convicted for the murder of a narcotraffic police officer.

“Without transparency, detainees and their families don’t know if their sentences have been ratified or not,” the lawyer said. “Some detainees know their sentences were ratified years ago, afraid that any day their name could be called over the loudspeaker.”

Sweeping application of the death penalty is of particular concern given serious flaws in Iraq’s judicial system, particularly in terrorism trials, that deny defendants the right to a fair trial. Human Rights Watch opposes the death penalty in all circumstances because of its inherent cruelty and irreversibility.

Terrorism trials in Iraq have generally been rushed, based on a defendants’ confessions—often obtained under torture—and have not involved victim participation. The authorities have systematically violated the due process rights of suspects, such as guarantees in Iraqi law that detainees will see a judge within 24 hours, will have access to a lawyer throughout interrogations, and that their families will be notified and should be able to communicate with them during detention.

If the defendant’s fair trial guarantees have been violated, imposition of the death penalty would make the sentence arbitrary.

Courts in Iraq regularly rely on uncorroborated confessions and ignore allegations that these confessions were obtained under torture. In line with international legal standards and Iraqi criminal procedures, Iraq’s judges should investigate all credible allegations of torture and the security forces responsible, and transfer detainees to different facilities immediately after they allege torture or ill-treatment to protect them from retaliation.

The government should reiterate to judges that they are obligated to dismiss any evidence obtained by torture. Judicial authorities should investigate and determine who was responsible for any torture, punish abusive officers, and compensate the victim.

Iraqi judges have sentenced defendants to death on the overbroad charge of mere “membership of a terrorist organization,” without reference to any acts of violence. Under international law, application of the death penalty is strictly limited to the “most serious crimes,” meaning intentional killing, or murder.

A man whose surname is al-Dulaimy told Human Rights Watch that his three brothers were sentenced to death under Iraq’s counterterrorism law and have been imprisoned in Nasiriyah prison since 2015. He said that his brothers were unjustly accused of terrorism after his family refused a militia’s extortion attempts to provide it with partnership in his family’s construction firm.

Dulaimy said his brothers have experienced torture and other ill-treatment. His mother and his brothers’ wives are only allowed to visit every six months and face brutality from prison guards on each visit. “During the last visit, a prison guard beat my nephew, who is 10 years old,” Dulaimy said. “My brothers told my mother they were tortured, forced to sign confessions, psychologically tormented, and fed poor food. Guards made them stand naked in the open air as a form of punishment.”

Dulaimy said his family has spent years trying to get a medical report to prove his brothers’ accounts of torture to no avail. “They wouldn’t give us the report,” he said. “They just passed us from one court to another.”

In light of rising executions, Dulaimy fears for his brothers’ lives. “It could happen any time,” he said. “We just don’t know. They don’t share information with us.”

Nasiriyah prison is also notorious for its dire conditions. Human Rights Watch is aware of at least 96 deaths of Nasiriyah inmates since 2021, 18 of them within a four-week span in 2021. Many of these deaths occur in suspicious circumstances; bodies show evidence of torture, and families have been denied access to autopsy reports.

“For years, Iraq had one of the highest rates of executions in the world,” Sanbar said. “It is deeply troubling to see the country revert to the death penalty instead of making meaningful reforms in the judiciary that would ensure fair trials.”",VERY HIGH,20240124T081500Z,Human Rights Watch,"President Abdul Latif Rashid, Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, lawyer representing inmates, al-Dulaimy family",Iraqi government,"Nasiriyah prison, Iraq","Moratorium on executions, judicial reforms for fair trials, investigation of torture allegations.",Imminent executions without fair trials and due process violations,Iraq,"Political pressure, public anger over terrorism, systemic flaws in judicial processes"

The Nigerian government should adopt and act on recommendations made by member states at the United Nations Human Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review (UPR) process earlier this week.

The recommendations, made on January 23, cover a range of concerns, including the death penalty, lack of justice and accountability for abuses by government security forces and other actors, women’s political participation, sexual and gender-based violence, child marriage, and rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people.

The UPR is a peer-review process in which UN member states assess each other’s human rights records and recommend changes to comply with international standards. Human Rights Watch contributed recommendations for states before the review. This is Nigeria’s fourth UPR.

Many states brought up the long-standing problem of impunity for security force abuses. The United States, a key security partner, called on Nigeria’s government to amend law enforcement procedures to ensure rights are protected and to establish a panel to investigate police brutality against protesters in 2020. The United Kingdom called on Nigeria’s government to protect civilians in armed conflict, investigate violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, and ensure accountability for abuses by security forces.

Dozens of member states called for Nigeria’s immediate moratorium on the death penalty and for its eventual abolition, as well as greater women’s inclusion and participation in government access to justice for sexual and gender-based offenses. On LGBT rights, member states called for the repeal of Nigeria’s 2013 Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Law criminalizing same-sex relations, the release of people detained based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, and for ending prosecutions on these grounds.

The Nigerian government’s delegation at the review session, led by Nigeria’s Minister of Justice and Attorney General Lateef Fagbemi, expressed Nigeria’s commitment to human rights and to the UPR process while highlighting several policies, including the 2022-2026 National Action Plan to Protect Human Rights, adopted to address various rights concerns since Nigeria’s 2018 UPR.

War crimes prosecutions remained slow, inefficient, and marred by delays. Attacks and threats against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people and organizations continued. Serbia and Kosovo signed a joint declaration on missing persons in May as part of an EU-brokered normalization process, but relations deteriorated after clashes in northern Kosovo later that month linked to a contested election.

Freedom of Media

Independent journalists remain under pressure with an inadequate state response.

In the first half of the year, the Permanent Group for the Safety of Journalists registered 42 cases of threats against journalists and the Independent Journalists’ Association recorded three attacks by the end of March.

In March, Stevan Dojcinovic, investigative journalist and editor of the independent news portal KRIK, received a death threat on TikTok after a podcast where he mentioned that the price for contract killings had dropped drastically. Authorities were investigating at time of writing.

During a Belgrade protest in March denouncing the European Union’s plan for the normalization of relations between Serbia and Kosovo, FoNet news agency reporter Marko Dragoslavić was forcibly hooded and punched in the face when leaving the protest. Dragoslavić reported the attack to the police and the case was under investigation at time of writing.

Journalists remained a target of so-called strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPP).

In May, the High Court in Belgrade ruled against KRIK for publishing an article in 2021 listing those who had sued the outlet for defamation, including a police chief and two employees from the Police Unit for Witness Protection. The court ordered the removal of the article and awarded 374,200 Serbian dinars (about US$3,643) in damages to the plaintiffs. KRIK has appealed the decision. By May, KRIK was the target of 12 defamation lawsuits.

In September, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Serbia violated TV channel B92’s freedom of expression when the assistant health minister sued the station over reports alleging she had abused her office in the procurement process for swine flu vaccines. The court held that the B92 had acted in “good faith and with the diligence expected of responsible journalism.”

In March, the retrial of Ratko Romić and Milan Radonjić, two Serbian state security officers accused of participating in the 1999 murder of journalist Slavko Ćuruvija, started. In April, the Belgrade Appeals Court released the suspects from house arrest, following a European Court of Human Rights decision in early April stating that Serbia had violated their rights by holding them in custody for too long.

Pro-government media continued smear campaigns against independent journalists reporting critically on the government.

Accountability for War Crimes

Between January and August, the War Crimes Prosecutor’s Office launched three new war crimes investigations involving seven suspects. As of August, 24 cases against 41 defendants were pending before Serbian courts. Ongoing proceedings were marred by significant delays.

In February, following a retrial, the Belgrade High Court found former Bosnian Serb soldier Dalibor Krstović guilty of crimes against civilians, including rape in Kalinovik, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), in August 1992, and sentenced Krstović to nine years’ imprisonment.

In April, the trial against Lazar Murlak, a former Bosnian Serb wartime reserve police officer and member of the Sprsko Gorazde Territorial Defence, started at the Belgrade High Court. Murlak is charged with rape of a Bosniak woman in 1992 in Lozje, BiH.

In February, the Belgrade High Court sentenced four Serbian former fighters to a total of 35 years in prison for participating in the 1993 abduction in Strpci, BiH, of 20 non-Serb train passengers, who were subsequently killed.

In July, the Appeals Court in Belgrade ordered a retrial and overturned the November 2022 conviction of Bosnian Serb Danko Vladičić for the killing of an older man and woman in Brod na Drini, BiH, in 1992.

In May, the UN International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals in The Hague increased the prison sentences of former head of Serbian state security, Jovica Stanišić, and his deputy, Franko Simatović, from 12 to 15 years. They were convicted for their role in forcibly removing non-Serbs from parts of BiH and Croatia in 1992 and 1995 as well as murders, deportation, inhumane acts, and persecution.

Refugees, Asylum Seekers, and Migrants

Between January and September, 1,257 new arrivals registered their intent to seek asylum, but only 150 people lodged asylum applications.

The asylum system remained flawed, with asylum seekers facing difficulties in accessing procedures, low recognition rates, and long delays. Between January and September, Serbia granted refugee status to six people and subsidiary protection to two. Between late February 2022 and late October 2023, Serbia granted temporary protection to 1,387 people, almost exclusively from Ukraine.

By the end of August, 109 unaccompanied migrant children were registered with Serbian authorities. Serbia lacks formal age assessment procedures for unaccompanied children, putting older children at risk of being treated as adults instead of receiving special protection.

In July, the European Court of Human Rights found that Serbia had violated the freedom of movement of a Syrian national to whom Serbia had granted asylum and then denied access to refugee travel documents.

Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity

LGBT people continued to face intolerance, threats, and violence. Between January and September, a domestic LGBT+ support group, Da Se Zna!, recorded 32 incidents of hate-motivated incidents against LGBT people, including seven physical attacks and five threats. In August, President Aleksandar Vučić said that as long as he is president, he will not sign any law recognizing a third gender or same-sex marriage.

In February, unknown assailants attacked three LGBT people in central Belgrade. One victim was stabbed with a knife, and the other two were injured by a broken bottle. The following night, another was injured by security guards at a club.

In May, an unknown person vandalized the Belgrade Pride Info Center by throwing red paint at the Center’s window and the Belgrade Pride logo. It was the 18th attack on the center since 2018.

Women’s and Girls’ Rights

A September report by Council of Europe Human Rights Commissioner Dunja Mijatovic raised serious concerns about the high prevalence of domestic violence and stressed the need for a coordinated institutional response to protect women and girls from violence and provide immediate and long-term support to survivors.

Disability Rights

Children with disabilities continue to be overrepresented in institutional care. Nearly 75 percent of children in institutions in Serbia are children with disabilities. Despite a legal ban, children under the age of 3 continue to be placed in institutional care, including due to socioeconomic reasons, according to UNICEF. In three out of six institutions for children with disabilities across the country, children with disabilities live with unrelated adults, putting them at a potentially greater risk of violence and abuse.

Almost 30 percent of children with disabilities who live in institutions are not enrolled in school; those who are enrolled attend segregated special schools for children with disabilities.

The number of adults with disabilities living in institutions in Serbia increased compared to previous years. The government continues to invest in institutional care for such adults, including by expanding existing institutions, while support in communities remains limited.

Key International Actors

In March, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Representative on Freedom of the Media Teresa Ribeiro and Head of the OSCE Mission to Serbia Jan Braathu expressed concerns about the targeting of journalists in Serbia and urged authorities to thoroughly investigate all incidents and hold perpetrators accountable for violence and threats.

Council of Europe Human Rights Commissioner Dunja Mijatovic in March called on Serbia to increase safety for journalists and to protect women from violence.

The November EU Commission enlargement report on Serbia said that while authorities had started to implement key judicial reforms, more work and political commitment are needed to implement comprehensive rule of law reforms. The Commission remained concerned about media freedom, noting the continuation of threats, intimidation, hate speech, and violence against journalists and an increase in SLAPPs by members of national and local authorities.

Kosovo

Accountability for serious crimes and media freedom continue to be pressing concerns.

Tensions flared up in the north in May when ethnic Albanian mayors took office in municipalities following local elections that were largely boycotted by the ethnic Serb majority. Ensuing protests resulted in NATO forces clashing with protesting ethnic Serbs in the north, injuring at least 50 Serbs and 25 NATO soldiers. In September, a Kosovo police officer was killed by a group of heavily armed Serb gunmen in Banjska who then took shelter inside an Orthodox church. Kosovo security forces shot three of the group dead and arrested at least eight others, and Serbia increased military deployments at its border with Kosovo.

The United Nations failed to apologize and pay individual compensation to Roma, Ashkali, and Balkan Egyptian victims of lead poisoning in contaminated camps for displaced people run by the UN Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) in 1999. A 2016 report by the Human Rights Advisory Panel (HRAP), an independent body established to investigate complaints of abuses by UNMIK, found that the UN should pay individual compensation and apologize to victims.

Accountability for War Crimes

In April, the trial of former Kosovo President and Prime Minister Hashim Thaci and three other former senior Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) officials began in The Hague before the Kosovo Specialist Chambers. The accused, who spent almost 2.5 years in pretrial detention, are charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity allegedly committed in 1998 and 1999. All four men pled not guilty.

In December 2022, the Specialist Chambers sentenced KLA commander Saljih Mustafa to 26 years in prison for war crimes and ordered him to pay €207,000 in reparations to victims. His case was under appeal at time of writing. In February, the Specialist Chambers began the trial of KLA member Pjeter Shala, who is accused of abusing detainees at a metal factory in Kukes, northern Albania, in 1999. Also in February, appeals judges upheld a May 2022 verdict on all but one charge against two members of the KLA War Veterans Association, Hysni Gucati and Nasim Haradinaj, over revealing the names of potential witnesses in the Thaci et al. trial, reducing their prison sentences of 4.5 years by 3 months. In August, former KLA member Dritan Goxhaj was arrested in Tirana, Albania, for revealing the names of five potential witnesses testifying before the Specialist Chambers. Goxhaj was awaiting extradition to the Netherlands at time of writing.

In June, in a retrial, the basic court in Prizren convicted former KLA fighter Remzi Shala of the 1998 kidnapping of a suspected ethnic Albanian collaborator and sentenced him to 9.5 years in prison.

In July, Kosovo’s Special Prosecution filed two separate indictments regarding war crimes. The first indictment charged a former member of the Serbian armed forces with expelling ethnic Albanians and looting and burning their property during the 1998-1999 war. The second charged a former member of the Serbian armed forces with crimes against humanity for his involvement in murder, raids, beatings, mistreatment, torture, and the deportation of thousands of ethnic Albanians from Reznik during the war.

In June, Kosovo’s Special Prosecution charged a former Serbian policeman with war crimes against civilians for his participation in the May 1999 shooting of 19 ethnic Albanians in the village of Ozdrim.

Freedom of Media

Journalists continued to be subjected to physical attacks, threats, and obstructions in their work. Between January and September 2023, the Association of Journalists of Kosovo (AGK), recorded 60 incidents against journalists, including 16 attacks and 22 threats.

In early June, AGK recorded six separate attacks by protesters on ethnic Albanian journalists on the same day in the ethnic Serb majority town Leposavic in north Kosovo. The journalists were in Leposavic to report on increased tensions and protests by ethnic Serbs following local municipal elections in the north in May. One journalist suffered a broken arm and others were hit by stones to the head and legs. Police were investigating the attacks at time of writing.

In May, journalist Burim Zarici was attacked in Zvecan while filming an attack on a Kosovo Police car. The perpetrator was convicted.

Also in May, RTV21 cameraman Berat Bahtiri and journalist Lirie Dibrani were attacked by protesters in North Mitrovica while covering tensions between Kosovo Serbs and Albanians in the north. Bahtiri lost his equipment. Police were investigating the case at time of writing.

In March, RTV editor and journalist Alban Selimi’s garage was set on fire. A suspect was arrested, tried, and convicted of arson. Selimi believes the attack is linked to a 2021 story he wrote alleging the perpetrator’s relatives were involved in usurping land.

Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity

Threats and acts of discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people (LGBT) continue. According to the local LGBT organization CEL, many LGBT people faced threats, intimidation, and violence from family members in 2023, with poor responses from state authorities when they reported any abuse. CEL itself regularly receives threats and hateful comments on its social media accounts.

Women’s and Girls’ Rights

The government in January decided to extend the deadline for survivors of sexual violence during the Kosovo war to register and receive special welfare benefits. The special commission to recognize and verify such survivors was set up in 2018 and was set to finish registrations in February. Of an estimated 20,000 wartime rape victims, fewer than 2,000 have applied to the commission.

The Kosovo Agency of Statistics showed that only 20 percent of women participated in the labor force and called for more reforms for women to contribute toward the economy and prosperity.

Survivors of domestic violence continue to face obstacles accessing justice and support when leaving abusive environments.

Asylum Seekers and Displaced Persons

Between January and August, the Kosovo Ministry of Internal Affairs registered 292 forced returns to Kosovo, the majority from Germany. Sixteen were children. Of those forcibly returned, nine were Roma, two Ashkali, one Serb, and rest ethnic Albanian. During the same reporting period, the ministry registered 28 voluntary returns to Kosovo. The ministry claimed to have no data on the ethnicity of those who voluntarily returned. By mid-August, Kosovo had registered six asylum seekers from Ukraine.

Accountability of International Institutions

In a July report, the UN special rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence recommended that the UN provide full and effective reparations, including a fully funded reparation program, to Roma, Ashkali, and Balkan Egyptian victims of lead poisoning who had resided in contaminated camps for displaced people run by UNMIK. A 2016 report by the Human Rights Advisory Panel (HRAP), an independent body established to investigate complaints of abuses by UNMIK, recommended the UN pay individual compensation and apologize to victims. The UN has yet to comply with the recommendations at time of writing.

Key International Actors

Concluding that Kosovo had failed to reduce tensions in the north, as asked on June 3 by 27 European Union member states, the EU implemented a range of punitive measures later that month. These included Kosovo’s exclusion from high-level meetings and the suspension until 2024 of pre-accession funds to Kosovo. At time of writing, the measures were still in place.

In May, the United States Ambassador called on Prime Minister Albin Kurti to take concrete steps to de-escalate the situation in the north.

The November European Commission’s enlargement report on Kosovo said that while some legislative achievements were made, more needed to be done on justice reforms and the rule of law, stressing the strengthening of the integrity, accountability, independence, and efficiency of the justice system. The Commission also noted the lack of progress on freedom of expression and remained concerned about physical attacks and threats against journalists, public smear campaigns, and hate speech.",HIGH,20240126T230000Z,Independent Journalists and LGBT organizations,"Stevan Dojcinovic, Marko Dragoslavić, Dalibor Krstović",Serbian Government and associated entities,Serbia,"Strengthen protections for journalists and LGBT individuals, implement reforms ensuring accountability and support for victims.","Violations of media freedom and LGBT rights through threats, violence, and insufficient legal protections",Serbia,Political climate that fosters hostility towards independent journalism and LGBT communities

(The Hague) – The International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered provisional measures on January 26, 2024, in South Africa’s case alleging that Israel is violating the Genocide Convention, Human Rights Watch said today. The court adopted “provisional measures,” or binding orders, that include requiring Israel to prevent genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, enable the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance, and prevent and punish incitement to commit genocide.

The ICJ held hearings on January 11 and 12 to consider South Africa’s request for provisional measures, which featured the first formal response by Israel before an independent and impartial court to allegations of atrocities against the Palestinian people since October 7, 2023. On December 29, 2023, South Africa had filed a case with the court alleging that Israel is violating the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.

“The World Court’s landmark decision puts Israel and its allies on notice that immediate action is needed to prevent genocide and further atrocities against Palestinians in Gaza,” said Balkees Jarrah, associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch. “Lives hang in the balance, and governments need to urgently use their leverage to ensure that the order is enforced. The scale and gravity of civilian suffering in Gaza driven by Israeli war crimes demands nothing less.”

The ICJ concluded it was necessary to indicate certain measures “in order to protect the rights claimed by South Africa that the Court has found to be plausible,” including “the right of the Palestinians in Gaza to be protected from acts of genocide.” The court’s order also requires Israel to prevent the destruction and ensure the preservation of evidence related to the case, as well as to report on the implementation of the measures ordered within one month.

The order is legally binding on the parties. Although South Africa had requested certain other measures in their application, the court’s rules allow the judges to determine what measures to order. The provisional measures order will be automatically sent to the UN Security Council.

The case before the ICJ is not a criminal case against individual alleged perpetrators and it does not involve the International Criminal Court (ICC), a separate body. Rather, the case is “state-to-state” litigation between UN member states governed by legal provisions in the UN Charter, the ICJ Statute, and the Genocide Convention.

ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan recently confirmed that his office has since March 2021 been conducting an investigation into alleged atrocity crimes committed in Gaza and the West Bank since 2014, and that his office has jurisdiction over crimes in the current hostilities between Israel and Palestinian armed groups that covers unlawful conduct by all parties.

“The ICJ’s speedy ruling is recognition of the dire situation in Gaza, where civilians face starvation and are being killed daily at levels unprecedented in the recent history of Israel and Palestine,” Jarrah said. “The court’s clear and binding order raises the stakes for Israel’s allies to back up their stated commitment to a global rules-based order by helping ensure compliance with this watershed ruling.”",VERY HIGH,20240126T171500Z,South Africa,Balkees Jarrah,Israel,Gaza,Governments to use leverage to ensure ICJ order enforcement,Violating the Genocide Convention,Israel,"Allegations of Israeli war crimes, ongoing conflict"

Dear Foreign Secretary,

Re: Ongoing Negotiations between the UK and Mauritian Governments on the exercise of sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago

We write regarding the continuing negotiations between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of Mauritius over the sovereignty of the Chagos Islands. As Human Rights Watch has made clear, it is critical that the rights of the Indigenous Chagossian people are centred, including their meaningful participation in the outcome of these negotiations and future governance of the islands, and that the UK Government immediately ends the ongoing crimes against humanity which it continues to commit against the Chagossian people, namely the displacement from their homeland and the continued denial of their right to return.

Any agreement with Mauritius must specifically provide for full reparations, including the right of return for all Chagossians to live in their homeland, including Diego Garcia, and full compensation, all based on meaningful consultations with the Chagossian people.

Ongoing Colonial Crimes

As established in our recent report, Human Rights Watch found three ongoing crimes against humanity which have been committed against the Chagossian people:

The forced displacement of the entire Chagossian people from every island of the archipelago by the UK and US. The prevention of the Chagossians from returning to live in their homeland, including the island of Diego Garcia. Persecution of the Chagossians on the grounds of race and ethnicity – shown in part by the different standards applied to other islanders living near military bases, such as in Cyprus and the Falkland Islands and the attempts to deny the application of international human rights law and criminal law in the Chagos Islands.

Accordingly, states and individuals who have and continue to contribute to these crimes, including those who contribute to preventing the return of Chagossians to live in their homeland, including on Diego Garcia, will share responsibility for crimes against humanity. This responsibility will include those who order, assist or instigate the crimes, including in or after any agreement reached between the UK and Mauritius. Responsibility will also include those who currently have, or obtain in the future, legal or factual control over the Chagos Islands or part of them and help prevent the return of the Chagossians.

We took note of your evidence to the Foreign Affairs Committee on January 9, 2024, and were extremely concerned that you failed to even mention the rights of the Chagossians when discussing the future of the Chagos Islands, suggesting that return to any island was ‘not possible’, instead claiming that the overriding question must be the safety, security and useability of the base on Diego Garcia. We note that your predecessor acknowledged that resettlement of the Chagossians in their homeland was part of the negotiations with Mauritius.

It should be noted that Chagossian groups are not advocating for the closure of the military base on Diego Garcia but wish to return to live on the unoccupied islands and the unoccupied part of Diego Garcia.

In addition, continuing to deny the Chagossians the protection of international human rights law and international criminal law by denying its application to the territory of Chagos may contribute to the crime against humanity of persecution on the grounds of race.

Reparations

The UK and US inflicted harm on the Chagossian people and they owe them reparations under international law. These standards (as set out, for example, in the UN Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation), include three key elements.

First, ensuring that every Chagossian, of every generation and citizenship, may return to live, in dignity, in all the Chagos Islands, including Diego Garcia. This means the UK should immediately lift every legal barrier, and the US should publicly declare its supports for the return of Chagossians, including to Diego Garcia. Mauritius, should they gain sovereignty over some or all of the islands, should also publicly guarantee this right for every Chagossian, regardless of citizenship. As part of restitution, the UK and US should restore the Chagos Islands, so that the Chagossians can return to live permanently in dignity and prosperity, at a minimum standard equivalent to how they would live today had they not been expelled over 50 years ago.

The second element of reparations is full and adequate financial compensation to all Chagossians for all the harms caused to them since 1965.

The third element of reparations is satisfaction and guarantees that such crimes will not happen again. This includes, as Chagossians have requested, meaningful apologies, including from King Charles and the UK Government. The UK and US Governments have ‘regretted’ the manner of the Chagossians’ removal. This is not enough. There should be an explicit apology, and this should be coupled with accountability for these crimes against humanity, like other crimes.

Like all reparations, all the above needs to be agreed and implemented by all the governments concerned through meaningful consultations with the Chagossians. The Chagossians are the Indigenous people of the Chagos Islands and should be recognised as such. Their right to return, the restoration of their islands and the financial compensation need to be agreed and implemented with them.

We ask for an opportunity to meet with you to discuss this issue at your earliest convenience.

Yours sincerely,

Yasmine Ahmed

Mali's junta announced yesterday the end of a 2015 peace agreement with armed separatist groups. Should fighting intensify, it’s critical that the warring parties abide by international humanitarian law—the laws of war—and protect civilians against dangers arising from military operations.

In a statement read on national television, Col. Abdoulaye Maïga, spokesperson for the Malian military government, ascertained the “absolute inapplicability” of the peace agreement due to other signatories’ “change of posture,” the commission of “terrorist acts,” as well as “hostile acts” by the government of Algeria, the deal’s main broker, which Malian authorities accuse of hosting suspected “terrorists.”

In June 2015, the Malian government and a coalition of mainly ethnic Tuareg armed groups from northern Mali, called the Coordination of Azawad Movements (Coordination des mouvements de l’Azawad, CMA), signed a United Nations-brokered agreement to restore peace in the country, following three years of fighting. The deal came after Tuareg rebels launched a violent independence campaign in 2012 against Mali’s government, accusing it of marginalizing their region, which they call Azawad, and calling for greater autonomy.

The deal began to fray in August 2023 as hostilities renewed between the rebels and the Malian armed forces, who were assisted by fighters from the Wagner Group , the Russia-linked military security contractor, in the country’s north. This fighting culminated in December with the announcement that the government had regained control of the northern town of Kidal, a stronghold of the Tuareg rebellion. Media reported that civilians, including children, were killed in military drone strikes on Kidal that forced more than 11,500 people from their homes.

Residents have told Human Rights Watch of their fear of being caught between the two sides.

In recent months there has been a surge in attacks by armed Islamist groups across Mali. As UN peacekeepers, deployed to the country in 2013, complete their withdrawal at the request of the junta, there are serious concerns for rights monitoring and accountability for security force abuses.

The parties to Mali’s conflict will need to take all necessary measures to minimize harm to civilians and end unlawful attacks on civilians and civilian property. Peace deal or not, the threat to civilians across Mali remains grave.",HIGH,20240126T211500Z,Malian military government,Col.

If any god, prophet, or saint were to show up in a courtroom and testify about the injury they claimed to have suffered due to some person’s words, then I might – might – be convinced blasphemy is a crime. Until that happens, however, I will consider all such charges bogus.

There is simply no “there” there in blasphemy. No victim, no harm, no nothing. It’s a manufactured crime with zero foundation in objective reality.

Unfortunately, despite being absurdly invented, the “crime” of blasphemy is used to punish innocent people in many parts of the world, encompassing many different faiths. People can receive fines, prison sentences, and even death sentences.

One particularly egregious example comes from Indonesia, where 74-year-old Apollinaris Darmawan has spent more than three years behind bars under the country’s “blasphemy” law. His story demonstrates just how nonsensical such laws are everywhere.

Darmawan is a retired railway company executive who converted from Islam to Catholicism. He wrote a book and social media posts criticizing Indonesia’s Muslim leaders and Islamic law. In August 2020, a Muslim mob stormed his home in Bandung, West Java, dragged him into the street, and stripped him.

Police came to Darmawan’s rescue but then took him into custody and charged him with the “crime” of blasphemy. He was accused of defaming Islam and insulting the Prophet Muhammad.

In December 2020, the Bandung district court convicted Darmawan, sentencing him to five years in prison and handing him a fine equivalent to US$ 55,000. It’s not his first time either: Darmawan spent several years behind bars for an earlier blasphemy conviction, as well.

As my colleague and Indonesia expert Andreas Harsono details, his prosecution and conviction violate Darmawan’s rights to freedom of expression and belief, which are protected by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and other treaties ratified by Indonesia.

And, of course, it’s not just one case nor just one country that’s the problem here - the basic concept of “blasphemy” laws is inherently flawed.

The UN Human Rights Committee, which provides authoritative interpretations of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, has made it clear: “blasphemy laws … are incompatible with the Covenant.”

Such laws may not “discriminate in favour of or against one or certain religions or belief systems, or their adherents over another, or religious believers over non-believers.

Yes, some people might be offended by what somebody says about their sacred ideas or holy objects. I get that, and I wouldn’t go out of my way to insult anyone’s religious beliefs. I would personally consider it rude to do so.

With Luxembourg’s children returning to school this week after their Christmas break, it’s timely to reflect on what more can be done to ensure that all the world’s children can get an education.

We have made some phenomenal progress since the Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirmed in 1948 that education is everyone’s right. In 1950, fewer than half of the world’s children ages 5 to 14 were in school. Today, around 90 percent of children enroll in primary school.

But the picture is bleaker before and beyond primary education. Around a third of the world’s children don’t make it to secondary school, and more than half don’t complete it. Nearly half of preschool-age children worldwide are not enrolled in a pre-primary program. Meanwhile in the EU, France tops the scoreboard with 99.5 percent enrollment in early childhood education, and Croatia boasts the highest secondary school completion rate at 97 percent.

For many, the cost is what prevents parents from enrolling their children in pre-primary and secondary education. Human Rights Watch has interviewed children and parents across Africa, Asia, and the Middle East who said their inability to pay tuition or other school fees kept children from school.

International human rights law enshrines the right to free primary education—the stronger focus on primary education being a legacy of the era when various treaties were drafted, between the 1960s and 80s. But decades of research—and everyday experiences—demonstrate that primary education alone is insufficient to prepare children to thrive.

Updating international law to reflect today’s realities, by way of a treaty that would explicitly guarantee all children free education from pre-primary through secondary school, would accelerate global progress and focus world attention on removing one the biggest barriers to education. Backing from all EU countries for such a treaty could be decisive.

Brain development is at its fastest in children’s early years, so it’s a critical opportunity to make a difference. Quality pre-primary education has long-term benefits for children’s cognitive and social development, and health. Preschool aids children’s successful transition to primary school and later educational attainment. It ensures children with disabilities are included and supported in classrooms from the early years, promotes their enrollment, and reduces discriminatory attitudes against them. Pre-primary education reduces inequalities among children from different income backgrounds.

Secondary education, including technical and vocational training, empowers youth with a wider breadth of subject knowledge and skills that are essential to their futures, including a future with viable employment options and preparation for adult life. Children with quality secondary education are more likely to find work as adults, earn more, and escape or avoid poverty. They are more likely to adopt healthier diets, seek medical care, have better mental health, and are less likely to have unintended pregnancies. Secondary education boosts political participation, reduces marginalization, and enables children to use modern technologies. Ensuring children are enrolled and stay in secondary school helps prevent child labor, child marriage, and recruitment by armed groups.

Failing to guarantee free pre-primary and secondary education disproportionately harms girls and women. Many parents with limited resources face social pressure to prioritize their boys over their girls, so secondary education fees in particular keep girls from school. Excluding children from preschool hinders parents—overwhelmingly mothers—from engaging in paid employment or otherwise participating in public life.

Expanding free public pre-primary and secondary education comes with significant costs to governments, but education investments provide enormous societal dividends and contribute to economic growth, thus paying for themselves many times over. Several low- and lower-middle economy countries have recently increased free or compulsory pre-primary education, including Comoros, Lebanon, Madagascar, Mongolia, Nepal, Sierra Leone, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.

Even so, some countries will need international assistance. The UN estimates that the funding gap for free education from pre-primary through secondary could be filled if 40 higher-income countries met existing commitments to dedicate at least 0.7 percent of gross national income to oversees assistance—like Luxembourg already does—and allocated 10 percent of that support to education.

Last year some progress was made. A group of 73 countries joined a statement led by Luxembourg and the Dominican Republic at the UN’s Human Rights Council, expressing support to strengthen the right to education to include an explicit right to at least one year of free pre-primary education and full free secondary.

As a next step, all EU members should support a new human rights treaty to explicitly recognize every child’s right to early childhood education, including at least one year of free pre-primary education, and to strengthen the right to free secondary education. It is an ambitious goal. But with Luxembourg’s leadership, it is possible. Doing so would open the possibility of millions more children sharing the joy of heading back to school in years to come.",MEDIUM,20240109T120000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Children, parents",Global Governments,Worldwide,Support a human rights treaty for free early childhood and secondary education,Failure to guarantee free pre-primary and secondary education for all children,Luxembourg,"Economic barriers, social pressures to prioritize boys over girls"

Small acts of kindness in the overwhelming face of uncontrolled violence and disaster are an essential reaffirmation of humanity when it feels most eclipsed by cruelty and hatred. Those of us who have worked, served or lived amid or close to war and persecution often find remarkable and unexpected expressions of kindness, beauty amid ugliness and glimmers of hope in situations of despair.

When I visit with refugees, often still traumatized by recent losses and in conditions of need, I am struck by the number of times they have shown me, a stranger in their midst, simple acts of kindness: in places where everyone sits on earthen floors, rummaging for something approximating a chair for the elderly man interviewing them to sit on, guiding me to a safer place, or sharing their food, when they are surviving on rations.

Last year, I found a rudimentary “tea shop,” a rickety table and plastic stools, in an alley of a slum of Istanbul, Turkey, where I was interviewing undocumented young men from Afghanistan. I asked about their journeys, especially about recent, brutal pushbacks from Turkey to Iran and from Greece to Turkey.

I remember one young man, a member of the persecuted Hazara minority of Afghanistan, who had been in constant danger and hardship after fleeing his country four months previously.

""We ate grass, we were so hungry""

He waited to the side much of the day as I conducted long interviews with others, and then came to tell me his story. He had been interrogated by an ISIS-affiliated militia when he crossed from Iran to Pakistan, a group targeting Hazaras for attack. Iranian police shot at his group as they crossed the mountainous border from Pakistan.

“We ate grass, we were so hungry, crossing the mountains on foot,” he told me.

After he crossed the barbed wire fences and trenches on the border separating Iran and Turkey, Turkish border police caught him and about 50 people he was traveling with and took them to a base about five minutes from the border fence.

""At the base they stripped us of our clothes and our belongings, set them on fire, and beat and kicked us,"" he said. ""They used police batons and wooden sticks to beat us, about 2 inches in diameter. They also whipped us with their belts. They hit me on my arms and knees with a wooden stick. I tried to protect my head with my hands, which is why my arms got beaten. … Some people were taken away and I never saw them again.""

Only a couple of nights before talking to me, he tried going to Greece, he said, “but the police caught me, stripped me and sent me back.”

Beaten and stripped, the young refugee continued his journey.

This young man, brutalized and literally stripped multiple times, had nothing but the clothes he could scrounge to cover his nakedness. The last thing he said was: “Tomorrow, I will try to cross into Greece again. The whole journey has been really hard. I have only survived by my parents’ prayers.”

The young Hazara man disappeared in the shadows. I went on to the last interview of the day. I never saw or heard from him again.

At the end of the day after my last interview, I gathered my things and went to the shopkeeper to settle the bill for the tea the refugees and I had been drinking for most of the day. He waved his hands, shook his head, and said no need.

(Nairobi) – Horn of Africa governments grappled with rampant wartime atrocities and humanitarian crises throughout 2023 with meager international assistance, Human Rights Watch said today in its World Report 2024. Unaddressed historical grievances and impunity for serious crimes continued to spur widespread violations against civilians in the region.

The conflicts in Sudan and Ethiopia have had a staggering impact on civilians, resulting in massive loss of life, destruction of property and large-scale displacements. Instead of treating these crises as priorities, influential governments and United Nations and regional bodies have repeatedly pursued short-term gains at the expense of rights-driven solutions.

“Sudan and Ethiopia provide chilling examples of government forces and armed groups flouting international law with few consequences for their actions,” said Mausi Segun, Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “Greater global and regional action is needed to protect civilians and end the cycles of abuses and impunity that put civilians at risk.”

In the 740-page World Report 2024, its 34th edition, Human Rights Watch reviewed human rights practices in more than 100 countries. In her introductory essay, Executive Director Tirana Hassan says that 2023 was a consequential year not only for human rights suppression and wartime atrocities but also for selective government outrage and transactional diplomacy that carried profound costs for the rights of those not in on the deal. But she says there were also signs of hope, showing the possibility of a different path, and calls on governments to consistently uphold their human rights obligations.

In Sudan, since April the armed conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces, an independent armed force, has had disastrous consequences for civilians.

The warring parties have repeatedly used heavy weapons in densely populated areas and destroyed critical infrastructure including medical facilities. Thousands of civilians have been killed and injured, while millions have fled their homes, sparking a humanitarian crisis. Some of the worst abuses have taken place in West Darfur, where the Rapid Support Forces and allied militias have deliberately targeted non-Arab civilians, engaging in mass killings, sexual violence, and widespread arson across towns.

After parties to the conflict in northern Ethiopia signed a cessation of hostilities agreement in November 2022, the limited international efforts to promote meaningful accountability, and an end to abuses quickly dissipated. Ethiopia’s partners, including the United States and the European Union and its member states, began normalizing relations with the federal government despite crimes against humanity and other grave abuses, notably in Amhara and Tigray, and elsewhere.

Conflicts and climate-related events have displaced millions across the region. The Sudan conflict has forced more than 1.2 million people to flee to neighboring countries. Among them were refugees living in Sudan, which already hosts to over 2 million South Sudanese refugees, and hundreds of thousands of Eritreans, Ethiopians, and others. Despite pervasive needs, appeals for aid in the region remain grossly underfunded.

Across the region, warring parties’ deliberate actions have exacerbated humanitarian crises. In Ethiopia, Eritrean forces blocked humanitarian assistance from reaching communities in parts of Tigray under their control, while heavy fighting, frequent telecommunication disruptions, and attacks on aid workers constrained relief operations in Amhara.

In Sudan and Ethiopia, humanitarian operations have been seriously hindered by attacks on aid workers, widespread looting of assistance, and obstructive bureaucratic requirements including bans on supplies. Since April, hundreds of thousands of people fleeing Sudan’s conflict have arrived in South Sudan, including South Sudanese returnees as well as refugees. This has exacerbated the country’s already severe humanitarian crisis, fueled by conflict, chronic and cyclical food insecurity, and extreme weather patterns, as well as reduced humanitarian funding.

The UN Security Council’s response to widespread civilian harm and major displacement in Ethiopia and Sudan has been minimal. Its three African members did not promote robust and meaningful deliberations on protecting civilians in either country.

More positively, the UN Human Rights Council voted to establish an independent international fact-finding mission to investigate abuses in Sudan. Still, the Security Council and concerned governments, as well as regional actors, notably the African Union and its human rights body, should prioritize accountability in any political settlement of the conflict.

By contrast, efforts to promote accountability in Ethiopia suffered major reversals. The EU, key to earlier UN Human Rights Council resolutions on Ethiopia, in September discontinued UN scrutiny over the human rights situation, despite a highly critical report by the Human Rights Council-mandated International Commission of Human Rights Experts on Ethiopia (ICHREE). Member states failed to press for the commission’s renewal, while the African Union’s rights mechanism let its own independent inquiry cease altogether. Governments relented to the Ethiopian government’s resistance to continued international scrutiny to support its efforts to establish a domestic transitional justice process. Victims of serious abuses expressed deep mistrust in Ethiopia’s institutions, which have failed to provide accountability for abuses by Ethiopian and other, notably Eritrean forces.

“Throughout the Horn of Africa, victims of serious abuses and their families along with activists have repeatedly demanded civilian protection, redress for violations, and accountability for those responsible, including people in positions of power,” Segun said. “International and regional organizations and influential governments have deeply disappointed those in need with their lackluster approach to ongoing human rights and humanitarian crises.”",HIGH,20240111T081500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Mohamed Hamdan Daglo",Sudanese Armed Forces and Rapid Support Forces,"Sudan, particularly West Darfur","Increased accountability measures, prioritization of civilian protection in political settlements.","Widespread violations against civilians including mass killings, sexual violence, and arson",Sudan,"Historical grievances, impunity for serious crimes"

(Beirut) – Warring parties in Yemen, including Houthi forces, the Yemeni government, and the Saudi and UAE-led coalition, carried out serious international human rights and humanitarian law violations in Yemen in 2023, Human Rights Watch said today in releasing its World Report 2024.

These violations included unlawful attacks which killed civilians and arbitrarily detentions. In Taizz, the country’s third-largest city, warring parties violated the rights to water, freedom of movement, and humanitarian access.

“The international community has failed to follow through on its commitments to people in Yemen, while warring parties’ violations have only continued,” said Niku Jafarnia, Yemen and Bahrain researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Without accountability for these abuses over the last nine years, there won’t be a foundation for a durable peace.”

In the 740-page World Report 2024, its 34th edition, Human Rights Watch reviews human rights practices in more than 100 countries. In her introductory essay, Executive Director Tirana Hassan says that 2023 was a consequential year not only for human rights suppression and wartime atrocities but also for selective government outrage and transactional diplomacy that carried profound costs for the rights of those not in on the deal. But she says there were also signs of hope, showing the possibility of a different path, and calls on governments to consistently uphold their human rights obligations.

People in Yemen face one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises, with more than 21 million residents in need of assistance and suffering from inadequate food, health care, and infrastructure. Despite this, all parties to the conflict have taken actions that have deepened Yemenis’ suffering. The Saudi and UAE-led coalition in particular has attacked food, water, and health infrastructure. The Houthis have imposed an abusive siege on Taizz and blocked water from entering the public water network. The Yemeni government and the Houthis have also imposed unnecessary restrictions and regulations on humanitarian organizations and aid projects, creating lengthy delays.

Saudi border guards have killed at least hundreds of Ethiopian migrants and asylum seekers who tried to cross the Yemen-Saudi border between March 2022 and June 2023. If committed as part of a Saudi government policy to murder migrants, these killings, which appear to be continuing, would be a crime against humanity. Human Rights Watch found that Saudi border guards have used explosive weapons to kill many migrants and have shot others at close range, including many women and children, in a widespread and systematic pattern of attacks. In some instances, Saudi border guards asked migrants which limb to shoot, and then shot them at close range.

All parties to the conflict, including Houthi forces, the Yemeni government, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and various UAE and Saudi-backed Yemeni armed groups, have arbitrarily arrested, forcibly disappeared, tortured, and mistreated detainees across Yemen. Hundreds of Yemenis have been detained at official and unofficial detention centers across the country. On May 25, Houthi forces stormed a private residence in Sanaa where Yemeni Bahais were meeting and detained and subsequently disappeared 17 people.

Yemeni women also face restrictions on their freedom of movement, both in Houthi-controlled areas and in government and Southern Transitional Council-controlled areas.

There has been virtually no accountability for violations committed by parties to the conflict. Since the United Nations Human Rights Council narrowly voted to end the mandate of the Group of Eminent Experts on Yemen in October 2021, there has been no independent international entity to monitor the human rights situation in Yemen and lay the foundation for accountability for widespread abuses.",HIGH,20240111T161500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Niku Jafarnia, Tirana Hassan","Houthi forces, Yemeni government, Saudi and UAE-led coalition","Taizz, Yemen","Urgent need for accountability mechanisms, recommitment by the international community to uphold human rights obligations","Serious international human rights and humanitarian law violations, including unlawful attacks, arbitrary detentions, and obstructing humanitarian access",Yemen,"Ongoing conflict between various parties, lack of accountability, humanitarian crisis"

(Amman) – Jordanian authorities in 2023 limited civic space and enacted a new cybercrime law that further undermines free speech and privacy online, Human Rights Watch said today in its World Report 2024. Jordanian authorities arrested and harassed peaceful dissidents and journalists and used vague and abusive laws to limit free speech and peaceful activism.

“Between the constant threat of harassment and arrest and the new risk of intrusive digital surveillance, activists working to strengthen democracy and push human rights reforms in Jordan are facing a tougher landscape,” said Adam Coogle, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. “Jordanian authorities should reverse course on limits to civic space and allow Jordanians to participate in public affairs as the country faces significant challenges.”

In the 740-page World Report 2024, its 34th edition, Human Rights Watch reviews human rights practices in more than 100 countries. In her introductory essay, Executive Director Tirana Hassan says that 2023 was a consequential year not only for human rights suppression and wartime atrocities but also for selective government outrage and transactional diplomacy that carried profound costs for the rights of those not in on the deal. But she says there were also signs of hope, showing the possibility of a different path, and calls on governments to consistently uphold their human rights obligations.

Jordan is grappling with high unemployment, particularly for youth and women, coupled with a sharp rise in poverty following the pandemic. An increase in the cost of living makes it difficult for many people to afford necessities.

Human Rights Watch reported in June that Jordan’s automated cash transfer program for workers on low incomes developed with significant financing from the World Bank is undermined by errors, discriminatory policies, and stereotypes about poverty. The program is part of a social protection system that is failing to provide support to many people even as they go hungry, fall behind on rent, and take on crippling debt.

Jordan remains one of the few countries that still allows imprisoning people for debt, which is prohibited under international law. In 2023, the authorities lifted the pandemic-related state of emergency, ending a moratorium on debt-related imprisonment for sums exceeding 5,000 Jordanian dinars (about US$7,000).

In August, Jordan’s parliament hastily overhauled the country’s cybercrime law, circumventing public discourse and input. The law uses imprecise, vague, and undefined terminology like “fake news,” “inciting immorality,” and “online assassination of personality.” Such language falls short of meeting international legal standards for clear and precise legislation, making it difficult for people to understand and adhere to the law.

Notably, the authorities dramatically increased penalties for online defamation or “character assassination” to a minimum three-month jail sentence or a fine of up to 20,000 Jordanian dinars (about US$28,000).

(Beirut) – Iranian authorities show no signs of ending their brutal repression of peaceful dissent across the country one year after nationwide protests that erupted after the death in morality police custody of Mahsa Jina Amini in September 2022, Human Rights Watch said today in its World Report 2024. The authorities have also consolidated their efforts to increase punitive measures against women who defy compulsory hijab laws and businesses that do not enforce them on their premises.

Iranian authorities have killed hundreds of protesters, arrested thousands of people, and tortured scores of detainees, including women and children. Human rights groups are investigating the killing of more than 500 people, including 69 children, during the protests. The authorities have refused to open transparent investigations into security forces’ use of excessive and lethal force, torture, sexual assault, and other serious abuses, and have instead pressured families of victims to not hold public memorial services.

“For many, everyday life in Iran feels like a battle with a corrupt, autocratic government that has brought down the full force of its repressive machinery to quash dissent,” said Michael Page, Middle East deputy director. “Iranian authorities should know that anything short of fundamental change will only deepen public anger and frustration against their mismanagement and brutality.”

In the 740-page World Report 2024, its 34th edition, Human Rights Watch reviews human rights practices in more than 100 countries. In her introductory essay, Executive Director Tirana Hassan says that 2023 was a consequential year not only for human rights suppression and wartime atrocities but also for selective government outrage and transactional diplomacy that carried profound costs for the rights of those not in on the deal. But she says there were also signs of hope, showing the possibility of a different path, and calls on governments to consistently uphold their human rights obligations.

Scores of human rights defenders, journalists, members of ethnic and religious minorities, and dissidents are serving lengthy sentences after being convicted of national security charges in grossly unfair trials. Detained protesters have died in suspicious circumstances.

In the months leading up to the protest anniversary, Iranian authorities increased their crackdown on peaceful dissent through intimidation, arrests, prosecutions, and trials of activists, artists, dissidents, lawyers, academics, students, and family members of those who were killed during the 2022 protests.

Iranian authorities substantially increased the rates of executions in 2023. During the 2022 protests, judicial authorities drastically increased the use of vaguely defined national security charges that could carry the death penalty against protesters, including for allegedly injuring others and destroying public property. Following grossly unfair trials in which many defendants did not have access to the lawyer of their choice, Iranian authorities issued 25 death sentences in connection to the protests. As of September 20, the authorities executed seven people, though the Supreme Court overturned 11 other cases.

Iranian authorities intensified efforts to enforce compulsory hijab laws. They prosecuted women and girls, including actors, who refuse to wear the hijab in public, issued traffic citations for passengers without the hijab, and temporarily closed businesses that do not comply with hijab laws. In recent cases, the judiciary mandated psychological treatment for at least two actresses convicted of not complying with hijab laws, a move Iranian mental health associations protested.

On September 21, the Iranian parliament approved a draft Hijab and Chastity Bill with 70 articles proposing additional penalties, such as fines, increased prison terms up to 10 years for expressing opposition to hijab regulations, and restrictions on job and educational opportunities for hijab violations. The law also expands the authority of intelligence and law enforcement agencies in enforcing the compulsory hijab.

The authorities also intensified pressure on the Bahai religious minority community, arresting and resentencing several prominent members of the community.

Human Rights Watch documented far harsher use of repressive tactics, including arbitrary arrests and excessive use of force, in ethnic and religious minority areas of Kurdistan province and Sistan and Baluchistan province, which have played leading roles during the protests. Over the past year, the authorities have imposed several localized internet shutdowns, particularly in Sistan and Baluchistan province during mass protests.

(London, January 11, 2024) – The United Kingdom government’s policies and practices both severely eroded domestic human rights protections and undermined its efforts to promote human rights globally in 2023, Human Rights Watch said today in its World Report 2024.

“The UK had another dismal year for human rights in 2023,” said Yasmine Ahmed, UK director at Human Rights Watch. “The government continued its assault on fundamental rights in the UK, including to protest and seek asylum, which alongside the application of double standards in its foreign policy, undermined its efforts to promote human rights globally.”

In the 740-page World Report 2024, its 34th edition, Human Rights Watch reviews human rights practices in more than 100 countries. In her introductory essay, Executive Director Tirana Hassan says that 2023 was a consequential year not only for human rights suppression and wartime atrocities but also for selective government outrage and transactional diplomacy that carried profound costs for the rights of those not in on the deal. But she says there were also signs of hope, showing the possibility of a different path, and calls on governments to consistently uphold their human rights obligations.

In 2023, the UK government weakened basic freedoms, like people’s right to protest, with new legislation. The UK’s pursuit of its plan to transfer asylum seekers to Rwanda and the introduction of the Illegal Migration Act attacked the rights of refugees and asylum seekers and generally had a corrosive influence on international norms and standards.

In April, the government passed the Public Order Act , further criminalizing people’s right to peaceful protest; undermining freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, and association; and limiting workers’ strikes. The law came amid an ongoing crackdown on people protesting the government’s increasingly regressive climate change policies.

In July, the UK government adopted the widely condemned Illegal Migration Act, which bans access to asylum and undermines modern slavery and trafficking protections for anyone who arrives “irregularly” to the UK. The government continued to defend its controversial asylum deal with Rwanda before the Supreme Court, after the Court of Appeal ruled that Rwanda was not a safe third country to send asylums seekers to. In November, the Supreme Court confirmed that the UK-Rwanda scheme was unlawful because Rwanda was not deemed a safe third country. The government reacted to the judgment by vowing to adopt emergency legislation to confirm Rwanda as a safe country and agree to a treaty with Rwanda to replace the existing memorandum of understanding.

Despite an ongoing cost of living crisis, the UK government failed to adopt policies to ensure people’s rights to social security and an adequate standard of living, including food and adequate housing.

The UK authorities also fail to adequately address racial inequalities and discrimination. The UK government apologized in 2018 after thousands of Black Britons belonging to the Windrush generation were deported, detained, and denied their rights because of repeated policy failings by the Home Office. Yet the government continues to fail these people, who still face serious difficulties accessing a complex and inaccessible compensation program, and backed away in 2023 from some of the recommendations from an independent inquiry into the scandal. The United Nations Working Group on People of African Descent condemned these failings during its UK visit in January 2023.

The UK government continued to fail to remedy the forced eviction of the entire Chagossian people from their homeland in the Chagos Archipelago islands, who they forcibly displaced over 50 years ago, in complicity with the United States government, with many Chagossians now residing in the UK. There are current negotiations between the UK and Mauritius about the sovereignty of the islands, but the Chagossians have not been effectively consulted. The UK has refused to provide them with full reparations, including their right to return.

On the world stage, the government used its position and influence to call out abuses in Sudan, Ukraine, Iran, Belarus, and elsewhere. But it was willing to flout its international legal obligations and apply double standards when it suited the government’s purposes.

Following the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, the UK government rightly condemned Hamas’ deliberate killings of civilians and taking of hostages, which amount to war crimes. However, it has failed to call out Israel’s collective punishment of the people of Gaza by cutting electricity, water, fuel, and food, which are also war crimes, nor signal any concern with Israel’s incessant aerial bombardment that has killed thousands of children and other civilians and reduced large parts of neighborhoods to rubble. The hostilities gave rise to an increase in reports of antisemitism and Islamophobic incidents in the UK, according to civil society groups and the police in London.

(Tunis) – Tunisia experienced further regression in terms of human rights and the rule of law during 2023 in the absence of genuine checks and balances on President Kais Saied’s power, Human Rights Watch said today in its World Report 2024. The government has taken new steps to muzzle free speech, prosecute dissent, and crack down on migrants and asylum seekers.

“Over the past year, President Saied jailed dozens of his opponents and critics, fueled racism and xenophobia against Black migrants and refugees, and threatened the activities of civil society,” said Salsabil Chellali, Tunisia director at Human Rights Watch. “The imprisoning of dissidents and the subjugation of the judiciary are more severe today than at any time since the revolution of 2011.”

In the 740-page World Report 2024, its 34th edition, Human Rights Watch reviews human rights practices in more than 100 countries. In her introductory essay, Executive Director Tirana Hassan says that 2023 was a consequential year not only for human rights suppression and wartime atrocities but also for selective government outrage and transactional diplomacy that carried profound costs for the rights of those not in on the deal. But she says there were also signs of hope, showing the possibility of a different path, and calls on governments to consistently uphold their human rights obligations.

Beginning in February, Tunisian authorities stepped up politically motivated arrests and prosecutions of opposition figures of various political tendencies, lawyers, activists, and journalists. At least 40 opponents or individuals deemed critical of the authorities were behind bars as of December, with most of them accused of “conspiracy against state security” or dubious terrorism related charges, often merely for their peaceful speech or activism.

Tunisian authorities continued to undermine judicial independence by targeting lawyers for defending their clients or expressing their opinions, and ignoring a 2022 court order to reinstate judges arbitrarily dismissed by President Saied. At least 27 lawyers faced civil or military prosecutions as of September.

The authorities have also used a recent cybercrime decree-law, which imposes heavy prison sentences for spreading “fake news” and “rumors” online, to arbitrarily detain, prosecute, or investigate at least 21 people for speech offenses, in one case before a military court.

After Saied made public comments in February linking undocumented Black African migrants to crime and a purported conspiracy to change Tunisia’s demographics, Black African foreigners suffered a surge in attacks by Tunisian citizens.

Throughout the year, the Tunisian police, military, and national guard, including the coast guard, committed serious abuses against Black African migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers, including beatings, use of excessive force, some cases of torture, arbitrary arrests and detention, collective expulsions to perilous border regions, and dangerous actions at sea during boat interceptions. According to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, some 2,000 migrants and asylum-seekers, including women and children, were expelled to Tunisia’s borders with Libya and Algeria in July and August alone.",HIGH,20240111T180000Z,Human Rights Watch,"President Kais Saied, Salsabil Chellali, Tirana Hassan",Tunisian authorities,Tunisia,"Uphold human rights obligations, support for civil society, restore judicial independence","Suppression of human rights, targeting dissent, racism against Black migrants",Tunisia,"Lack of checks and balances, political repression, xenophobic rhetoric"

(Jerusalem) – Civilians were targeted, attacked, abused, and killed over the past year at a scale unprecedented in the recent history of Israel and Palestine, Human Rights Watch said today in releasing its World Report 2024.

More than 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals in Israel and, as of January 4, more than 22,000 Palestinians in Gaza, the majority of them civilians, have been killed since October 7, 2023, according to local authorities, amid hostilities between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups in Gaza that have included unlawful attacks and other grave abuses. Meanwhile, killings, administrative detention, and settler violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank reached years-long highs.

“The heinous crimes carried out by Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups since October 7 are the abhorrent legacy of decades-long impunity for unlawful attacks and Israel’s systematic repression of Palestinians,” said Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch. “How many more civilians must suffer or be killed as a result of war crimes before countries supplying weapons pull the plug and otherwise take action to end these atrocities?”

In the 740-page World Report 2024, its 34th edition, Human Rights Watch reviews human rights practices in more than 100 countries. In her introductory essay, Executive Director Tirana Hassan says that 2023 was a consequential year not only for human rights suppression and wartime atrocities but also for selective government outrage and transactional diplomacy that carried profound costs for the rights of those not in on the deal. But she says there were also signs of hope, showing the possibility of a different path, and calls on governments to consistently uphold their human rights obligations.

On October 7, Hamas-led gunmen from the Gaza Strip carried out an attack in southern Israel, deliberately killing civilians, firing into crowds and gunning people down in their homes, and taking hostages back to Gaza, including older people and children, acts that amount to war crimes. About 128 people were still held hostage as of January 2, according to Israeli authorities.

Shortly thereafter, Israeli authorities cut off essential services, including water and electricity, to Gaza’s population and blocked the entry of all but a trickle of fuel and critical humanitarian aid, acts of collective punishment that amount to war crimes and include the use of starvation as a method of warfare. Israeli air strikes have incessantly pounded Gaza, hitting schools and hospitals and reducing large parts of neighborhoods to rubble, including in attacks that were apparently unlawful. Israeli forces also unlawfully used white phosphorous in densely populated areas. They ordered the evacuation of everyone in northern Gaza and had displaced an estimated 85 percent of Gaza’s population—1.9 million people—as of January 2.

The blockade exacerbated the humanitarian situation stemming from Israel’s 16-year-long sweeping restrictions on the movement of people and goods into and out of Gaza. The prolonged closure, as well as Egyptian restrictions on its border with Gaza, has deprived the 2.2 million Palestinians of Gaza, with rare exceptions, of their right to freedom of movement and opportunities to better their lives; severely limited their access to electricity, health care, and water; and devastated the economy.

In the West Bank, Israeli forces in 2023 killed 492 Palestinians, including 120 children, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), more than twice as many as in any other year since 2005, when the UN began systematically recording fatalities. This includes unlawful killings stemming from Israel’s regular use of excessive lethal force and some cases of extrajudicial executions.

As of January 1, Israeli authorities also held 3,291 Palestinians in administrative detention, without charge or trial, based on secret information, according to Israeli Prison Services figures. This figure marks a three-decade high, according to the Israeli human rights group HaMoked.

During the first half of 2023, the Israeli government approved building 12,855 new housing units in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, the highest number the Israeli group Peace Now, which has been systematically tracking plans since 2012, has ever recorded. The transfer of civilians into occupied territory is a war crime.

During the first eight months of 2023, incidents of settler violence against Palestinians and their property reached their highest daily average since the UN started recording this data in 2006; an average of three incidents a day, compared with two a day in 2022 and one in 2021. That rate further increased after October 7. OCHA recorded 1,227 incidents of settler violence in 2023 that resulted in casualties and/or property damage, more than in any year since it started recording incidents involving settlers in 2006.

(Berlin, January 11, 2024) – Western governments are intensifying their relations with Central Asian countries against the backdrop of Russia’s war on Ukraine, offering an opportunity to achieve specific advances for human rights, Human Rights Watch said today in its World Report 2024.

Central Asia’s authoritarian governments severely restrict freedoms of speech, assembly, and other fundamental freedoms, arbitrarily lock up government opponents and critics, and allow impunity for serious human rights violations, including torture and domestic violence. High-level diplomacy by the United States, the European Union, and EU member states should focus on ending such abuses in the region, especially since Central Asian leaders have shown interest in this rapprochement to diversify their foreign policy options.

“The West’s renewed interest in Central Asia coincides with human rights backtracking or stagnation across the region,” said Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “As Western and Central Asian states bolster ties, it’s critically important for other countries to make human rights concerns a central part of the agenda and for Central Asian governments to follow through on promised reforms.”

In the 740-page World Report 2024, its 34th edition, Human Rights Watch reviews human rights practices in more than 100 countries. In her introductory essay, Executive Director Tirana Hassan says that 2023 was a consequential year not only for human rights suppression and wartime atrocities but also for selective government outrage and transactional diplomacy that carried profound costs for the rights of those not in on the deal. But she says there were also signs of hope, showing the possibility of a different path, and calls on governments to consistently uphold their human rights obligations.

In the two years since large-scale protests rocked the country, authorities in Kazakhstan have failed to ensure accountability for the disproportionate use of force against protesters or for the arbitrary arrests, imprisonment, ill-treatment, and torture of detainees in the aftermath.

Violent attacks on journalists increased in early 2023 and authorities have persisted in using overbroad criminal charges against government critics and activists. Among them are Marat Zhylanbaev, an outspoken government critic, sentenced to seven years in prison in late November and Zhanbolat Mamay, an activist, sentenced to a six year suspended sentence in April and banned from engaging in political activities.

New legislation strengthening protections for women fell short of criminalizing domestic violence as a stand-alone offense. Kazakhstan continues to impose heavy restrictions in law and practice on the right to peaceful assembly.

Human rights protection and civil liberties in Kyrgyzstan continued to decline in 2023, with systematic stifling of critical voices by the authorities. Civil society and media freedom came under severe threat, with criminal cases against leading media outlets and draft laws that would expand censorship and government control over nongovernmental organizations. A law was adopted banning “propaganda of non-traditional relations and same-sex partnerships.”

Scores of activists, journalists, human rights defenders, and politicians remain in pretrial detention on charges of fomenting “mass unrest” over disagreement with the transfer of a dam to Uzbekistan in a border agreement. An effective and independent investigation into the death in custody of the human rights defender Azimjon Askarov in 2020 is yet to be completed.

In Tajikistan’s repressive political and human rights climate, the government forced hundreds of nongovernmental organizations to close, detained scores of bloggers for their opinions on the government’s policies, and banned or limited the activities of religious organizations. Several political movements and parties seen as a threat to the government remain banned, including the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan and Group 24, with their members serving lengthy prison terms and some subjected to forced returns from abroad.

A crackdown on dissenting voices in the Gorno-Badakshan Autonomous Oblast following violent dispersal of peaceful protests by the Pamiri minority in 2022 was expanded into the prohibition of Pamiri languages and Ismaili religious practices. Tajik authorities also cooperated with the government of Turkey on the abduction and forced return of two Turkish citizens affiliated with the movement led by US-based cleric Fethullah Gülen.

Turkmenistan’s government remains closed and repressive, quashing religious and political expression that is not sanctioned by the authorities. The government tightly controls the media and access to information, prosecutes people who enable access to an uncensored internet, and allows no independent monitoring groups. The authorities also jail perceived opponents and government critics and harass activists abroad and their relatives in Turkmenistan. Dozens of people remain victims of enforced disappearance.

The government denies its citizens access to passport renewal services abroad, in contravention of international law, in an effort to force them to return to the country. Despite the ongoing economic crisis, Turkmenistan did not take any meaningful steps to address poverty in the country or to ensure food security for economically vulnerable groups. Consensual same-sex relations between men remain a criminal offense, and women’s rights are severely restricted.

Uzbekistan’s human rights record deteriorated in 2023, with a notable increase in harassment and prosecutions of bloggers and journalists, impunity for human rights abuses committed during protests in Karakalpakstan in 2022, and promised legislative reforms continuing to stall. The Karakalpak blogger and lawyer Dauletmurat Tazhimuratov was imprisoned for 16 years for allegedly instigating the unrest, while the authorities ignored his claims of torture.

The Justice Ministry continued to deny registration to independent human rights groups and authorities blocked several people, including a human rights monitor, from entering Uzbekistan. Consensual same-sex relations between men remain criminalized, and impunity for torture and ill-treatment persists. In April 2023, Uzbekistan adopted legislative amendments criminalizing domestic violence and increasing protections for women and girls, although domestic violence remains a pervasive and serious problem.",HIGH,20240111T180000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Marat Zhylanbaev, Zhanbolat Mamay, Azimjon Askarov",Kazakhstan authorities,"Almaty, Kazakhstan",Western governments should prioritize human rights in diplomatic discussions.,Serious human rights violations including torture and domestic violence,Kazakhstan,"Authoritarian governance, systemic abuse, impunity"

(Beirut) – After decades of armed conflict, Iraq has enjoyed its most stable period since before the US-led invasion of 2003. However, the country remained fragile and deeply divided as grievances over widespread corruption, unemployment, and poor public services, which drove mass protests in 2019 remained unresolved. Impunity for violent repression of protesters and arrests of journalists covering demonstrations continued in 2023, Human Rights Watch said today in its World Report 2024.

“Iraq should capitalize on this period of calm to enact reforms that uphold freedom of expression, provide Iraqis with an adequate standard of living, and ensure accountability for rights violations in order to create conditions for further peace and prosperity in the country,” said Sarah Sanbar, Iraq researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Without addressing ongoing abuses, Iraq risks falling into yet another cycle of violence.”

In the 740-page World Report 2024, its 34th edition, Human Rights Watch reviews human rights practices in more than 100 countries. In her introductory essay, Executive Director Tirana Hassan says that 2023 was a consequential year not only for human rights suppression and wartime atrocities but also for selective government outrage and transactional diplomacy that carried profound costs for the rights of those not in on the deal. But she says there were also signs of hope, showing the possibility of a different path, and calls on governments to consistently uphold their human rights obligations.

Six years after Iraqi and US-led coalition forces retook the last territory controlled by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS), the security situation has largely stabilized. But around 1.16 million Iraqis, including 60 percent of the population of the town of Sinjar, remain internally displaced, mostly across the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI). In April 2023, the Ministry of Migration and Displacement hastily closed the Jeddah 5 camp, the last official camp for internally displaced people in federal Iraq, with little advance notice, and despite concerns about camp residents’ safety if forced to return to their areas of origin.

Since January 2021, Iraqi authorities have repatriated about 10,000 Iraqis unlawfully detained as ISIS suspects and family members in northeast Syria: nearly 7,000 from al-Hol camp, mostly women and children, and about 3,000 men, held in prisons, whom Iraq said it was prosecuting. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and US officials have lauded the returns, though some nongovernmental organizations and UN staff have questioned whether the repatriations meet UN principles for safe and voluntary returns.

Women and girls continued to struggle against discrimination embedded in the legal system. Iraq’s penal code enables impunity for certain cases of male violence against women, including provisions that allow a husband to physically punish his wife, and mitigated sentences for violent acts including murder for so-called honorable motives. Women’s rights groups continued to advocate an anti-domestic violence law, but efforts in parliament stalled by the end of 2023.

The penal code also permits corporal punishment of children. In June 2023, the Iraqi parliament introduced a draft child protection law, a vital step in safeguarding children’s rights. Over the last 20 years, rates of child marriage have steadily increased. Poverty, insecurity, and lower educational outcomes for girls have all been associated with the higher rates.

The UN ranked Iraq as the fifth most vulnerable country to global warming and climate change, and its environmental crisis has worsened steadily in scope and severity. Weak environmental protection legislation and dirty industrial practices, such as gas flaring, have contributed to rising cancer rates. A growing environmental movement seeks to address the degradation caused by conflict and resource mismanagement, prepare Iraq for the realities of climate change, and promote its transition away from a fossil-fuels based economy. Like activists across the civil society space, their efforts have been met with harassment, intimidation, and threats.

Freedom of speech and expression was increasingly under threat in 2023. Vaguely worded laws have been used to target and silence journalists, activists, and rival politicians, including in the KRI. In January 2023, the government launched a campaign to target “indecent content” online.

(The Hague) – The International Court of Justice (ICJ) hearings on January 11 and 12, 2024, on genocide in Gaza will include the first formal response by Israel before an independent and impartial court to allegations of atrocities against the Palestinian people since October 7, 2023, Human Rights Watch said today. On December 29, South Africa filed a case with the court alleging that Israel is violating the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.

On January 2, Israeli officials confirmed that Israel would be represented at the ICJ to oppose the South African government’s application. South Africa contends that Israel has violated the Genocide Convention by committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, and by failing to prevent it, including by not holding senior Israeli officials and others accountable for their direct and public incitement to genocide. The case is not a criminal proceeding against individuals but seeks a legal determination of state responsibility for genocide.

“South Africa’s case is about Israel’s obligations under the Genocide Convention and puts its conduct in Gaza in sharp focus before the United Nations’ highest judicial body,” said Balkees Jarrah, associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch. “South Africa has asked the World Court to issue urgent measures to protect Palestinians in Gaza who face catastrophic living conditions as a result of war crimes carried out by Israeli authorities.”

While the case may take several years to reach a final ruling, South Africa has asked the court to order provisional measures to protect the Palestinian people in Gaza from further harm, ensure Israel’s compliance with the Genocide Convention, and safeguard South Africa’s ability to have the case fairly adjudicated. South Africa has asked the ICJ to issue these measures “as a matter of extreme urgency,” saying that Palestinians in Gaza are in “urgent and severe need of the Court’s protection.” Arguments on the request for provisional measures are the subject of the January 11 and 12 hearings.

Among the provisional measures sought are for Israel to immediately suspend its military operations in Gaza and abide by its obligations under the Genocide Convention. South Africa also seeks measures to prevent the destruction and ensure the preservation of any evidence related to the underlying case – including by giving fact-finding missions, international mandates, and other bodies access to Gaza.

South Africa also asked the court to require Israel to report to it on steps taken to carry out a provisional measures order within a week of its issuance and then at regular intervals until the court issues its final ruling. In its oral arguments on January 11, South Africa could specifically ask the court to make Israel’s reports public.

In its application to the ICJ, South Africa says that Israel is killing Palestinians in Gaza in large numbers, causing them serious bodily and mental harm, imposing measures intended to prevent Palestinian births, and inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the destruction of Palestinians as a group. South Africa cited expulsions and mass displacement; deprivation of access to adequate food and water, medical care, shelter, clothes, hygiene, and sanitation; and the destruction of the fabric of Palestinian life in Gaza.

South Africa further contends that the “acts of genocide” should be placed in “the broader context of Israel’s conduct towards Palestinians during its 75-year-long apartheid, its 56-year-long belligerent occupation of Palestinian territory and its 16-year-long blockade of Gaza.”

South Africa contends that numerous statements by Israeli political and military officials amount to evidence of a clear intent to destroy Palestinians in Gaza as a group. It says that the “clear inference from the acts of the Israeli army on the ground…is that those genocidal statements and directives are being implemented against the Palestinian people.” South Africa’s application refers to several statements by UN experts who have warned of a risk of genocide.

The court will hear Israel’s formal response on January 12. Israel’s Foreign Affairs Ministry, in a published statement on December 29, 2023, described South Africa’s application as “blood libel” and that the claim “lacks both a factual and a legal basis and constitutes despicable and contemptuous exploitation of the Court.” One media report said that the Israeli Foreign Ministry instructed its diplomats to press officials in their host countries to issue statements against South Africa's case. The Israeli foreign minister has also specifically urged the United Kingdom to oppose South Africa’s application. The media reported on January 9 that UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said that he did not think the ICJ case was helpful.

The United States National Security Council spokesman described South Africa’s application as “meritless, counterproductive, and completely without any basis in fact whatsoever.” The US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said separately that Washington had not “at this point seen acts that constitute genocide” and that the ICJ case was “not a productive step at this time.”

A number of parties to the Genocide Convention have welcomed South Africa’s application including Bangladesh, Bolivia , Jordan , Malaysia, the Maldives, Pakistan, Palestine, Turkey, Namibia, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The Organization of Islamic Cooperation also issued a statement in support of the case. France’s UN ambassador in New York said France is a strong supporter of the ICJ and would back the court’s decisions. Governments should speak out in support of ICJ proceedings and publicly commit to supporting compliance with the court’s decisions, Human Rights Watch said.

Israeli authorities and Palestinian armed groups have committed serious abuses during the current hostilities. Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups deliberately killed hundreds of civilians in Israel on October 7 and took more than 200 hostages. The Israeli government then cut electricity, fuel, food and water to Gaza’s population and severely curtailed life-saving humanitarian aid, all acts of collective punishment, a war crime. Israeli authorities are also using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare in Gaza, which is also a war crime, Human Rights Watch said.

Past ICJ practice suggests that a decision on provisional measures could be delivered within weeks. Though such an order would be legally binding on Israel, it would not prejudge the merits of the allegations that Israel has violated the Genocide Convention. A provisional measures order is automatically sent to the UN Security Council pending a final decision in the case.

The ICJ is composed of 15 judges elected by the UN General Assembly and Security Council for nine-year terms. When two countries have a dispute and the court does not include their nationals on the bench, the governments can appoint ad-hoc judges to hear that specific matter. In this case, South Africa has appointed Dikgang Moseneke, former deputy chief justice of South Africa, and Israel has appointed Aharon Barak, a retired Israeli Supreme Court president, as ad-hoc judges.

South Africa, which ratified the Genocide Convention in 1998, brought its case under article 9 of the convention, which allows for disputes between parties to be submitted to the ICJ. The court previously confirmed that all member states of the convention have a duty to prevent and to punish genocide. Israel has been a party to the Genocide Convention since 1951.

South Africa together with Bangladesh, Bolivia, the Comoros, and Djibouti also referred the Palestine situation to the International Criminal Court prosecutor in November 2023. South Africa asked the prosecutor, Karim Khan, to investigate the crime of genocide among other grave abuses in Palestine with a view to charging the individuals responsible. Khan confirmed that his office has been conducting, since March 2021, an investigation into alleged atrocity crimes committed in Gaza and the West Bank since 2014, and that he has jurisdiction over crimes in the current hostilities between Israel and Palestinian armed groups that covers unlawful conduct by all parties. He visited Israel and Palestine in December.

In a related matter, in December 2022 the UN General Assembly requested an advisory opinion from the ICJ on the legal consequences of Israel’s prolonged occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. The General Assembly first asked the ICJ for an advisory opinion related to the Occupied Palestinian Territory 20 years ago. In 2004, the ICJ’s advisory opinion found that the route of Israel’s separation barrier violated international law and that it should be dismantled. The December 2022 request is wider in scope. South Africa, among other countries, filed a written statement in the proceeding. The ICJ will convene public hearings on the request starting on February 19.

Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo and Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib deserve praise for the country’s principled stance over the Gaza hostilities compared to most of its European counterparts. In a visit to China later this week, they should show the same resolve in urging Chinese authorities to end their atrocity crimes and pervasive repression.

Unfortunately, there are reasons to doubt whether De Croo and Lahbib are up to confronting the Chinese government on its appalling human rights record.

The two officials will be accompanied by CEOs of major Belgian companies, with the goal of boosting trade and business relations. Besides seemingly contradicting the European Union’s stated objective to “de-risk,” or reduce, supply chain dependencies from China, strengthening trade ties with Beijing should not mean overlooking the Chinese government’s serious rights abuses. These include the use of forced labor and inhumane acts against Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims, as part of a crackdown that the European Parliament and the Belgian Federal Parliament have labelled as atrocity crimes, including crimes against humanity.

De Croo and Lahbib would be wrong to discount how China’s deepening human rights crisis will have serious implications for all European countries doing business with China. Unchecked bilateral trade and business carries with it a serious risk of complicity in those crimes. This will become even more urgent when new EU legislation on human rights and environmental due diligence, as well as on banning goods made through forced labor, come into force.

They would also be wrong to pretend the Chinese government can be a reliable political and business partner while it continues to crush basic freedoms throughout the country , as well as in Tibet, Hong Kong , and even dissidents abroad, including in Europe.

De Croo and Lahbib, especially while Belgium holds the EU’s presidency, should rather clarify to their Chinese counterparts that there can be no business as usual when crimes against humanity are being committed.

They should publicly call out Beijing’s grave human rights violations, lay out consequences for bilateral relations, and state an unequivocal determination to pursue accountability for those abuses. Failure to do so would only embolden Beijing’s sense of impunity and weaken Belgium’s stance as a government committed to human rights and international law.",HIGH,20240110T084500Z,"Belgian Federal Parliament, European Parliament","Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib",Chinese government,China,Publicly call out Beijing's violations and pursue accountability for abuses.,"Atrocity crimes, including crimes against humanity",Belgium,China's political regime and suppression of freedoms

(New York) – Global leaders have failed to take strong stands to protect human rights during 2023, a year of some of the worst crises and challenges in recent memory, with deadly consequences, Human Rights Watch said today in its World Report 2024. Governments should stop engaging in transactional diplomacy and do their utmost to uphold universal human rights principles.

Renewed armed conflict between the Israeli government and Hamas caused tremendous suffering, as did conflicts in Ukraine, Myanmar, Ethiopia, and the Sahel. The year 2023 was the hottest since global records began in 1880 and the onslaught of wildfires, drought, and storms wreaked havoc on communities from Bangladesh to Libya to Canada. Economic inequality rose around the world, as did anger about the policy decisions that have left so many people struggling to survive.

“The international system that we rely on to protect human rights is under threat as world leaders look the other way when universal principles of human rights are violated,” said Tirana Hassan, executive director at Human Rights Watch. “Every time a country overlooks these universal and globally accepted principles, someone pays a price, and that price is sometimes peoples’ lives.”

World Report 2024 World Report 2024, Human Rights Watch’s 34th annual review of human rights practices and trends around the globe, reviews developments in more than 100 countries. READ HERE

In the 740-page World Report 2024, its 34th edition, Human Rights Watch reviews human rights practices in more than 100 countries. In her introductory essay, Executive Director Tirana Hassan says that 2023 was a consequential year not only for human rights suppression and wartime atrocities but also for selective government outrage and transactional diplomacy that carried profound costs for the rights of those not in on the deal. But she says there were also signs of hope, showing the possibility of a different path, and calls on governments to consistently uphold their human rights obligations.

Governments’ double standards in applying the human rights framework not only put countless lives at risk, but they chip away at trust in the institutions responsible for enforcing and protecting rights, Human Rights Watch said. When governments are vocal in condemning the Israeli government’s war crimes against civilians in Gaza but silent when it comes to Chinese government crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, or demand international prosecution for Russian war crimes in Ukraine while undermining accountability for US abuses in Afghanistan, they weaken the belief in the universality of human rights and the legitimacy of the laws designed to protect them.

Governments have found it easier to disregard human rights issues in the international arena in part because their violations of human rights at home have gone unchallenged by the international community, Human Rights Watch said.

The human rights and humanitarian crises have led many to question the effectiveness of the human rights framework, when abusive governments are able to benefit from the lukewarm endorsement of a rights approach by more democratic and rights-respecting governments, Human Rights Watch said. Civil society organizations, grassroots movements, and human rights defenders can help to re-establish the human rights framework as the roadmap to building thriving, inclusive societies.

Many governments that condemned Hamas’ war crimes have been reserved in responding to those by the Israeli government. The unwillingness to call out Israeli government abuses follows from the United States and most European Union member countries’ refusal to urge an end to the Israeli government’s 16-year closure of Gaza.

Tradeoffs on human rights in the name of politics are clear when many governments fail to speak out about the Chinese government’s intensifying repression. Chinese authorities’ cultural persecution and arbitrary detention of a million Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims amount to crimes against humanity, yet many governments, including in predominantly Muslim countries, stay silent.

In Sudan, which descended into armed conflict in April 2023 when the two most powerful Sudanese generals began battling each other for power, the United Nations has failed to stop massive abuses against civilians, most notably in the Darfur region. The UN Security Council closed its political mission in Sudan at the insistence of the Sudanese government, ending what little remained of the UN’s in-country capacity to protect civilians and publicly report on the rights situation. It has also done nearly nothing to tackle the Sudanese government’s intransigence in cooperating with the International Criminal Court (ICC).

In the US, President Joe Biden has shown little appetite to hold responsible human rights abusers who are key to his domestic agenda or those in China's sphere of influence. US allies like Saudi Arabia, India, and Egypt continue to violate the rights of their people on a massive scale.

The EU has circumvented its human rights obligations, pushing asylum seekers and migrants back to other countries or striking deals with abusive governments like Libya and Turkey to keep migrants out. Democratic governments in the Asia-Pacific region, including Japan, South Korea, and Australia consistently deprioritize human rights in the name of assuring military alliances and trade.

Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India’s democracy has slid toward autocracy, with authorities targeting minorities, tightening repression, and dismantling independent institutions.

In Tunisia, President Kais Saied has eliminated checks and balances. El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele has manipulated high levels of crime for a security crackdown to grab and consolidate power. In Bangladesh, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government ordered the arrest of over 10,000 opposition leaders and supporters ahead of the January 2024 election.

But just as these threats are interconnected, so too is the power of the human rights framework to protect people’s freedom and dignity.

In a milestone decision, in November, the International Court of Justice ordered the Syrian government to prevent torture and other abuses. The Japanese parliament passed its first law to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people from “unfair discrimination.” In Mexico, a civil society coalition persuaded Congress to pass a law establishing full legal capacity, benefiting millions of people with disabilities and older people.

In March, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and his children’s rights commissioner for war crimes relating to the forcible transfer of children from occupied territories of Ukraine to Russia. Brazil’s Supreme Court upheld all Indigenous peoples’ rights to their traditional lands, one of the most effective barriers against deforestation in the Amazon.

And in November, the United Kingdom’s highest court unanimously found that Rwanda is not a safe third country for the government to send asylum seekers, striking down an agreement that effectively shifted the UK’s asylum responsibilities to Rwanda.

“Human rights crises around the world demonstrate the urgency of applying longstanding and mutually agreed principles of international human rights law everywhere,” Hassan said. “Principled diplomacy, by which governments center their human rights obligations in their relations with other countries, can influence oppressive conduct and have a meaningful impact for people whose rights are being violated.”",HIGH,20240111T160000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Tirana Hassan, various global leaders and governments",Various Governments,"Israel, Gaza, Ukraine, Myanmar, Ethiopia, Sahel, Sudan, various countries","Uphold human rights consistently, prioritize human rights in diplomatic relations",Failure to protect and uphold human rights during crises,Global,"Armed conflicts, economic inequality, governmental repression, transactional diplomacy"

On January 10, a Myanmar military court closed to the public sentenced award-winning documentary filmmaker Shin Daewe to life in prison on trumped-up terrorism charges. Her conviction and harsh sentencing is the latest example of the Myanmar junta’s relentless persecution of the media.

Police arrested Shin Daewe, 50, on October 15 after finding her with an aerial drone. Though drones are often used by journalists, their possession is illegal in Myanmar. She was charged under Myanmar’s draconian Counterterrorism Law of 2014 – which the junta has sharpened into a tool of oppression – for “financing and abetting terrorism,” and received the maximum punishment, characteristic of the junta-controlled courts.

Speaking to local media, Shin Daewe's husband said that the police held her for almost two weeks in an unknown location before transferring her to Yangon’s Insein prison. He said that prison sources told him she appeared to have welts and bruises on her arms and stitches on her head, which suggested she was badly beaten in custody.

Other journalists have been convicted in summary trials since the junta seized power in a February 2021 coup. On September 6, 2023, a military tribunal convicted a Myanmar Now journalist on various charges including sedition and sentenced him to 20 years in prison. Military authorities arrested Sai Zaw Thaike, 40, in Rakhine State on May 26 as he covered the aftermath of Cyclone Mocha.

Like Shin Daewe, Sai Zaw Thaike was held in Insein prison and denied access to legal representation, in violation of basic international due process standards. Both journalists were sentenced by military tribunals in closed proceedings.

In violation of the right to freedom of expression, Myanmar junta members have repeatedly attacked the media for independent or critical reporting. The rights group Assistance Association for Political Prisoners reported that the military continues to wrongfully detain at least 61 journalists among the more than 19,900 people it has rounded up since the coup.

The unfair trials and cruel sentences handed down to Shin Daewe and Sai Zaw Thaike are part of a broader effort to instill fear in the junta’s critics, suppress independent coverage, and deny the reality of the military’s serious and ongoing rights violations.

Alexei Navalny’s death in prison is a stark reminder of the lawless barbarity of Vladimir Putin’s dictatorship.

No one needed any reminding.

That the Kremlin bears responsibility for the Russian opposition leader’s death is as obvious as it is grim. For years, they persecuted Navalny viciously and imprisoned him on politically motivated charges.

He’d been behind bars since he returned to Russia in 2021, following medical treatment after surviving a poisoning attempt the year before. In 2023, authorities invented additional charges, and they sentenced Navalny to 19 more years in prison. They confined him in punishment cells for most of the time he was in custody, including in the days before his death.

With every step the Kremlin-controlled courts and other authorities took against Navalny, their intent was clear: to ensure the opposition leader remained incarcerated and isolated as long as possible.

Only, their plan didn’t quite work. Their non-stop injustice didn’t silence Navalny, and he remained a thorn in the Kremlin’s side. Just a couple weeks ago, he called for a creative protest at next month’s presidential “elections” show in Russia, hoping people would appear at polling centers en masse at the same time to express discontent with Putin’s dictatorship.

You may say Navalny’s fate is unsurprising – in fact, he more or less predicted it himself, sending a message to his supporters, and to all Russians, in 2022 about what they must do in the event of his death: “You’re not allowed to give up.”

And you can say Navalny’s death in prison tells us nothing we don’t already know about Putin’s regime. What can anyone expect from the authorities behind the imprisonment of opposition politician Vladimir Kara-Murza, the persecution of human rights hero Oleg Orlov, and countless other moves to crush all criticism and dissent in recent years – and for many years before, too.

The murder of Russian investigative journalist and human rights defender Anna Politkovskaya in 2006 was an early warning of what Putin’s Russia was becoming.

And the families of civilians slaughtered by Russia’s years of bombing in Syria or in its atrocity-ridden invasion and occupation of Ukraine – they need no further convincing of the inhumanity at the core of the Kremlin’s actions. Nor does the International Criminal Court, which has issued arrest warrants for Putin and another government official for mass child abductions in Ukraine.

However, the fact no one is surprised by Navalny’s death in Putin’s dictatorship, does not make it any less appalling.

Australian lawmakers attending Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s address before a joint sitting of parliament in Canberra on Wednesday should take his human rights rhetoric with a grain of salt.

Australian-Philippine relations have improved since President Marcos took office in 2022, replacing Rodrigo Duterte, whose abusive “war on drugs” killed thousands and amounted to crimes against humanity. In September, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited Manila and signed an agreement establishing a strategic partnership between the two countries.

But human rights violations in the Philippines remain rampant. Drug-related killings implicating the police have continued under Marcos, if at a lower rate. The government refuses to cooperate with the International Criminal Court’s investigation into the “war on drugs.” Arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings of activists and human rights defenders persist. Government officials and the security forces continue the dangerous practice of ""red-tagging,"" publicly branding leftist activists and politicians as members or supporters of the communist insurgency, putting them at higher risk of abuse.

Australia’s Labor government should be especially concerned by the rising harassment and violence against labor leaders and union organizers in the Philippines. Albanese should urge Marcos to act to stop these abuses and thoroughly investigate recent killings.

In September, police shot and killed labor leader Jude Thaddeus Fernandez at his home in the town of Binangonan in Rizal province. The officers claim Fernandez “fought back” while being served with a search warrant, without explaining why his home was being searched or why he resisted. Fernandez’s colleagues told Human Rights Watch they believe police were using the commonly used defense of nanlaban (fighting back) to justify killing him.

Marcos’s visit to Australia is an important opportunity for Australia’s leaders to address well-documented human rights abuses in the Philippines. Ignoring them will only embolden Marcos and the prevailing culture of impunity. The people of the Philippines deserve more than warm words and empty rhetoric when it comes to respecting and upholding their human rights.",HIGH,20240227T221500Z,Human Rights Watch,Labor leader Jude Thaddeus Fernandez,Philippine Government,"Binangonan, Rizal province, Philippines",Australia should press the Philippines to investigate and stop human rights abuses.,"Human rights violations including extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests, and enforced disappearances.",Philippines,"Government policies of red-tagging, culture of impunity, and continuation of violent drug-related enforcement."

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese should focus on human rights concerns and democratic backsliding at the upcoming summit with Southeast Asian leaders.

Human rights conditions have worsened in ASEAN countries in recent years, and ASEAN as an organization has done little to address key crises among its members.

Key concerns include the need for stronger sanctions against Myanmar and ending attacks on dissidents in Cambodia and Vietnam, and security forces’ targeting of activists in the Philippines.

(Sydney) – Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese should focus on human rights concerns and democratic backsliding at the upcoming summit with Southeast Asian leaders, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. Albanese will host leaders from nine of the countries making up the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) at the ASEAN-Australia Special Summit on March 4 to 6, 2024, in Melbourne.

The 60-page report, “Human Rights in Southeast Asia,” summarizes critical human rights issues that Albanese should raise at the summit. Human Rights Watch urged the Australian government to put its values as a rights-respecting democracy at the core of its relations with ASEAN countries. As the Australian government approaches the summit with the goal of removing blockages to regional economic cooperation, it should not bypass human rights concerns in the hopes that they will resolve themselves, because they will not.

“This high-level meeting would be a lost opportunity for Australia and the people of ASEAN countries if the Australian government were to gloss over human rights issues,” said Daniela Gavshon, Australia director at Human Rights Watch. “The Australian government should send the message that human rights violations are a key foreign policy concern.”

It will be especially important for Australia to guide discussion toward human rights since the subject has been left off the summit agenda.

The summit marks 50 years of ASEAN-Australia dialogue relations. Over the past five decades, successive Australian governments have pursued closer economic, security, and political partnerships with ASEAN countries. Australia continues to strengthen its ties with Southeast Asian countries to offset the shift in global power dynamics.

United States influence in the region is being challenged by the growing political, economic, and military clout of a more assertive China. To counter China’s threat to human rights and the rules-based international order, Australia should center its dialogue with ASEAN leaders on the rights of Southeast Asian people rather than just on strengthening friendly relations.

The anniversary presents a unique opportunity to reflect on human rights in the region and to reframe the next 50 years of Australia-ASEAN cooperation. Albanese has already projected the next half-century to be “even more successful than the last” for ASEAN-Australia relations, and pledged A$95.4 million (US$63.9 million) to kick-start Australia’s Southeast Asia Economic Strategy to 2040.

In a February letter, Human Rights Watch urged Prime Minister Albanese to press for commitments from individual countries at the summit, and raise specific human rights issues with individual governments.

“Human rights conditions have worsened in ASEAN countries in recent years and ASEAN as an organization has done little to address key crises among its members,” Gavshon said. “Australia’s failure to directly address human rights concerns at the summit would be a propaganda coup for abusive leaders, and it will embolden new ASEAN leaders to continue the human rights abusing legacies of their predecessors.”

In its most serious human rights lapse, ASEAN has not dealt with the spiralling humanitarian and human rights crisis in Myanmar. The consequences have spilled over the borders of Thailand, India, and China, and contributed to the continued suffering of ethnic Rohingya who have fled to Bangladesh. Tens of thousands have sought safety in neighboring countries since the 2021 coup by the Myanmar military. In addition, Rohingya who fled crimes against humanity and acts of genocide in 2017 cannot return. Given increasing insecurity and deteriorating conditions in the camps housing one million Rohingya in Bangladesh, 4,500 made the high-risk sea voyage to Indonesia or Malaysia in 2023, according to the United Nations refugee agency.

ASEAN’s Five-Point Consensus – which Myanmar’s junta repudiated days after agreeing to it in April 2021 – is not a viable framework for dealing with a military that continues to commit crimes against humanity and war crimes. Australian and ASEAN governments should agree to enforce sanctions against Myanmar, including those newly imposed by Australia on banks and jet fuel suppliers, in their own jurisdictions. Together, Albanese and Southeast Asian leaders should commit to strengthening multilateral action at the UN Security Council.

Among other key rights issues to be addressed is the Thai and Cambodian governments’ cooperation to uncover, intimidate, and arrest Cambodian civil society activists in Thailand. In Vietnam, the government systematically suppresses freedom of expression and other basic liberties. In the Philippines, the security forces target activists, rights defenders, and journalists, often with deadly results.

State-sponsored discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in Singapore, Indonesia, and Malaysia remains pervasive. On an institutional level, ASEAN purports to respect the human rights of its 685 million citizens. However, its Human Rights Declaration and ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR) have no real impact.

In its capacity as summit host, the Australian government can direct conversations with a human rights focus. It can encourage openness by acknowledging the deficiencies in its own domestic rights record. This forthright approach will send the message that strong diplomatic relations still thrive without condoning or covering up allies’ human rights concerns, Human Rights Watch said.

An ongoing court case in the Maldives sheds light on why it is so hard to get the government to enforce the country’s environmental laws.

The Maldives is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to the consequences of climate change, with 80 percent of the archipelago’s islands less than a meter above sea level. The government has enacted significant environmental legislation, most notably the Environment Protection and Preservation Act, which mandates Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) for all development projects.

The act stipulates that EIAs must be carried out before development projects can be approved. However, government ministries often preapprove projects, rendering EIAs little more than box-ticking exercises. A former official from the Maldives Environmental Protection Agency told Human Rights Watch that once EIAs are published for a particular project, officials often reject most of the recommendations.

These issues are being played out in Maldives courts in the case of the Gulhifalhu reclamation project. In 2019, the Maldives government awarded the project to the Dutch construction company Boskalis without any formal tendering process, in a deal reportedly worth US$53 million. Six months later, the authorities released an EIA that revealed that the project could cause irreversible environmental damage. The decision to proceed with the project had been made prior to the completion of the EIA.

In 2021, climate activist Humaida Abdul Gafoor filed a case against the government on the grounds that the reclamation project risked causing serious economic, environmental, and cultural harm to the local community.

Earlier this month, climate activists were encouraged when the high court issued an injunction to suspend work on the reclamation project with immediate effect, pending a final ruling in the case. However, the government immediately appealed the injunction to the Supreme Court, arguing that a halt would cause severe financial losses to the project. The Supreme Court lifted the injunction, allowing work on the project to continue.

The case can still proceed to the merits, even as the reclamation continues to cause harm. But importantly it has already put the government on notice that if it wants this and similar projects to continue, it will be subjecting its lax enforcement of the country’s environmental protection laws not only to judicial scrutiny, but to the scrutiny of the Maldives public and beyond.

Instead, the Maldives government should be championing its environmental protection laws and minimizing the environmental damage caused by development projects.",HIGH,20240229T161500Z,Humaida Abdul Gafoor,Humaida Abdul Gafoor,Maldives government,Gulhifalhu,Champion environmental protection laws and minimize environmental damage from projects.,Lax enforcement of environmental protection laws,Maldives,"Lack of adherence to environmental legislation, preapproval of projects without EIAs"

(Moscow) – A Russian court sentenced one of the country’s top human rights leaders, Oleg Orlov, to 2 years and 6 months in prison, on charges of “discrediting” Russia’s armed forces in what was clearly a farcical trial, Human Rights Watch said today.

Orlov, 70, is the co-chair of Memorial, one of Russia’s leading human rights groups and one of three recipients of the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize. The charges against him stem from an article he published in 2022, alleging that Russia was descending into fascism.

In October 2023, a court fined Orlov on a “repeated discreditation” charge. Orlov appealed the verdict, and the prosecutor’s office counter-appealed, charging him with an aggravated “discrediting” offense, after which the case was sent to retrial.

The following quote can be attributed to Tanya Lokshina, associate Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch:

South Sudan: As elections loom, extend vital Human Rights Commission mandate

Excellencies,

Ahead of the UN Human Rights Coun­cil’s (“HRC” or “Coun­­cil”) 55th session (26 Feb­­ruary-5 April 2024), we, the undersigned non-governmental orga­nisa­tions, write to urge your delegation to sup­port a full extension of the mandate of the UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan (here­after “CHRSS” or “Commission”).

As South Sudan is preparing for its first-ever national elections, in December 2024, significant con­cerns exist not only about the country’s human rights si­tuation but also about the absence of key conditions for the holding of free, fair, secure, and credible elections and about the absence of an enabling environment for civil society. In this context, international scrutiny remains vital.

As 95 organisations highlighted in a letter released ahead of the Council’s 52nd session,[1] the CHRSS is the only mechanism tasked with collecting and preserving evidence of vio­la­tions of in­ter­­­na­tional huma­ni­tarian and human rights law with a view to ensuring accountability and ad­dres­sing human rights issues in South Sudan from a holistic perspective. Its work, including advisory functions, remains vital as the conditions that prompted the HRC to establish the Commission, in 2016, have not significantly changed. Until there is meaningful and genuine progress, there is no reason for the Council to lift its scrutiny.

We stress that all elements of the CH­RSS’s mandate should be preserved. Any change to it, or to the level of scrutiny the Council dedicates to South Sudan in addition to the advisory services it provides as per resolution 52/1,[2] would send the wrong message. The Commission’s man­date should at the very least cover the entirety of the transi­tio­nal period,[3] after which an assessment should be made again whether the conditions that prompted the establishment of the Commission have changed to warrant a new approach.

Violence and impunity remain per­va­sive in the country. All trends and patterns outlined in previous civil society letters[4] continue. Our orga­ni­sations note the lack of structural impro­vements with the utmost concern. On­going violations and abuses include extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings, serious vio­lations of international hu­ma­nitarian law that may amount to cri­mes under inter­na­tional law, politi­cally instigated and sup­por­ted violence between commu­nity-based militias and vigilante groups, egregious violations of women’s and girls’ human rights, including sexual and gen­der-based violence (SGBV) and conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV), arbitrary arrests, and intimidation of, threats against, and harass­ment of ci­vil so­ciety actors, including human rights defenders and journalists,[5] in a climate of wide­spread impu­nity. Loca­lised conflicts and intercom­mu­nal vio­len­ce remain perva­sive in parts of Warrap State, Eastern, Central and Western Equatoria States, Greater Upper Nile State, Greater Jonglei, and Unity State, as well as in the admi­nis­trative regions of Abyei and Pibor. In May 2023, the UN Security Council extended the arms embargo on South Sudan. Implementation of the five benchmarks that serve as a basis for the UN Sec­re­tary-Ge­ne­ral’s assessment[6] has been null or limited.

The humanitarian crisis remains severe. Across the country, conflict, including attacks against huma­ni­tarian workers and theft of food supplies, climate change, and soaring costs are causing “some of the high­est levels of hunger in the world.”[7] In 2023, 9.4 million people (or over 85% of the population) were in need of aid. As of 22 January 2024, the funding gap for humanitarian aid is 1.7 billion US dollars.[8]

The cross-border impact of the conflict in Sudan is also “exacerbating existing trig­gers and drivers of conflict across South Sudan […] amid competition over scarce resources, economic hardship, pre-exis­ting communal tensions, and the presence of firearms,” which adds to the much wider “patchwork of intercommunal and subnational conflict.”[9]

Ten years after the onset of South Sudan’s conflict, which claimed over 400,000 lives and displaced mil­lions, justice remains elusive for the victims and survivors. Progress with regard to accountability re­mains extremely li­mited.[10] The con­­tinuation of the CHRSS’s mandate is the best means to safeguard prospects for future account­ability, including through the Hybrid Court for South Sudan (HCSS), whose establishment con­ti­nues to be para­lysed.[11] The other transitional justice mechanisms envisioned in Chap­ter V of the peace agreement, namely the Commission for Truth, Recon­ci­liation and Healing (CTRH) and the Compensation and Reparation Authority (CRA), have not been established.

Ten months before South Sudan’s first national elections, uncertainty over the constitution-making and elec­toral pro­cess is high. Critical questions remain unanswered, including on the type of election, voter registration issues, deli­nea­ting constituencies, and managing electoral disputes. Foundational tasks necessary for citizens to head to the polls are incomplete. Among them, the need to reconstitute the National Constitutional Review Com­mission, the National Elections Com­mission, and the Political Par­ties Council. Transitional security arrangements as per the R-ARCSS are lagging behind sche­dule.[12] On 14 December 2023, the head of the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), Nicholas Haysom, sounded the alarm. He said that “South Sudan is in no position to hold free, fair, or secure elections […].” Stressing that a “critical mass of pre-requisites” is necessary to hold free, fair, and credible elections, he mentioned the absence of a permanent Constitution, voter registration details, an election security plan, well trained, equipped, and unified security forces, and a mechanism for resolving disputes over results.[13]

As the CHRSS highlighted in a conference room paper, “holding elections without addressing security concerns, creating an enabling environment, and completing the technical arrangements risks compound­ding grievances and fuelling fur­ther violence.”[14] The Commission added: “It is […] troubling that [ruling] SPLM-IG leaders have continued to emphasise the urgency of elections to end the transition period, and its power-sharing arrangements, which they have increasingly portrayed as a political encumbrance. They envisage a ‘winner takes all’ outcome […]. A context in which elections become a zero-sum exercise inc­rea­ses the political stakes and foments a recourse to irregularities and even violence, as the loss of elec­tions represents the margina­li­sation of whole constituencies […].”[15]

Beyond logistical preparations, an enabling environment for free, fair, and credible elections, inclu­ding an open civic space, is also lacking. To address this, “entrenched patterns of disruption and inter­ference with citizens’ freedoms of assembly, association and expression must be abandoned […].”[16]

In practice, however, South Sudanese civil so­ciety, including human rights defenders (HRDs) and jour­na­lists and media workers, has been facing inten­sifying repression. This includes undue res­tric­tions on their rights to freedoms of opinion and expression, peaceful assembly, and association. Independent actors face harassment, intimidation, sur­veil­­lance, arbitrary bureaucratic controls, censorship, threats, phy­sical assault, arbi­trary arrests and deten­tions, inc­luding incommunicado detention and extraordinary renditions from other African countries, tor­ture, enforced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings. Wo­men HRDs and journalists face additional gender-spe­cific threats, including sexual violence, in the con­text of reprisals.[17] The National Security Service (NSS), whose mandate should urgently be brought in line with interna­tional human rights law and the 2011 Transitional Constitution through amendments to the NSS Act, is a key instrument of repression.[18] As the Commission summed up in its last conference room paper, “[a]s South Sudan contemplates a period of elections and constitution-making, the impartial and cons­truc­tive role of the NSS will be a critical litmus test of the credibility of those processes.”[19]

This is not the time to relax the Council’s scrutiny. The mandate of the CHRSS remains vital and should continue until the reasons that led the Council to establish this mechanism have been ad­dress­ed in a meaningful manner.

The Council should request the CHRSS:

To present a comprehensive written report on the situation of human rights in South Sudan to it at its 58th session, to be followed by an enhanced interactive dialogue;

To present an oral update to the Council at its 57th session; and

To share its reports and recommendations with relevant bodies and mechanisms of the African Union and all relevant organs of the United Nations, and to submit a comprehensive report to the General Assembly at its 79th session, to be followed by an interactive dialogue

(The Hague, February 26, 2024) – The Israeli government has failed to comply with at least one measure in the legally binding order from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in South Africa’s genocide case, Human Rights Watch said today. Citing warnings about “catastrophic conditions” in Gaza, the court ordered Israel on January 26, 2024, to “take immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian aid,” and to report back on its compliance to the specific measures “within one month.”

One month later, however, Israel continues to obstruct the provision of basic services and the entry and distribution within Gaza of fuel and lifesaving aid, acts of collective punishment that amount to war crimes and include the use of starvation of civilians as a weapon of war. Fewer trucks have entered Gaza and fewer aid missions have been permitted to reach northern Gaza in the several weeks since the ruling than in the weeks preceding it, according to United Nations Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

“The Israeli government is starving Gaza’s 2.3 million Palestinians, putting them in even more peril than before the World Court’s binding order,” said Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch. “The Israeli government has simply ignored the court’s ruling, and in some ways even intensified its repression, including further blocking lifesaving aid.”

Other countries should use all forms of leverage, including sanctions and embargoes, to press the Israeli government to comply with the court’s binding orders in the genocide case, Human Rights Watch said.

Human Rights Watch found in December 2023 that Israeli authorities are using starvation as a weapon of war. Pursuant a policy set out by Israeli officials and carried out by Israeli forces, the Israeli authorities are deliberately blocking the delivery of water, food, and fuel, willfully impeding humanitarian assistance, apparently razing agricultural areas, and depriving the civilian population of objects indispensable to its survival.

Israeli authorities have kept its supply of electricity for Gaza shut off since the October 7 Hamas-led attacks. After initially cutting the entire supply of water that Israel provides to Gaza via three pipelines, Israel resumed piping on two of its three lines. However, due to the cuts and widespread destruction to water infrastructure amid unrelenting Israeli air and ground operations, only one of those lines remained operational at only 47 percent capacity as of February 20. Officials at the Gaza Coastal Municipalities Water Utility told Human Rights Watch on February 20 that Israeli authorities have obstructed efforts to repair the water infrastructure.

According to data published by OCHA and the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), the daily average number of trucks entering Gaza with food, aid, and medicine dropped by more than a third in the weeks following the ICJ ruling: 93 trucks between January 27 and February 21, 2024, compared to 147 trucks between January 1 and 26, and only 57 between February 9 and 21. A survey of impediments to the entry of aid faced by 24 humanitarian organizations operating in Gaza between January 26 and February 15 pointed to a lack of transparency around how aid trucks can enter Gaza, delays and denials at Israeli crossings and inspection points, and concerns about safety of trucks.

By comparison, an average of 500 trucks of food and goods entered Gaza each day before the escalation in hostilities in October, during which time 1.2 million people in Gaza were estimated to be facing acute food insecurity , and 80 percent of Gaza’s population were reliant on humanitarian aid amid Israel's more than 16-year-long unlawful closure.



High-ranking Israeli officials have articulated a policy to deprive civilians of food, water, and fuel, as Human Rights Watch has documented. The Israeli government spokesperson said more recently that there are “no limits” to aid entering Gaza, outside of security. Some Israeli officials blame the UN for distribution delays and accuse Hamas of diverting aid or Gaza police for failing to secure convoys.

The Israeli government cannot shift blame to evade responsibility, Human Rights Watch said. As the occupying power, Israel is obliged to provide for the welfare of the occupied population and ensure that the humanitarian needs of Gaza’s population are met. The Israeli human rights group Gisha challenged the Israeli government’s claims that it is not obstructing entry or distribution of aid and also found that it is not complying with the ICJ order.

Israeli authorities have also obstructed the aid that enters Gaza from reaching areas in the north. The survey of humanitarian organizations found that “almost no aid is distributed beyond Rafah,” Gaza’s southernmost governorate. On February 20, the World Food Programme paused deliveries of lifesaving food to the north, citing lack of safety and security. Israeli forces struck a food convoy on February 5, the UN said and CNN documented.

Between February 1 and 15, Israeli authorities only facilitated 2 of 21 planned missions to deliver fuel to the north of the Wadi Gaza area in central Gaza and none of the 16 planned fuel delivery or assessment missions to water and wastewater pumping stations in the north. Fewer than 20 percent of planned missions to deliver fuel and undertake assessments north of Wadi Gaza have been facilitated between January 1 and February 15, as compared with 86 percent of missions planned between October and December, according to OCHA.

“Israel’s ground forces are able to reach all parts of Gaza, so Israeli authorities clearly have the capacity to ensure that aid reaches all of Gaza,” Shakir said.

Since the ICJ order, Israeli authorities have also apparently destroyed the offices of at least two humanitarian organizations in Gaza and taken steps to undermine the work of UNRWA, the largest provider of humanitarian aid in Gaza, which more than half of other humanitarian organizations rely on to facilitate their operations. The head of UNWRA, Philippe Lazarini, said in a February 22 letter to the UN General Assembly president that the agency has reached a “breaking point” due to multiple government suspensions of funding and Israel’s campaign to shut the agency down.

Israel’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said on February 13 that he had blocked a US-funded flour shipment to Gaza, because it was going to UNRWA. Israel has alleged that at least 12 of the agency’s 30,000 employees participated in the October 7 attacks, which the UN is investigating.

In late December, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a multi-partner initiative that regularly publishes information on the scale and severity of food insecurity and malnutrition globally, concluded that over 90 percent of Gaza’s population is at crisis level of acute food insecurity or worse. The IPC said that virtually all Palestinians in Gaza are skipping meals every day while many adults go hungry so children can eat, and that the population faced famine if current conditions persisted. “This is the highest share of people facing high levels of acute food insecurity that the IPC initiative has ever classified for any given area or country,” the group said.

On February 19, The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) found that 90 percent of children under age 2 and 95 percent of pregnant and breastfeeding women face “severe food poverty.” On February 22, Save the Children said families in Gaza “are forced to forage for scraps of food left by rats and eating leaves out of desperation to survive,” noting that “all 1.1 million children in Gaza [are] facing starvation.”

In response to a request by South Africa for additional provisional measures following Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s order for Israeli authorities to explore a possible plan to evacuate Rafah ahead of a ground incursion, the ICJ said that the “perilous situation demands immediate and effective implementation of the provisional measures” throughout Gaza – but not new measures – and highlighted Israel’s duty to ensure “the safety and security of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.”

Beyond enabling the provision of basic services and aid, the measures in the ICJ’s binding order require Israel to prevent genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and prevent and punish incitement to commit genocide. The ICJ issued these measures “to protect the rights claimed by South Africa that the Court has found to be plausible,” including “the right of the Palestinians in Gaza to be protected from acts of genocide.” Although South Africa asked the court in its oral arguments during January hearings on the provisional measures to make any report it ordered public, the court did not indicate that it has done so.

Between January 26 and February 23, more than 3,400 Palestinians were killed in Gaza, according to figures from Gaza’s Health Ministry compiled by OCHA.

South Africa’s case against Israel for genocide is distinct from the proceedings on the legal consequences of Israel’s 57-year-occupation, which began at the ICJ on February 19.

“Israel’s blatant disregard for the World Court’s order poses a direct challenge to the rules-based international order,” Shakir said. “Failure to ensure Israel’s compliance puts the lives of millions of Palestinians at risk and threatens to undermine the institutions charged with ensuring respect for international law and the system that ensures civilian protection worldwide.”",VERY HIGH,20240226T074500Z,Human Rights Watch,Omar Shakir (Human Rights Watch director),Israeli government,Gaza,"International sanctions and embargoes against Israel for non-compliance with ICJ orders, calls for better transparency and safety for humanitarian assistance",Failure to comply with ICJ order regarding provision of humanitarian aid and services; use of starvation as a weapon of war,Israel,"Long-term occupation of Gaza, ongoing conflict, policy decisions by Israeli officials regarding aid access"

(New York) – The Chinese authorities should immediately release hundreds of Tibetan monks and villagers who were detained while peacefully protesting the construction of a hydroelectric dam in China’s western Sichuan province, Human Rights Watch said today. The dam, which will generate electricity for eastern China, will submerge historic monasteries and numerous Tibetan villages.

“The Chinese authorities have long been hostile to public protests, but their response is especially brutal when the protests are by Tibetans and other ethnic groups,” said Maya Wang, acting China director at Human Rights Watch. “Other governments should press Beijing to free these protesters, who have been wrongfully detained for exercising their basic rights.”

Reports from Radio Free Asia say that at least 300 villagers travelled to Derge county government in Sichuan province on February 14, 2024, to protest the building of the Kamtok (Tibetan: sKam thog, Chinese: Gangtuo) dam. Video footage obtained by Tibetan exile media and confirmed by Human Rights Watch shows villagers from the area of Wontoe (Tibetan: dBon po stod, Chinese: Wangbuding) protesting the dam’s construction. The dam is the sixth in a proposed series of 13 on the Dri Chu (Tibetan: ’Bri chu) River, known as Jinsha or the upper Yangtse River in Chinese.

Severe reprisals by the authorities in Tibetan areas of China have meant that protests – at least those publicly known – are rare. Extensive restrictions on communications make it difficult and dangerous to organize and publicize such events.

On February 20 and 21, teams of county officials and police arrived at two monasteries in Wontoe township in preparation for their demolition as part of the construction of the Kamtok dam. Yena monastery in Shiba village and Wontoe monastery in Wontoe village are cultural landmarks believed to date back over 700 years, and the mural paintings in the monasteries have historical importance.

Monks and villagers, including the bursar of Wontoe monastery, peacefully appealed to the authorities for dialogue. The following day, the police beat and detained large numbers of those who were part of the protest. Informants told Radio Free Asia that the police told detainees to bring food and bedding from home, indicating that their detention would be long. Community members who visited the detention centers to appeal for the detainees’ release were themselves detained.

Exile media sources have obtained and published other citizen videos that show the protests and subsequent detentions, which Human Rights Watch was unable to independently verify. While the videos provide a rare glimpse into the situation in Tibetan areas, they also heighten fears that people accused of sending the videos abroad will face severe punishment.

Five major hydroelectric dams are already in operation or under construction along this stretch of the river, with an installed capacity of 8.6 gigawatts. By comparison, the world’s most powerful hydro dam, the Three Gorges, lower down the Yangtse River, has a generating capacity of 22.5 gigawatts. All of this electricity is sent from Tibetan areas through the Ultra High Voltage “West to East” (xi dian dong song) transmission infrastructure, due to be completed by 2025.

Since 2017, authorities have relocated over 11,000 people from 7 townships in Gonjo and Markham counties bordering the Jinsha River for “poverty alleviation” reasons, according to official figures, though such reports do not link the mass relocation to dam construction.

The right to protections against forced eviction derives from the right to adequate housing as provided under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, to which China is a state party. According to the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which monitors state compliance with the covenant, for evictions to be lawful they must be “solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society,” and carried out “in strict compliance with the relevant provisions of international human rights law and in accordance with general principles of reasonableness and proportionality.”

These safeguards include, for example, that the government explores “all feasible alternatives” prior to eviction, and that it provides an opportunity for genuine consultation with those affected. Mass evictions carried out in Tibetan areas often have not met these basic standards, Human Rights Watch said.

“The Chinese authorities’ mass arbitrary detention of peaceful protesters highlights grave concerns about the effects of further dam construction on Tibetans’ heritage, culture, and livelihoods,” Wang said. “The government needs to view genuine participation by the affected population as essential for carrying out major infrastructure projects.”",HIGH,20240228T043000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Maya Wang, acting China director at Human Rights Watch",Chinese authorities,"Derge county, Sichuan province, China","Genuine participation of affected populations, repeal of arbitrary detentions, respect for basic rights of protesters",Mass arbitrary detention of peaceful protesters,China,"Construction of hydropower dam, severe reprisals against Tibetan protests"

“You’re a brat, aren’t you? You’re like a child.”

The public prosecutor’s words fill the stark interrogation room in Yokohama, Japan. Yamato Eguchi sits silently and almost motionless, alone opposite the prosecutor across a plain metal desk, eyes closed and with his back against a blank wall.

“You’re just annoying. You’re just a pain in the ass.”

The prosecutor’s rain of verbal abuse and humiliation continues for 56 hours over 21 days.

At one point, he pulls out Eguchi’s middle school grades.

“It looks like you weren’t very good at math, science, or any science stuff.”

None of this has anything to do with the charge against Eguchi, who in 2018 was a lawyer accused of inducing his client to make a false statement regarding a car accident. The blast of berating and belittling seems to be the point in of itself.

And this is typical in Japan. Regular Daily Brief readers may recall our look at Japan’s “hostage justice system” – hitojichi-shiho – in which you are essentially considered guilty as soon as you’re a suspect in detention, long before any trial even begins.

The authorities undermine your most basic rights. They try to strip you of the right to remain silent, they question you without your lawyer present, and they coerce you to confess by denying you bail. They frequently detain you prior to trial for ages — sometimes for months or even more than a year — to badger confessions out of you, whether you’re guilty or not.

But what is unusual in Eguchi’s case is that there’s a video of the abusive interrogation. Eguchi brought a lawsuit against the government, demanding state redress for what he endured while in custody in 2018. Some of the video recordings of Eguchi’s interrogations were played in court a few weeks ago, and they’re now on YouTube for the world to see (with English subtitles even).

It has sparked public outrage in Japan. And rightly so.

So many of the problems built into Japan’s “hostage justice system” are all there in that short set of video clips. In addition to the harangues and insults against Eguchi, the prosecutor laughs at his right to remain silent (the right against self-incrimination). Eguchi has no lawyer there to represent him – he wasn’t allowed one.

These same abusive practices have resulted in countless wrongful convictions and torn apart so many lives and families across Japan.

Hopefully, the video footage and the public outrage will help bring about the reforms Japan’s criminal justice system desperately demands. Japan’s Diet, the national legislature, should urgently bring it into line with international standards: protecting the right against self-incrimination, for example, and allowing lawyers to be present during questioning.

The whole approach of Japan’s criminal justice system needs to change in a fundamental way. People should be considered innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. No one should be assumed to be guilty at the outset and then subjected to humiliating abuse for weeks on end.",VERY HIGH,20240227T144500Z,Public Prosecutor,Yamato Eguchi,Yamato Eguchi,"Yokohama, Japan",Urgent reforms to comply with international standards; protecting the right to remain silent; ensuring access to legal representation during questioning.,Inducing a false statement regarding a car accident,Japan,Hostage justice system; lack of legal protections during detention

Mr. President,

We thank the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan for their latest report and update.

We share the Commission’s concerns over “entrenched systematic repression,” including through media censorship, widespread restrictions on civic and political activities, and continued harassment of journalists and human rights defenders.

The authorities are still failing to provide accountability for grave abuses, allowing impunity to fuel further violence, as the Commission has repeatedly highlighted, with civilians bearing the brunt of widespread attacks, state-sponsored extrajudicial killings , systematic sexual violence against women and girls, and the participation of children in armed forces and armed groups.

For example, the authorities have never prosecuted officials accused of instigating and facilitating attacks on civilians and civilian property in villages in Leer, Koch, and Mayendit counties in early 2022, despite the president launching an investigation into these events.

The government has not met critical milestones set out by the 2018 peace agreement to advance accountability. No steps have been taken to establish a hybrid court, and legislation for the establishment of the Commission for Truth, Reconciliation and Healing and for the Compensation and Reparations Authority has yet to be presented before parliament.

In this context of continued impunity fuelling grave abuses, we appeal to members of this Council to support the renewal of the Commission’s mandate.

We would like to ask the Commission to elaborate further on the main obstacles in the justice system thwarting credible accountability for serious violations, including widespread sexual violence.

Thank you.",HIGH,20240301T173000Z,Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan,"President of South Sudan, officials accused of instigating attacks",South Sudanese Authorities,"Leer, Koch, Mayendit counties","Support the renewal of the Commission’s mandate, address obstacles in the justice system","Systematic repression including media censorship, harassment of journalists, and failure to provide accountability for grave abuses",South Sudan,"Entrenched systematic repression, impunity"

Maryam al-Khawaja has spent nearly 13 years relentlessly campaigning for the release of her father, Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, a Danish-Bahraini human rights defender wrongfully serving a life sentence in Bahrain for his peaceful human rights work. In a heartbreaking message on February 19, Maryam announced she’s now also fighting cancer.

Those who know Maryam know that no one fights as fiercely as she does. In that way, she is her father’s daughter. Over the years, she has never given up on her quest for justice to see her father released from prison, where he still fights for his and others’ rights. Last August, he was among the many Bahraini political prisoners who started a hunger strike to protest their inhumane and degrading treatment. Fearing for her father’s life, Maryam tried to board a plane to Bahrain, knowing she risked arrest upon arrival. She and a delegation of leading human rights figures were prevented from boarding.

Unfortunately, neither the Danish government nor the European Union have shown similar determination in fighting for human rights in Bahrain.

Deeming Bahrain to be a “strategic partner” in the region, EU member states have been reluctant to indicate to the Danish government their readiness to support collective action against Bahrain and to make al-Khawaja’s case an “EU case.” Last year, following the prisoners’ hunger strike, EU member states finally agreed to mention Bahrain in a statement at the United Nations, but some EU governments were so reluctant that the final, negotiated language is borderline flattering to Bahrain’s autocratic rulers and includes no reference to political prisoners or their plight.

The Danish government has also been too timid in its actions, both to rally support within the EU and in confronting Bahraini authorities. Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke said on February 27 that he spoke about Khawaja’s case with Bahrain’s foreign minister, but was “not optimistic” about the outcome. He made no reference to what consequences Bahrain’s reluctance to release Khawaja and others will have on its relations with Denmark and the EU. And that’s precisely the problem.

Thirteen years of “private diplomacy” and “human rights dialogues” have done nothing to reunite Maryam and her father.

(New York) – Indian authorities are using threats, excessive force, and internet shutdowns to stop farmers from holding peaceful protests, Human Rights Watch said today. Since mid-February 2024, farmers from Punjab and Haryana states seeking higher prices for their produce have congregated outside India’s capital, New Delhi, to raise their demands.

The protests revive a year-long movement that ended in 2021 after tens of thousands of farmers camped outside New Delhi and obtained the repeal of new agricultural laws. The farmers’ current demands include an expanded list of 23 crops that the government would purchase at a minimum guaranteed price. To prevent the demonstrators from entering the city, the authorities have barricaded highways with cement blocks, metal containers, and barbed wire. Talks between the farmers and the government have been deadlocked.

“The Indian authorities have an obligation to uphold the right to peaceful protest, whoever is taking part and whatever the issue,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The authorities may not threaten or use force against the farmers to deny their right to express their views in a peaceful manner.”

India’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government has repeatedly cracked down on peaceful protests and arrested critics of government policies. In response to the farmers’ protest, the government has urged dialogue. However, the authorities have threatened to revoke demonstrators’ passports and visas, with a police official stating, “We have identified them with CCTV and drone cameras. We will request the ministry of home affairs and the embassy to cancel their visas and passports.”

The authorities also deployed drones and used tear gas shells to disperse gatherings and medical camps. They fired shotguns loaded with metal pellets, which can cause blindness and other serious injury, for crowd control. On February 21, Shubhkaran Singh, a 24-year old farmer, died of a bullet wound to the head after police repeatedly fired on protesting farmers in the area bordering Punjab and Haryana states.

The protesting farmers have taken several measures to counter security force actions, such as flying kites to distract drones, wearing swimming goggles to protect their eyes from tear gas, and using their tractors to pull down barricades.



The Haryana government imposed temporary restrictions on internet services in seven districts in an apparent attempt to disrupt the farmers’ protests, a tactic the Indian government often uses for political purposes. The Global Government Affairs team at X (formerly Twitter) stated that the Indian government issued “executive orders” requiring them to take down specific accounts on February 21. Most of these accounts, including some barred on Facebook, belong to journalists reporting on the protests, farmers union leaders, and others supporting the farmers’ actions.

India is obligated under international human rights law to ensure that internet-based restrictions are provided by law and are a necessary and proportionate response to a specific security concern. In July 2016, the United Nations Human Rights Council condemned measures to intentionally prevent or disrupt access to or dissemination of information online.

BJP supporters have used social media to describe the protesting farmers, many from the Sikh minority community, as “separatists,” a dangerous accusation. In West Bengal state, a BJP leader used a similar slur against a Sikh police officer, leading to strong condemnation by police officers and protests by the Sikh community. The authorities have repeatedly failed to hold to account BJP leaders and supporters who incite violence against religious minority communities, which communal divisions can escalate to a human rights crisis, Human Rights Watch said.

The Indian government should publicly direct the security forces to abide by the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials and take all other necessary steps to ensure that the forces act with restraint, Human Rights Watch said. Protest organizers should take steps to deter their supporters from engaging in violence against members of the public and law enforcement officers.

The 2020 UN guidance on “less-lethal weapons” in law enforcement says, “Multiple projectiles fired at the same time are inaccurate and, in general, their use cannot comply with the principles of necessity and proportionality. Metal pellets, such as those fired from shotguns, should never be used.”

“As India heads into elections, it’s critical for the BJP-led government to act to minimize rather than exacerbate political violence,” Pearson said. “A genuine commitment to human rights and democracy means providing room for dissent, peaceful protest, and political disagreement.”",HIGH,20240301T063000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Shubhkaran Singh (deceased farmer), Elaine Pearson (Asia director at Human Rights Watch)",Indian authorities,"Border between Punjab and Haryana states near New Delhi, India","Direct security forces to abide by international standards, ensure peaceful protests are allowed.","Use of threats, excessive force, and internet shutdowns to stop peaceful protests",India,"Political repression, suppression of dissent, agricultural policy disputes"

Public institutions have a duty to ensure that people can access open, secure, and free internet when they need it the most — including during important national events. During the 2024 general election, we urge authorities in Pakistan to #KeepItOn.

We, the undersigned organisations and members of the #KeepItOn coalition — a global network of over 300 organisations from 105 countries working to end internet shutdowns — appeal to you, Prime Minister Mr. Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar and Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja, to publicly commit to ensuring that the people of Pakistan have unfettered access to the internet, social media platforms, and all other communication channels throughout the upcoming general election on February 8, 2024.

As the people of Pakistan prepare to vote, authorities in Pakistan must adopt and prioritise measures that advance human rights, by enabling unrestricted access to information and avenues for freedom of expression, assembly, and association — both offline and online. This will also contribute to an inclusive, free, and fair election process.

The internet and social media platforms play a critical role in enhancing participatory governance, advancing inclusiveness and transparency, and enabling the enjoyment of fundamental human rights in a democratic society. These platforms enable public discourse about election processes and political candidates, and allow voters to hold governments accountable for their actions. Access to the internet and digital platforms also facilitates effective election reporting, monitoring, and coverage by journalists, human rights defenders, and election observers.

History of shutdowns in Pakistan

General elections were last held in Pakistan in 2018, a year during which people in Pakistan suffered at least 11 internet shutdowns, with three separate instances in the span of just one week.

Authorities in Pakistan have a history of imposing internet shutdowns, and there have already been multiple shutdowns around opposition activities in this election cycle. In May 2023, authorities shut down the internet targeting mobile and social media platforms amidst protests following the arrest of opposition leader and former prime minister Imran Khan.

Social media access was blocked in December 2023, and on two separate occasions in January 2024, which interfered with the online election campaign by opposition parties. Given this background, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA)’s justifications, attributing a recent blackout to ongoing system upgrades which will continue for the next “two to three months” raises alarm.

Internet shutdowns harm human rights, exacerbate crises, and stop the free flow of information

Research shows that internet shutdowns and violence go hand-in-hand. Shutting down the internet during times of conflict, protests, or public health emergencies restricts the availability of vital, timely, and potentially life-saving information, as well as limiting access to emergency services. By disrupting the flow of information, shutdowns can exacerbate existing tensions, potentially instigate or conceal violence and human rights violations perpetrated by state and non-state actors, impede the work of human rights defenders, and spur the spread of misinformation.

Shutdowns also make it extremely difficult for journalists to report from the ground, thereby denying people both in and out of Pakistan access to credible information. Shutting down the internet would also make it hard for key stakeholders including Election Commission of Pakistan, national and international election observers, political party candidates, and civil society actors to closely monitor the electoral process.

Imposing internet shutdowns also interferes with people’s livelihoods and has a negative effect on entire economies. Shutdowns can cost nations billions of dollars, with businesses, public organisations, and private institutions that rely on the digital economy losing huge sums of money when they occur.

Internet shutdowns contravene domestic and international laws

Slowing or shutting down internet connection to suppress speech and assembly violates commitments under Article 19, Article 16, Article 17, and Article 19A of Pakistan’s Constitution to freedom of speech, assembly and association, and information. It also undermines the state’s responsibility towards ensuring freedom of trade, business, and profession and the right to education.

Further, as per the Sindh High Court’s recent directive, the PTA and the caretaker government must ensure smooth and uninterrupted access to mobile internet and broadband services till election day and that pre-poll rigging attempts on election day are reported through social media.

On the global scale, Pakistan is bound by international frameworks like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which provide for the protection and promotion of the rights of freedom of opinion and expression, assembly, and access to information.

Internet shutdowns are strongly condemned in international convenings including the UN Human Rights Council Resolution 47/16, which denounces ‘the use of Internet shutdowns to intentionally and arbitrarily prevent or disrupt access to or dissemination of information’. The UN Secretary General and other experts have also affirmed that, “blanket Internet shutdowns and generic blocking and filtering of services are considered by United Nations human rights mechanisms to be in violation of international human rights law.”

Telecom companies must respect human rights

Under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, telecommunications companies have a responsibility to respect human rights, prevent or mitigate potential harms, and provide remedy for any harms they cause or contribute to. Telecommunications and internet service providers operating in Pakistan have a responsibility to provide quality, open, and secure access to the internet and digital communication tools.

Internet shutdowns — whether in Pakistan or elsewhere — jeopardise human rights and must never become a norm. We encourage businesses in Pakistan to integrate the UN Principles and OECD Guidelines when responding to censorship and network disruption requests in any market where they operate.

Recommendations

As organisations championing the internet and digital platforms as enablers of human rights, we call on you to:

Publicly assure the people of Pakistan that the internet, including social media and other digital communication platforms, will remain open, accessible, inclusive, and secure before, during and after the election;

Refrain from ordering the disruption of telecommunications services, social media platforms, or other digital communication platforms throughout the elections;

Ensure that telecommunications and internet service providers (ISPs) implement all necessary measures to provide high-quality, secure, unrestricted, and uninterrupted internet access throughout the election period and thereafter; and

Ensure that telecommunication and ISPs inform the people of Pakistan of any potential disruptions, and take all reasonable steps to remedy any identified disruptions likely to impact their quality of service.

Please let us know how the #KeepItOn coalition can support you in upholding a free, open, secure, inclusive, and accessible internet for all in Pakistan.

RE: urgent call to restore and continue EU and member states’ funding to UNRWA

Dear President von der Leyen, High Representative Borrell, Commissioners Lenarčič and Várhelyi,

Dear Foreign Ministers and Development Ministers of EU member states,

We are writing in the context of the catastrophic humanitarian crisis in Gaza to urge your government and the EU collectively to announce a clear intention to continuing support for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).

As you know, UNRWA was created by the UN General Assembly in 1949 to serve Palestinian refugees who fled or were expelled from the territory that became part of the state of Israel. It has about 30,000 employees and provides direct humanitarian assistance and human development and protection programming for more than 5.9 million Palestinian refugees registered with the agency and living in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as well as Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan.

Since the beginning of the current round of hostilities in Gaza, UNRWA and other humanitarian organizations and agencies have been operating under enormous duress. UNRWA is currently sheltering over 1 million displaced Palestinians in or near 150 facilities within Gaza, including its schools. At least 376 displaced people sheltered within the agency’s premises have been killed and 1,365 have been injured between October 7 and January 31, according to UNRWA. In this same period, UNRWA also reports that 152 of its employees have been killed since October 7 and 147 of its facilities damaged in 278 “incidents” related to the conduct of hostilities.

After Israeli authorities provided UNRWA with information about the alleged involvement of its employees in the October 7 attacks, UNRWA announced that it had “immediately terminated” the contracts of the employees identified and opened an investigation to “establish the truth without delay.” The UN Secretary-General later confirmed the independence of the UN inquiry into the allegations, noting that the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) was immediately activated.

Despite that, the governments of Austria, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Romania and Sweden, among others, announced that they are indefinitely pausing or considering pausing payments to UNRWA in response to the allegations that a dozen agency staff members were involved in the October 7 attacks. By contrast, the governments of Belgium, Ireland, Luxembourg, Portugal, Slovenia, and Spain, rightly issued statements confirming their continued financial support to UNRWA, or even boosted it, while also underlining the importance of an investigation into the allegations. The EU High Representative also made a strong case to continue supporting the Agency and stressed that the suspended funds put UNRWA’s very existence at risk.

The accusations against UNRWA staff are serious and the UN appears to be taking them seriously. Should anyone be found to be responsible for criminal activities, they should be held accountable.

Withholding funds from the agency, though, could have dangerous consequences, both immediately and longer term.

Amid a desperate humanitarian situation, with people on the brink of famine, it is unconscionable to consider shutting down the UN agency most able to provide lifesaving food, water, and medicine to the more than 2.3 million people of Gaza. Aid groups have highlighted the vital need for and value of UNRWA’s operations in Gaza. In a joint statement, 21 humanitarian organizations said they were “shocked by the reckless decision to cut a lifeline for an entire population by some of the very countries that had called for aid in Gaza to be stepped up and for humanitarians to be protected while doing their job.” The director-general of the World Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders also echoed calls to donors not to suspend their UNRWA funding.

According to the Principals of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, the longest-standing and highest-level humanitarian coordination forum of the UN system, “no other entity has the capacity to deliver the scale and breadth of assistance that 2.2 million people in Gaza urgently need.” Janti Soeripto, president and CEO of Save the Children, called it “magical thinking"" for governments to think other aid groups can replace UNRWA in Gaza. The head of the Norwegian Refugee Council has said that other humanitarian groups combined “are not even close to being what UNRWA is for the people of Gaza.”

The announced halting of funding to UNRWA by some donor governments comes directly after a landmark ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in a case brought by South Africa against Israel for alleged violation of the UN Genocide Convention. Among the binding provisional measures ordered by the Court to prevent a genocide is that “[t]he State of Israel shall take immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance to address the adverse conditions of life faced by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip”.

We are also concerned about the longer-term implications shutting down UNRWA would have, especially on the right of Palestinian refugees to return, enshrined in UN General Assembly Resolution 194 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 70 percent of Gaza’s population are refugees. UNRWA plays a unique role in keeping registers and issuing of documents for Palestinian refugees who fled or were expelled from what is now Israel, and their descendants. The Israeli government refusing to fulfil that right for 75 years lies squarely among the often-referenced “root causes” of the ongoing violence.

The Israeli government has referenced the recent allegations in order to further a longstanding campaign against UNRWA. In the wake of the most recent allegations being made public, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz highlighted on January 27 his government’s longstanding opposition to UNRWA, claiming among other things that the UN agency “perpetuates the refugee issue”, and disclosed that “under his leadership,” the Israeli government intends to “work to garner bipartisan support in the US, the European Union, and other nations globally for this policy aimed at halting UNRWA’s activities in Gaza.” Prime Minister Netanyahu made similar statements on January 31.

Pending investigations on the allegations against some UNRWA staff, and with no prejudice to the adoption of measures made necessary by the results of the investigations, we urge all EU member states that already announced a halt of their funding to UNRWA to reverse their decision, continue funding the agency and for the EU collectively to express commitment to continue supporting the agency in fulfilling its vital role.

Yours sincerely,

(Berlin, February 5, 2023) – Kazakhstan authorities should guarantee that they are not targeting a well-known women’s rights advocate with criminal charges in retaliation for her work, Human Rights Watch said today. The due process rights of the advocate, Dinara Smailova, should be upheld in full in any investigation and the authorities should ensure that the criminal justice system is not being manipulated and weaponized to silence an outspoken activist and critic.

Smailova faces up to 10 years in prison on various criminal charges, including large-scale fraud. The pretrial investigation is ongoing.

“The authorities appear to be on a fishing expedition for evidence of wrongdoing by Smailova, raising serious concerns about the motivations in this case,” said Vika Kim, assistant Central Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The authorities’ spirited efforts against Smailova look more like an attempt to discredit her organization’s legitimate work, than a move to root out criminal activity.”

Smailova, 55, is founder of the NeMolchiKz Foundation, a nonprofit group that provides assistance to and advocates on behalf of survivors of sexual and domestic violence across Kazakhstan. Domestic abuse remains pervasive in Kazakhstan, compounded by scant accountability for those responsible for sexual and domestic violence, including inadequate penalties. The foundation’s activities are primarily supported by voluntary donations from individuals.

An Internal Ministry public statement issued on December 27, 2023, says that the authorities in Almaty city, and East Kazakhstan and Almaty regions are pursuing criminal charges against Smailova of large-scale fraud, violations of privacy, and knowingly disseminating false information. If convicted, in addition to a prison sentence, she faces possible confiscation of her property and a lifelong ban on holding certain positions or engaging in certain activities.

Police have gone to significant lengths to investigate possible wrongdoing by Smailova. According to Smailova’s lawyers, between October and December, the police identified more than 7,000 people who had made voluntarily contributions to the NeMolchiKz Foundation between June 18 and August 14 and questioned at least 800 of them.

The authorities claim Smailova misappropriated millions of tenge in donations for her own purposes, but according to the criminal file documents provided to the defense team, the case is currently based on complaints by six out of seven donors, whom the prosecution claims have lost a total of 23,000 tenge (about US$50). The six complaints were filed only after the criminal case was registered, alleging embezzlement to a total of 16,000 tenge (about US$35). So far, the prosecution’s case lacks credible evidence of any alleged wrongdoing by Smailova, her lawyers told Human Rights Watch.

Smailova’s lawyers have also reported publicly on multiple procedural violations by the authorities during the investigation, including initially denying one of them access to case materials.

Smailova has lived outside of Kazakhstan since 2021. East Kazakhstan police put Smailova on a regional “wanted” list, claiming her whereabouts could not be determined. Smailova first heard about the criminal investigation in late October, after multiple donors reached out to her to say they had been questioned.

Smailova contacted the East Kazakhstan region investigation department for further details, but the officials declined to provide her with detailed information about the case, Smailova said.

After learning about the criminal investigation, Smailova sought political asylum in a European country. Her asylum application is under review.

In November, prosecutors ordered her foundation’s and the foundation’s director’s bank accounts frozen.

Smailova is widely known for criticizing the authorities’ failure to adequately protect women and children from sexual and domestic violence. NeMolchiKz Foundation has provided thousands of online consultations to women experiencing family abuse. Her organization’s work has also led to the conviction of dozens of men on criminal charges of sexual violence. Nearly a dozen police officers have also been held accountable for neglect and inaction, and more than 200 law enforcement officers faced disciplinary sanctions as a result of the foundation’s work.

The investigation into Smailova follows other targeted action against women’s rights activism in Kazakhstan, Human Rights Watch said.

For years, the authorities have denied women’s rights activists and feminists the right to peaceful assembly, refusing permission to hold peaceful International Women’s Day events on March 8 to protest gender-based violence. Almaty city authorities have already denied permission for a March 8 women’s rights march and rally in 2024.

In 2020, an Almaty court penalized women’s rights activists with administrative fines for peaceful acts of free expression during an International Women’s Day march.

The Kazakhstan government has also failed to take adequate measures to protect women and girls from violence, Human Rights Watch said. The law does not criminalize domestic violence as a stand-alone offense.

“The police often take no action against those accused of sexual and domestic violence, yet they have spared little expense chasing after the head of an organization dedicated to exposing that abuse and holding the abusers accountable,” Kim said. “The authorities should respect international human rights law, upholding their legal obligations to the full, and ensure that Smailova’s due process rights are safeguarded, and that she is not being targeted in retaliation for her women’s rights work.”",HIGH,20240205T003000Z,Kazakhstan authorities,"Dinara Smailova, Vika Kim (Human Rights Watch)",Dinara Smailova,"Almaty, East Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan","Uphold due process rights, halt targeted actions against activists, address systemic violence against women",Large-scale fraud and other charges,Kazakhstan,"Targeting women’s rights activism, systemic issues in addressing domestic violence"

(Athens, February 6, 2024) – The European Commission should take immediate action to address the deterioration of media freedom and the rule of law in Greece and its impact on fundamental rights, 17 human rights and press freedom organizations said today in a letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

Threats to the rule of law include an ongoing major surveillance scandal allegedly implicating the government in the targeted hacking of journalists’ devices, government interference with the media, abusive lawsuits against journalists and activists, and an overall unsafe working environment for journalists. Two unresolved murders of journalists in 10 years underscore the risks they face. In addition, under the New Democracy government, the authorities have used the criminal justice system to threaten civil society groups and activists. Registration requirements for nongovernmental groups working on migration and asylum have imposed an unreasonable burden on them.

The Commission should take immediate action to address these concerns, including opening an independent investigation into the Greek authorities’ use of spyware to target journalists, activists, and opposition politicians. Greek authorities have taken steps to reduce transparency and scrutiny as well as to limit surveillance victims’ access to a remedy, exacerbating the fact that to date the remedies have been ineffective, the groups said.

Nongovernmental groups have repeatedly raised the alarm about attacks on the rule of law in Greece over the years, including in recent stakeholder submissions for the 2024 European Commission’s Rule of Law Report. For the second year in a row, Greece came last among European Union countries in Reporters Without Borders’ (RSF) 2023 World Press Freedom Index.

In the letter, the groups highlight the ongoing major spyware scandal and its aftermath. State surveillance of journalists raises urgent privacy and freedom of expression concerns and affects the ability of the media to hold the authorities to account. It interferes with media freedom and violates the confidentiality of journalistic sources, protected under the European Convention on Human Rights and EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Such surveillance has a chilling effect on journalism and its role in a democratic society.

Despite these warnings, the European Commission has failed to take meaningful steps to hold the Greek government to account for the breach of its rule of law and fundamental rights obligations under EU law. The Commission, including in its 2023 Rule of Law report, has expressed concerns about the situation for journalists and civil society, but neither the report nor the Commission’s related statements on Greece reflect the severity of the situation, the groups said.

The Commission should take urgent action to address the rule of law crisis in Greece and ensure that Greek authorities comply with the country’s obligations under EU law, the groups said. The Commission should investigate the concerns raised by civil society and the UN expert thoroughly and publicly and provide clear and measurable recommendations to the Greek authorities. Finally, it should also assess whether Greece's breaches of the rule of law and fundamental rights warrant the suspension of EU funds.",HIGH,20240206T083000Z,17 human rights and press freedom organizations,European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen,Greek government,Greece,"Investigate concerns thoroughly, provide clear recommendations, assess EU fund suspension",Deterioration of media freedom and rule of law,Greece,"Government interference with media, abusive lawsuits, surveillance scandal"

The UN Security Council Panel of Experts of Sudan report on Darfur, which is not yet published but already widely shared, makes for a sobering read. The report lays out in detail the waves of devastating attacks by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and their allied militias in Sudan’s West Darfur capital of El Geneina. The report also names key individuals with the RSF and militias who oversaw these abuses.

The council has a responsibility to act on these findings.

Human Rights Watch’s reporting has shown all too clearly the gravity of events unfolding in El Geneina and West Darfur over recent years, and particularly the spiraling atrocities since conflict broke out in April 2023. We documented how the RSF and allied militias carried out widespread ethnically targeted killings , sexual violence, and torture against predominantly ethnic-Massalit civilians. The forces have plundered and destroyed entire towns and civilian neighborhoods in the state, sending over half a million people fleeing into neighboring Chad.

In July, the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor both warned the Council that a “human catastrophe” was unfolding in Darfur and decided to include these events into his office’s ongoing Darfur investigations.

So far, outside of powerfully condemning the abuses, the Council has neither explicitly condemned violations of its own arms embargo, nor taken action to rein in abusive actors.

Reports show that the RSF West Darfur commander, Abdel Rahman Joma’a, explicitly named in the panel report, was present in El Geneina during the critical period of abuses between April and June. He was also in Ardamata when his forces rampaged the internally displacement camp there, killing and unlawfully detaining civilians. There are reports that he is now participating in operations in Kordofan.

The panel also recorded credible allegations against the United Arab Emirates for shipping arms and ammunition to the RSF in Darfur via Chad, in violation of the arms embargo.

The council should finally fulfil its mandate to prevent further atrocities in Darfur and act on threats to international and regional security. It can start by adding the names of those responsible for these heinous crimes to the council’s sanctions list as part of a broader strategy to end widespread abuses. Other countries and governmental bodies should use the evidence offered by the report and take immediate action under their own sanction regimes. This will send a clear message that there are serious consequences for such serious crimes.",VERY HIGH,20240206T171500Z,Human Rights Watch,Abdel Rahman Joma’a,Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and allied militias,"El Geneina, West Darfur",UN Security Council to add names of responsible individuals to sanctions list and for other countries to take action.,"Ethnically targeted killings, sexual violence, and torture against ethnic-Massalit civilians",Sudan,Ethnic tensions and ongoing conflict

(London) – The Human Rights Watch Film Festival, now in its 28th year in London, presents a lineup of 10 award-winning, international feature-length films, in partnership with Barbican Cinema and Rich Mix and generously supported by players of People’s Postcode Lottery.

The festival program, presented at the Barbican and Rich Mix from March 14 - 22, 2024, includes in-depth Q&As, and panel discussions with filmmakers, film participants, activists, and Human Rights Watch researchers following all screenings. The majority of the program will also stream across the UK and Ireland on the festival website from March 18 - 24. Tickets go on sale to the public on February 8. The festival has several ticketing options for audience members for whom cost is a barrier.

This year’s edition celebrates the convergence of art and human rights and highlights the role of youth in rising up to confront systems of power.

John Biaggi, director of the Human Rights Watch Film Festival, said:

We are very happy to present this year’s program of 10 vital and inspiring films and post-screening conversations at two of London’s standout cinemas, our long-standing venue partner, the Barbican and for the first-time, Rich Mix, a venue we’ve long admired for its ambitious and community-based programing. This year, our program of seven documentaries and three dramas spotlights the energy and determination of young people opposing systems of power, as well as art and human rights — told through the lens of women and girls, queer and trans youth, Indigenous environmental activists, and exiled artists. We also value the importance of making our program accessible.”

Laura Chow, head of charities at People’s Postcode Lottery, said:

The Human Rights Watch Film Festival inspires us to celebrate the courage of individuals who defend freedom and rights. I’m delighted funding raised by our players continues to support the Film Festival’s work giving marginalized people a platform to tell their stories, raising awareness on key human rights issues, and encouraging justice and equality. The festival will present a relaxed screening at the Barbican, and that five of the films will be audio described and play with captions, with live-transcription for the conversations to follow. Opening and closing night events will take place at the Barbican, both attended in person by the filmmakers and expert speakers.

The opening night film, Mediha, made by a documentary filmmaker, Hasan Oswald, is a heartfelt and intimate account of Mediha Alhamad, a teenage Yazidi girl recently returned from the captivity of the extremist armed group Islamic State (also known as ISIS), who turns the camera on herself as she initiates investigations into the crimes committed against her, standing up for her family and the Yazidi people in the process.

The closing night film, Summer Qamp, made by Jen Markowitz is an uplifting, funny and moving look at Camp fYrefly in the forests of Alberta, Canada, where LGBTQ+ teens explore their authentic selves, make friends, and build community—far away from the fierce political battle being waged against them.

The energy and power of young people continues in two more festival titles: Coconut Head Generation, directed by Alain Kassanda, provides front-row seats for lively, political, and impassioned debates in a student film club in Nigeria as they unpack critical issues facing young people today – from colonialism to government corruption, gender, and equality. In one of three festival dramas this year, Power Alley directed by Lillah Halla, depicts a young and vibrant LGBTQ+-inclusive volleyball team in Brazil that supports and fight for dignity and rights, especially when one of the team members must seek an abortion in a country where it is criminalized in most circumstances.

Speaking truth to power is at the heart of four films in the festival including two stand-out dramas.

The debut film by a former journalist turned feature filmmaker ,Mehdi Fikri, After the Fire, is a devastating look at a family’s fight for truth and justice after their son is killed at the hands of the police, which pulls back the curtain on France’s history of racial profiling and police violence. The sharp-witted and beautifully acted Inshallah a Boy, directed by Amjad Al Rasheed, features Nawal, a quietly powerful Jordanian mother whose husband unexpectedly passes away, leaving her to battle against a patriarchal legal system and attempts by her brother-in-law to claim all of her assets and guardianship of her daughter.

In the documentary Land of My Dreams, the filmmaker, Nausheen Khan, draws on her identity as an Indian Muslim woman. She intimately captures intergenerational, multi-faith women at the forefront of a nationwide nonviolent resistance movement, which began at Shaheen Bagh, a Muslim neighborhood in Delhi, to protest the Indian government’s Citizenship Amendment Act, which overtly discriminates against Muslims. We Are Guardians, co-directed by Edivan Guajajara, Chelsea Greene, and Rob Grobman centers the essential and dangerous work of Indigenous forest guardians battling governmental indifference, politically connected agribusinesses, cattle ranchers, and illegal loggers as they fight to protect their traditional land in the increasingly vulnerable Amazon rainforest.

The intersection between art and human rights is strikingly demonstrated in two films in the festival.

A Revolution on Canvas is a profile of one of Iran’s most revolutionary artists, Nickzad (Nicky) Nodjoumi. Filmmakers Sara Nodjoumi, his daughter, and Till Schauder create a rich tapestry of family history, artistic freedom, politics, and persecution that boldly reveals the power of art in the fight for human rights Tree of Violence, directed by Anna Moiseenko and using stunning animation that brings to life the work of the Russian graphic artist and activist Victoria (Vika) Lomasko, follows her as she investigates the connection between domestic and state-sponsored violence and patriarchy through her art, while the invasion of Ukraine unfolds and her personal safety in her homeland becomes less assured.

As always, the festival strives to prioritize space for identities, viewpoints, forms of expertise and experiences either silenced or marginalized in the film industry, news, and media. The festival is also committed to expanding opportunities for audience members to enjoy the events together and is working to create features that more people can access, including people who are blind or have low vision, and those who are deaf or hard of hearing. Five of the festival films this year will be audio described and play with captions, with live-transcription for the conversations to follow.

The military campaign that Israel launched in response to Hamas’s brutal October 7 attacks has killed more than 27,000 people in the Gaza Strip and injured more than 60,000 others, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. About 75 percent of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million has been displaced. Some 400,000 people are enduring famine because of the blockade Israel has imposed on Gaza and the severe restrictions on humanitarian aid that have deprived civilians of what they need to survive. This number could grow if international funding for aid falters.

These figures are staggering, and it is impossible to contemplate them without considering whether Israel has violated international humanitarian law during its campaign. And in fact, a good deal of publicly available information suggests that Israel has done so. Human rights organizations and news outlets have reported on the unlawful collective punishment of the Palestinian population, the use of starvation as a weapon of war, and air and artillery strikes and building demolitions that involved no discernable military targets but yielded significant civilian casualties and destroyed property. Investigations by Human Rights Watch found repeated unlawful strikes on hospitals in Gaza including the Indonesian Hospital, al-Ahli Arab Hospital, the International Eye Care Center, the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, and al-Quds Hospital in Gaza. Amnesty International found that homes full of civilians in Gaza were hit with U.S.-made Joint Direct Attack Munitions, killing 43 civilians, including 19 children.

Israel’s repeated use of heavy weapons in populated areas has heightened concerns that it might be carrying out unlawfully indiscriminate attacks. When it comes to the question of whether Israel is violating the law in Gaza, there is enough smoke to suspect a fire. This has put U.S. officials in a bind. The United States is Israel’s most important ally and greatest source of military aid and hardware. Since its founding, in 1948, it has cumulatively received more U.S. foreign aid than any other single country during that period: $300 billion, adjusted for inflation, with another $10 billion potentially on the way. But U.S. law requires the State Department to ensure that U.S. security assistance does not go to security forces that consistently commit gross violations of human rights. And current U.S. policy also requires the department to assess whether a recipient of U.S. military aid is “more likely than not” to use American weapons to violate international law—and to prohibit transfers to any country that meets that criteria.

So far, however, it is unclear whether the State Department has made these assessments. Senior U.S. officials have publicly and privately pushed the Israeli government to minimize civilian harm and allow for the delivery of more humanitarian aid to Gaza. As early as last November, Secretary of State Antony Blinken declared that “far too many Palestinians have been killed” by Israeli forces and said it was “imperative” that Israel have a “clear plan in place that puts a premium on protecting civilians.” (At the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos last month, he echoed that remark: the civilian death toll, he said, was “far too high.”) Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin delivered a similar message to Israeli authorities early in the war and sent U.S. advisers to Israel to advise the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on restraint in a challenging environment.

And yet aside from President Joe Biden’s seemingly off-the-cuff warning last December about the reputational risk Israel ran by carrying out “indiscriminate bombing,” U.S. officials have avoided clearly stating that any particular Israeli actions in Gaza were unacceptable. (Administration spokespeople spent days walking back Biden’s comment.) When journalists have asked U.S. officials direct questions about Israel’s conduct in Gaza, they have equivocated. “We’re not going to adjudicate each and every tactical event,” said John Kirby, a White House spokesperson, in December, when asked by a reporter to describe how the United States would look for evidence of Israeli violations. “I’m not going to speak about Israel’s operations,” replied Patrick Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, when a reporter asked him at a press conference in early November whether Israel’s response had been proportionate. “The U.S. military [is] not participating in IDF target development [or] helping them run their campaign,” he said in a separate exchange during the same press conference. “You know, just to be crystal clear, that it is their operation, they’re running their operation.”

Notably lacking from these official statements and many others like them was any affirmative declaration that Israel was in fact abiding by international law. If U.S. officials believed that Israel was doing so—or at least taking every possible measure to avoid harming civilians under difficult circumstances—they would eagerly say as much. They have not, even though the Biden administration hasn’t been shy about criticizing the conduct of other warring parties in other conflicts.

The reason is that drawing more attention to what is happening in Gaza would almost surely force a policy change that Biden does not want to make. It would confront his administration with a series of difficult choices that it would rather avoid. And it would further complicate the already complex dynamics of the U.S.-Israeli relationship—and possibly create a political vulnerability for Biden in an election year.

But as long as the administration sidesteps the reality of Israeli abuses in Gaza and applies the rules of military assistance selectively, the moral authority claimed by the United States will slip further away. Throughout its history, the United States has promoted respect for the laws of war: doing so, American leaders have long maintained, is one of the things that distinguishes the country from its adversaries. The Biden administration has decried the atrocities committed by the governments of countries such as Russia and Syria but has then pretended that it does not adjudicate—and bankroll—those committed by the government of Israel. The short-term gains of such an approach are far outweighed by the long-term damage it is doing to American credibility and interests. U.S. officials should say out loud what they and every impartial observer know about Israel’s conduct in Gaza: it is unacceptable, and if it does not change, U.S. policy toward military assistance to Israel will. The price of such honesty will be high. But the price of hypocrisy is even higher.

LAY DOWN THE LAW

Not all wartime deaths or injuries to civilians are violations of the laws of war. So long as armed forces attack a legitimate military objective, the weapon used or the method of attack can discriminate between combatants and civilians, and the expected civilian loss from the attack is not excessive compared with the anticipated military gain, an attack is likely lawful. Sometimes it is relatively easy to show that an attack harming civilians was a violation of the law—such as when there is no evident military target. In other circumstances, particularly if an attack may have caused disproportionate civilian harm, it can be very difficult to assess the legality of a particular attack. That is why it is crucial to collect as much information as possible in such circumstances—not only about the civilian losses but about whether enemy forces were involved.

The IDF is operating in one of the most densely populated areas on earth, and Hamas and other Palestinian fighters can disappear into the population and underground. This is a challenging environment in which to make complex targeting decisions. Hamas and Palestinian armed groups also have obligations under the laws of war. They must take all feasible precautions to minimize harm to civilians under their control and not use civilians as “human shields.” But violations on their part do not reduce Israel’s obligations.

U.S. law requires officials to assess what a recipient of American military aid does with the weapons provided. Such assessments would seem especially important when it comes to the war in Gaza, given the sheer scale of Israel’s bombardment and the reported levels of civilian loss of life. But it’s not at all clear that they are happening. Section 502B of the Foreign Assistance Act requires the State Department to ensure that U.S. security assistance does not abet gross violations of human rights. And the so-called Leahy Laws enacted decades ago by Congress prohibit US military aid going to specific units committing gross violations of human rights and have prevented military assistance from going to abusive security forces in Honduras, Nepal, and Nigeria.

But according to Josh Paul, who served in the State Department’s Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs for more than 11 years until resigning in protest over the war in Gaza last fall, the Leahy system is “broken” when it comes to Israel. Although bureau staffers identified “many” violations on Israel’s part, Paul asserted in an interview on PBS NewsHour last fall that they are unable to obtain “senior level sign-off” on those determinations. A working group formed at the State Department and dubbed the “Israel Leahy Vetting Forum” is looking into allegations of violations by the IDF, but as an informal staff grouping, its findings are not binding on the department.

State Department lawyers and atrocity crime experts in the department’s Office of Global Criminal Justice are often called on to assess violations of international law in conflicts. Under Blinken, that office and the department’s legal team have reviewed evidence and made official proclamations about violations of international law by the governments of China, Ethiopia, Myanmar, and Sudan. But there is no publicly available evidence that the GCJ or any other office has been asked to make determinations about Israel’s campaign in Gaza.

The harm done by the Biden administration’s apparent unwillingness to apply a legal lens to available information is compounded by its seeming failure to adhere even to policies it has itself put in place as an expression of Biden’s putative commitment to human rights. Last year, the State Department adopted what it calls the Conventional Arms Transfer (CAT) policy, which requires officials to assess whether a security partner is “more likely than not” to use U.S. weapons to violate international law. If the answer is yes, the U.S. government is prohibited from making transfers to that country.

The White House introduced the policy in February 2023, recognizing that “when not employed responsibly, defense materiel can be used to violate human rights and international humanitarian law, increase the risk of civilian harm, and otherwise damage United States interests.” But U.S. support to Israel since the hostilities in Gaza began likely means that the administration violated its own policy almost immediately after it was put in place. In meetings with representatives from nongovernmental organizations, State Department officials have said they are assessing Israel’s conduct under the CAT policy but declined to reveal any findings they have made or provide a timeline for doing so.

Last August, the Biden administration also issued new rules, dubbed the Civilian Harm Investigations and Response Guidance, to compel the State Department to investigate allegations of U.S. weapons being used to harm civilians. According to State Department officials, some of the first investigations launched under the CHIRG have looked into Israel’s conduct in Gaza. But the result of CHIRG investigations are not required to be made public, and U.S. officials are not bound to act on the basis of whatever the investigations reveal.

As the Biden administration buries its head in the sand, Congress seems similarly reluctant to seriously examine the situation. In December, Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, put forward a resolution in the Senate that would have required the State Department to report on Israel’s adherence to international law: a reasonable, straightforward request to ensure Israel is abiding by Congress’s own legislation on arms transfers. The resolution would not have cut off aid to Israel, but it nevertheless failed, as too many senators either believe there is no reason to question Israel’s conduct—or don’t want to look too closely at the facts.

The reason behind this Congressional timidity—and the reason why the Biden administration seems not to have used any of the tools at its disposal to assess Israeli conduct—is hardly a mystery: publicly acknowledging any Israeli violation of international or U.S. law would mean having to answer uncomfortable follow-up questions and make difficult decisions about how to change or condition future military aid to Israel. (There is also the question of whether individual officials might face legal jeopardy for complicity in grave abuses if Israeli misconduct were officially acknowledged: in recent years, U.S. officials cut back on military support to Saudi Arabia’s indiscriminate strikes in Yemen, which killed thousands of civilians—apparently at least in part out of fear that continuing to do so might make them legally complicit in war crimes.)

A DANGEROUS DOUBLE STANDARD

The worst result of the administration’s refusal to comply with the letter and spirit of U.S. law is that Washington might be making possible the massive and potentially criminal loss of civilian life in Gaza. But another victim of this approach is U.S. credibility, which has been damaged by what is at best inconsistency and at worst hypocrisy. Consider, for example, how in 2016, President Barack Obama condemned Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s denial of food and water to civilians in Aleppo. Israel has arguably done the same thing to Gaza’s civilian population for over three months without any criticism for this tactic from the Biden administration. (Biden has pushed Netanyahu to open access to Gaza for more aid but has not directly criticized the blockade.)

Russia’s indiscriminate airstrikes on hospitals and schools in Ukraine have rightly drawn condemnation from Biden and other administration officials. But Israel has also carried out attacks striking hospitals and schools without eliciting much protest from the White House. “We do not want to see innocent patients who are sick or wounded be injured or killed in the crossfire,” National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on CNN in November. But, Sullivan added, the IDF had assured Washington “that they are looking for ways to be able to ensure the safety and security of individual patients in those hospitals.” The situations that the Russian and Syrian governments faced were not comparable to Israel’s after the Hamas-led attacks on October 7. But once a country decides to use military force, it must fully adhere to the laws that govern conduct in war, which apply to all countries, as well as nonstate armed groups.

Some might argue that the United States can afford a little hypocrisy in order to support its longtime ally Israel. But playing a part in the erosion of international law will have harmful consequences for the United States far beyond Gaza. Future declarations by the State Department concerning atrocities will ring hollow, making it harder to hold perpetrators accountable and deter future international crimes. Pressure on warring parties to abide by the laws of war in other places—for example, Azerbaijan or Sudan—will carry less weight. In the eyes of the world, it will become harder to distinguish the United States from countries that outright dismiss international law and intentionally undermine the rules-based international order through their actions.

To start reining in Israel and to stop the hemorrhaging of American credibility, the Biden administration needs to task its lawyers to assess all available information—classified and unclassified—on Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and determine when and where Israeli forces have violated the laws of war, and whether the IDF held those responsible to account. Their findings should be made public, and the evidence presented to Congress. While those assessments are happening, Israel should be put on notice that U.S. military aid is at risk.

The political costs of looking squarely at the evidence and correcting U.S. policy as necessary won’t be comfortable for a president and legislators on the campaign trail. But those costs are lower than the cost of U.S. authorities acting as if the acute suffering of the Palestinian people in Gaza does not deserve the same scrutiny as the suffering of civilians in other conflicts, a stance that gives ammunition to those who claim that, when it comes to applying core American principles and protecting basic human rights, Washington applies an obvious—and obviously hypocritical—double standard.",VERY HIGH,20240208T220000Z,Human rights organizations and news outlets,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, President Joe Biden",Israeli government,Gaza Strip,"Full assessment of Israeli military actions, transparency in U.S. military aid conditions, and public accountability for violations","Unlawful collective punishment, use of starvation as a weapon of war, indiscriminate attacks causing civilian casualties",Israel,"Military actions by Israel in response to Hamas attacks, political complexities in U.S.-Israeli relations"

(Beirut) – An Egyptian court on February 6, 2024, sentenced the prominent politician Ahmed Tantawy, along with his campaign advisor and 21 of his detained supporters, to a year in prison for alleged offenses associated with his presidential challenge to President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Human Rights Watch said today. The court also barred Tantawy from running for national elections for five years. Tantawy and his aide, Mohamed Abu al-Dyar, were released on bail pending appeal.

The ruling by a Cairo court for minor offenses was entirely based on Tantawy’s peaceful political activism and the efforts of Tantawy’s campaign to collect support statements before the December 2023 presidential vote, in which Sisi won a third six-year term with 89.6 percent of the vote. Human Rights Watch documented the months-long series of unlawful arrests, intimidation, and prosecutions against potential candidates and their supporters which preceded the election, all of which effectively prevented any meaningful competition.

“The Egyptian authorities should immediately throw out the abusive charges against Tantawy and his supporters, which are nothing more than retaliation for his peaceful campaign to challenge President Sisi,” said Amr Magdi, senior Middle East and North Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch. “It isn't just that the authorities are punishing peaceful dissent. By barring Tantawy from running in future elections, the authorities are sending a clear message that no serious challenge to Sisi will be tolerated.”

Tantawy and his supporters can appeal their sentences under Supreme State Security Case No. 2255 of 2023. The court ordered him and Abu al-Dyar to pay 20,000 Egyptian pounds each (about US$648) to avoid detention pending their appeal. Tantawy was the most prominent challenger to Sisi. Tantawy terminated his campaign on October 13, 2023, after repressive tactics by the authorities, including retaliatory detentions of his family members and supporters, prevented his campaign from collecting the 25,000 voters’ endorsements required to officially file his candidacy.

Tantawy’s campaign was able to galvanize plausible traction in Egypt’s otherwise strictly curtailed political sphere. When his campaign began collecting unofficial support statements to showcase the size of his support, the authorities arrested his supporters, claiming that this violated election laws because they printed out support statements without authorization.

Law No. 45 of 2014 on the Regulation of the Exercise of Political Rights provides for a minimum of one year in prison and/or a fine of 1,000 to 5,000 pounds (about $32 to $162) for “printing or distributing, in any way, election ballots or documents used in the electoral process” without authorization. Using this article to restrict the ability of activists to collect support statements or endorsements in the context of a political campaign is incompatible with the rights to freedom of expression and association under international human rights law, Human Rights Watch said.

Tantawy’s campaign shared with Human Rights Watch a list of dozens of supporters whom it said authorities have detained in recent months in nine Supreme State Security cases. The Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights said that at least 127 people have been detained on charges similar to those in Tantawy’s case and in relation to his campaign.

The Supreme State Security Prosecution (SSSP) is a branch of the public prosecution that has served in recent years as one of the government’s primary tools of repression, often keeping tens of thousands of dissidents in custody in prolonged and abusive pretrial detention, without a chance to be released on bail and based solely on peaceful activism. The SSSP routinely fails to investigate cases of torture and abuses in detention while using torture-tainted confessions against political dissidents and critics.

All those arrested without credible evidence of a recognizable offense should be immediately and unconditionally released, Human Rights Watch said.

“By continuing the persecution of Tantawy for challenging Sisi, Egyptian authorities have further pulled the mask off a farcical electoral process that ensures one-man rule and annihilates Egyptians’ right to genuine political participation,” Magdi said.",HIGH,20240208T073000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Ahmed Tantawy, Mohamed Abu al-Dyar",Egyptian authorities,"Cairo, Egypt","Immediate release of all political detainees, cessation of repressive practices against dissenters.",Unlawful arrests and persecution of political dissenters,Egypt,Repressive political environment under President Sisi's regime

MYKHAILO PURYSHEV, MARIUPOL RESIDENT AND HUMANITARIAN VOLUNTEER: “With the onset of the war, everyone’s life changed. Everything changed.”

VOICE IN VIDEO: “Stay back!”

This is the story of Russia’s assault on Mariupol.

A strategic port city in southeastern Ukraine.

These are the interviews, videos, photos, and 3D models that Human Rights Watch, SITU Research, and Truth Hounds used to reconstruct the struggles residents faced as Russian forces took over the city.

This is Mariupol after Russian forces occupied the city. Russia’s full-scale military invasion of Ukraine began on February 24, 2022, as its forces attacked Ukrainian positions defending Mariupol.

The city was pounded by explosive weapons for weeks.

Much of Mariupol was seriously damaged in the Russian assault. Human Rights Watch and SITU Research conducted a detailed damage assessment of the destruction. While satellite imagery shows damage to rooftops, our modeling reveals more. We used over 850 videos and photos of buildings that we found online and verified, in addition to satellite imagery, to capture the extent of the devastation in the city center. Buildings with damage are seen here in red. Our analysis shows that 93% of the 477 high-rise apartment buildings in this area were damaged. Some of this imagery could help prove war crimes. Our focus was Mariupol’s main avenue, Myru or “Peace” Avenue, and the immediate surrounding area, the city center, which includes cultural hubs, hospitals, schools, and universities.

And this is Mariupol before.

DMYTRO KULYK: “It’s [was] a town with about half a million inhabitants.”

HALYNA MOROKHOVSKA: “Recently, it had blossomed. We had new parks. The city center was well-developed.”

NATALIIA TKACHENKO: “In general, the city was becoming modern and vibrant.

For Russian forces, Mariupol was a strategic prize. It would give them control of one of Ukraine’s largest ports and a land corridor between occupied Crimea to the west and areas Russia had been controlling in Donbas, to the northeast.

As the attack on the city began, tens of thousands of civilians huddled in shelters and basements to escape Russian bombing and shelling. Many people we spoke to relocated to the city center, which they believed to be safe.

DENYS SHEVTSOV: “Most people moved in all directions. To a bomb shelter, to a basement. Some stayed in their apartments. But we believe it isn’t safe to stay in the apartment... We are in the basement now. This is our makeshift bomb shelter. These are the conditions we live in. About 40 people live here with us, about 15 children.”

DENYS SHEVTSOV: “This morning, our yard was heavily shelled. Basically, all the cars were destroyed, and the windows.”

Russian forces used a variety of explosive weapons in Mariupol including aerial bombs and ground-launched artillery, such as projectiles and rockets. The use of these weapons in populated areas is the greatest threat to civilians in contemporary armed conflicts and heightens the risk of unlawfully indiscriminate attacks.

HALYNA MOROKHOVSKA: “An aerial bomb hit the dormitory. My face was torn up. I had cuts everywhere. My arm, chest, stomach, legs.”

VOICE IN VIDEO: “It’s coming from that side.”

VOICE #2 IN VIDEO: Come into the entryway...

DMYTRO KULYK: “Dead bodies became an ordinary sight for me. We were told that seven people died that one day. Two children and five adults.

Under the laws of war, parties have an obligation to do everything feasible to minimize harm to civilians.

These are the maternity and pediatric units of a hospital that Russian forces bombed on March 9.

At least three people were killed, including a pregnant woman and her baby, who was stillborn after the attack. Seventeen people were injured. In this case, witnesses told us that there were no Ukrainian military personnel, vehicles, or installations close by at the time. A deliberate strike on a hospital not being used to carry out attacks harmful to the enemy, is a war crime.

Humanitarian volunteer Mykhailo Puryshev was about 400 meters from the hospital by Pryazovskysi State Technical University.

MYKHAILO PURYSHEV: “Everyone is very, very afraid. Everyone is very afraid. You hear that, don’t you? The rumbling. It’s Mariupol... “

MYKHAILO PURYSHEV: “I heard an airplane approaching… And I shouted “Airplanes!” and we all ran... “

MYKHAILO PURYSHEV: Fucking hell! Go down!

MYKHAILO PURYSHEV: “When I went outside, I saw the full horror of what had happened.”

VOICE IN VIDEO: “Was it a mine?”

MYKHAILO PURYSHEV: “No, an airstrike most likely.”

VOICE IN VIDEO: “Grandma...”

MYKHAILO PURYSHEV: “Drag her, drag her!”

At least two people were killed on the spot. Witnesses said there were no military targets at the university. An attack that is not directed at a specific military objective is a laws-of-war violation and a possible war crime. Numerous images posted on social media and given to us by witnesses helped us assess the damage to parts of the university campus. The fighting damaged vital infrastructure, knocking out the city’s electricity grid, which in turn cut essential services.

DENYS SHEVTSOV: “So, we’re left without gas, without water, without power. We are absolutely isolated from civilization. No internet, no updates. Nothing.”

DMYTRO KULYK: ‘’If you want to wash your hands, this is the only way. So we pick up snow, put it in a bucket. Then we put the bucket on an open fire and boil the water.”

DENYS SHEVTSOV: “Here is our field stove. We live like in the Stone Age in caves. This is what I call really living it up during the war. Bacon, pasta. And shells are flying overhead. As long as they don’t make barbecue out of us.”

DENYS SHEVTSOV: “The city was destroyed. And every day, the city was getting destroyed more and more.”

DMYTRO KULYK: “I am telling you, day after day, these explosions became more frequent. Every day, they got louder and more hellish.”

We used satellite imagery, photos, and videos to track damage across Mariupol. We found 86 out of 89 schools and universities were damaged, and all the city’s 19 hospital campuses. The damage to these facilities devastated health care and education across the city.

VAAGN MNATSAKANIAN: “Every day we thought about when we could leave. But we realized that the city was completely closed off and there was no way to leave.”

In the first two weeks of March, multiple attempts to provide safe passage out of the city failed in the face of Russian obstruction. Arbitrary restrictions on the evacuation of civilians or the delivery of aid would amount to a violation of the laws of war and possible war crimes.

In early March, hundreds of people had gathered at the Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theater, for shelter and in the hope of getting safe passage out of Mariupol.

Nataliia Tkachenko arrived on March 12 after an attack destroyed her home.

NATALIIA TKACHENKO: “They gave us a bit of food. A soup in the afternoon, a cup of boiled water in the morning and evening. It was something. At home there was no water, no food, nothing. It was dark, there was no electricity. It was impossible to use the toilets. There was no water. Nobody was cleaning them. It was a nightmare. No one was walking around the theater. Only kids were running around because kids will be kids. They were playing and laughing.”

At least 500 people were sheltering at the theater on March 16. Giant Cyrillic letters spelling “children” were painted on the ground in front and at the back of the theater. These words were clearly visible on satellite imagery.

Nataliia was bringing water inside, by the main entrance.

NATALIIA TKACHENKO: “And at that moment, the bomb struck. The shockwave hit us. Everything was flying around. Cement got in my mouth, eyes, everywhere. Shards of wood and glass. I couldn’t hear anything except the humming, the cracking.”

Satellite imagery, videos, and photographs of the theater show that the central part of the roof and the northern and southern walls were destroyed. At least 15 people were killed and the total number has not been determined. Given the absence of a military target at the theater, it appears that Russian forces deliberately attacked civilians, which would amount to a war crime.

Those responsible for war crimes in Mariupol should be held to account. By reviewing official Russian government statements, social media posts, and obituaries of Russian soldiers, we identified 17 military units that took part in the 2022 siege of Mariupol.

Considering the extent of the military operation, the highest levels of Russian command likely knew the situation in the city and were involved in the planning, execution, and coordination of the actions of the Russian and Russia-affiliated forces.

Those responsible for the conduct of Russian forces during the siege of Mariupol include President Vladimir Putin, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu, and Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, Valery Gerasimov, among others.

As the battle for the city raged, food and other basic supplies ran low.

VOICE IN VIDEO: Wait. Step back a little.

MIKHAILO PURYSHEV: You may crush others! Please!

MIKHAILO PURYSHEV: “The worst problem was probably not with food or heat, but with medication. And people were just dying because there was none. The people who suffered the most were older people and children.”

Thousands were killed in attacks. Others died from health complications due to lack of medicine and clean water.

MIKHAILO PURYSHEV: “Mariupol is a big, big, big, big cemetery. There were a lot of people left under the rubble. So it remains to be seen how many people died there.”

TETIANA BURAK: “We were horrified at what we saw because there were burnt multi-story houses and bodies in the streets.”

HALYNA MOROKHOVSKA: “It was impossible to count them because people were buried under the debris, on the roads.”

Many were buried in a makeshift trench grave in the Old City Cemetery.

VAAGN MNATSAKANIAN: “We filled one trench [with bodies] completely. There were about 200 bodies.”

These bodies from the trench grave and many other makeshift graves across the city were exhumed and reburied in the city's cemeteries when Russian forces took over. We estimated the minimum number of people killed by fighting or who died of poor conditions. To do so, we counted graves in two types of burial sites. In some cases, we counted individual graves visible in high resolution satellite imagery. We also estimated the number of bodies buried in trench-type graves. We verified footage at two cemeteries which allowed us to count the plaques, sticks with a small wooden panel, in a given area. We then used this sample size to extrapolate to other parts of the cemeteries. In five cemeteries in and around Mariupol between March 2022 and February 2023, we estimated at least 10,284 new burials.

We do not know how many of these people were civilians. Considering average annual death rates in Mariupol, we calculated more than 8,000 people would not have died were it not for the attack on the city. This is likely a significant underestimation of the total number of dead, as many graves contained multiple bodies and the remains of others were likely buried in the rubble and taken away during demolition efforts.

With the city still under Russian occupation and much of the physical evidence destroyed, the full death toll may never be known.

DENYS SHEVSTOV: “Look around. What is going on, what’s happening in our Mariupol. It’s completely destroyed. Completely gone, just disappeared. Just nothing. Just ruins.”

With attacks by Russian forces continuing, tens of thousands of residents found their way out of the city at great personal risk beginning in mid-March.

DENYS SHEVSTOV: “We were hoping war suddenly will stop and finally we realized this is not going to happen, we decided to run away. We hope we will be fine but overall, it’s been horrible, just horrible.”

By mid May 2022, Russian forces had full control of the city.

The bombs might have stopped now but the city’s tragedy is far from over.

The psychological effects of the fighting, displacement, and the losses that Mariupol’s residents experienced will reverberate for years to come.

DMYTRO KULYK: “Mariupol is a city that has become hell.”

TETIANA BURAK: “People should know what is happening.”

VAAGN MNATSAKANIAN: “We realized that no matter how much we want our pre-war life, our city, our friends, our loved ones, our apartments, we won’t get them back”

This footage is from October 2022. Since occupying the city, Russian forces are demolishing buildings and constructing new ones. Russia is also replacing Ukrainian culture with its own.

For justice to be done, the survivors of Mariupol need reparations for their losses. The loss of their homes, their loved ones, their livelihoods, and the impact on their mental health.

Russian officials and military commanders credibly implicated in war crimes committed in the city need to be brought to justice.

NATALIIA TKACHENKO: “When I got to Ukrainian territory, my first words were, “These people should be punished!””

During a parliamentary session on Thursday, Japan’s Justice Minister Ryuji Koizumi said that between 2014 and 2022, the Justice Ministry found six violations of a 2014 directive effectively banning all penal institutions from using restraints on imprisoned pregnant women inside delivery rooms.

Last November, Human Rights Watch published accounts of formerly imprisoned women who described such violations happening to other women in prison.

“We have been researching this matter since issuing the directive in 2014, and as a result, up until the end of 2022, we found six violations in which handcuffs were used,” Koizumi said in response to a question by an opposition lawmaker. “In light of this, we broadened the directive in 2022 to refrain from the use of handcuffs when [imprisoned people are] holding, bathing, changing diapers, and breastfeeding babies.” The Japanese government will “think of appropriate measures” going forward, the justice minister added.

Restraining imprisoned people under such circumstances contravenes international standards. Rule 48 of the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (the Mandela Rules ) states that “instruments of restraint shall never be used on women during labour, childbirth and immediately after birth.” In addition, the commentary to rule 24 of the Bangkok Rules states that using “body restraints, such as shackles ... on pregnant women during transfers to hospitals, gynecological examinations, and birth ... violates international standards.”

Some governments have already taken action to prevent the use of restraints on imprisoned pregnant people. In 2018, the US government enacted the First Step Act, which prohibits “the use of restraints on pregnant inmates” in the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. In 2021, New Zealand’s Department of Corrections said it “will no longer use handcuffs on women who are 30 weeks or more pregnant.”

The Japanese government should follow suit, ensuring restraints aren’t used on imprisoned pregnant people by further broadening the directive to prohibit using restraints on women during labor and immediately after birth. Authorities should also ensure that imprisoned people are informed about their legal right to seek permission to keep their child with them in prison, subject to approval by the prison warden, and encourage prison wardens to consider such requests expeditiously and sympathetically. At the same time, the government should encourage prosecutors to use article 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedures and suspend sentences for imprisoned people who are 150 or more days pregnant, among other grounds.",HIGH,20240209T023000Z,Human Rights Watch,Ryuji Koizumi,Japanese Government,Japan,"Prohibit use of restraints, inform imprisoned women of their rights, expedite considerations for keeping children in prison, suspend sentences for pregnant women.",Violations of the directive banning restraints on imprisoned pregnant women,Japan,Failure to adhere to established international standards

(New York) – India’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government is using abusive foreign funding laws, trumped-up financial investigations, and other means to unlawfully attack civil society groups, Human Rights Watch said today. The arbitrary use of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) against nonprofit organizations and the politically motivated targeting of peaceful critics undermine Indian government claims of being a rights-respecting democracy.

On February 2, 2024, India’s national investigation agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), raided the home and offices of Harsh Mander, a prominent human rights activist, and filed a police investigation. In January, the authorities ordered X, formerly known as Twitter, to block Hindutva Watch, a project that documents crimes against minorities in India. The authorities have also blocked access to the website of India Hate Lab, which tracks instances of hate speech.

“India’s efforts to muzzle activist groups just highlight the extent to which the government is violating basic rights,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Foreign governments concerned with India’s assault on civil society should be speaking out, not waiting for the situation to deteriorate further.”

Mander recently led a peace march in Manipur, where a communal conflict has claimed over 200 lives. The authorities raided his home after a Home Ministry official filed a complaint alleging financial irregularities under FCRA by the Centre of Equity Studies, a research organization that Mander heads. The complaint also links other nonprofit organizations to the alleged misconduct, including Aman Biradari Trust, Oxfam India, and Action Aid Association.

Over 250 scholars, activists, and civil society members condemned the raid against Mander, terming it a “vindictive witch hunt.” Mander told Human Rights Watch: “I have been determined from the start of these attacks – and they have been going on for years – that I will not let anything that the state does to me silence my conscience or my voice or crush my work.”

In June 2023, Indian authorities had temporarily suspended the FCRA license of the Centre for Equity Studies because Mander had allegedly violated the law by becoming a frequent columnist for various national newspapers and independent publications.

Since 2016, the authorities have routinely revoked or suspended licenses, and have accused nonprofit organizations of evading the law, freezing their bank accounts. Human rights groups fear this is one way for the government to gain control over organizations. As of February 6, the Home Ministry had cancelled 20,697 FCRA licenses, according to official data. Among those denied funding are numerous groups that have long promoted human rights and democracy.

On February 3, the Tamil Nadu Social Service Society, a Christian charity, lost its FCRA license for alleged violations that remain unclear. In January, the Centre for Policy Research (CPR) lost its license after the authorities claimed that the research institution diverted foreign donations to allegedly fund “protests and legal battles against developmental projects” to “affect India’s economic interests.” In a statement, CPR denied the allegations and called the move “incomprehensible and disproportionate.”

The authorities also cancelled the license of World Vision India, a Christian charity that has functioned in the country for over 60 years, primarily focusing on humanitarian support to children in poor communities. In a statement, World Vision said it was “profoundly disappointed,” and that the decision will only cause harm to “many vulnerable people across the country in the coming years.”

Hindutva Watch and India Hate Lab are no longer accessible in the country for allegedly violating the Information Technology Act 2000. Journalists and online critics are increasingly at risk of prosecution under this law and the IT Rules of 2021 for content critical of the authorities. The founder of both projects, Raqib Hameed Naik, told Human Rights Watch that the decision is “extremely alarming and points to casting a wide net of censorship against groups documenting and studying hate crimes, hate speech, and disinformation,” and that it “directly infringes upon the fundamental right of every citizen to access information.”

The BJP government, which promotes a Hindu majoritarian ideology, has failed to protect religious minorities and instead adopted policies that infringe on their rights, and has previously cracked down on documentation of such abuses. The US Commission on International Religious Freedom has recently issued several statements and reports about India’s worsening attacks on religious minorities, and a February 7 report by Amnesty International outlines extensive use of targeted demolitions of Muslim properties across India as a form of extra-judicial punishment.

Human Rights Watch has documented widespread human rights violations committed by the Nicaraguan government since a brutal crackdown against in protesters in 2018 initiated the current human rights crisis.

The government of President Daniel Ortega, in office since 2007, has dismantled all checks on executive power and systematically used repression to silence dissent and curtail fundamental freedoms.

President Ortega and his wife, Vice-President Rosario Murillo, have subordinated the judiciary by packing the courts with judges allied to their party who have arbitrarily persecuted critics and dissidents. The National Assembly, which they control, has enacted far-reaching restrictions on civil and political rights, including freedom of expression and association. The government also controls the Supreme Electoral Council (Consejo Supremo Electoral, CSE), Nicaragua’s electoral oversight body, which has barred opposition political parties.

In 2018, police, in coordination with armed pro-government groups, brutally repressed protestors. More than 300 people were killed and more than 2,000 were injured, according to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR).

We documented that many detainees were subject to serious abuses, in some cases amounting to torture—including electric shocks, severe beatings, nail removal, asphyxiation, and rape. Some were reportedly denied medical care in public health centers, and doctors who provided care said they suffered retaliation.

Nobody has been held accountable for these human rights violations.

Rather, the government has intensified repression. People perceived as government critics, including human rights defenders, journalists, lawyers, political opponents, businesspeople, students and peasant leaders and members of the Catholic church, have increasingly become the targets of harassment, arbitrary detention and prosecution, confiscation of their assets, arbitrary deprivation of their nationality, and many have even been expelled from their own country.

In the run-up to the November 2021 presidential elections, we documented that dozens of critics, including seven would-be presidential candidates, were arbitrarily detained for months, most of them accused of “treason,” and held incommunicado. Many were subjected to repeated interrogations and abusive conditions, including prolonged solitary confinement or insufficient food. The government charged many with serious crimes without providing substantiating evidence.

On February 9, 2023, the government released 222 political prisoners and expelled them to the United States, labeling them as “traitors,” stripping them of their nationality and confiscating their assets. While these releases ended years of suffering for many detainees and their families, the decision to arbitrarily strip them of their nationality is a flagrant violation of international human rights law, including the 1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. Later, the government also stripped the nationality of 95 other government critics, journalists, human rights defenders, writers, and political leaders.

As of December 2023, over 100 people perceived as government critics remained in detention, according to a Nicaraguan rights group, most charged with “undermining national integrity” and “propagating fake news.” Victims of arbitrary arrest have included an increasing number of members of the Catholic church, including 31 priests and other members of the church, who the government released in two groups in October 2023 and January 2024 and sent to the Vatican.

The government has also dramatically restricted civic space. Since 2018, authorities have canceled the legal status of over 3,500 nongovernmental organizations, including women’s rights groups, religious associations, and medical groups. This figure represents approximately 50% of the non-profit organizations that existed in Nicaragua prior to April 2018, when authorities reported a total of 6,500 organizations operating in the country.

Among the groups stripped of their legal registration are dozens of humanitarian organizations, which played a critically important role in ensuring access to health services, water, and food for low-income, mostly rural communities. Authorities have also canceled the legal status of 28 universities, including, most prominently, the Jesuit-run Universidad Centroamericana (UCA). They have seized their assets and left thousands of students without access to education. A 2020 “foreign agents” law allows the cancelation of legal status of organizations that obtain foreign funds and conduct activities that “interfere in Nicaragua’s internal affairs.”

The government has also closed at least 57 media outlets, the Nicaraguan Platform of NGO Networks reported, and at least 208 media workers have fled the country. Authorities have imposed restrictions to hinder several outlets’ operations, including by blocking access to printing materials. Police have raided and seized assets from Confidencial, 100% Noticias, and La Prensa.

Many people have been forced to leave their country due to political persecution, fear of being arbitrarily detained, and lack of economic opportunities. Between 2018 and June 2022, more than 260,000 Nicaraguans, roughly 4 % of the country’s estimated population, left the country, mostly to Costa Rica and the United States.

The Ortega government has repeatedly refused to cooperate with international human rights bodies. No international human rights monitor has been allowed to access the country since the government expelled staff members of the IACHR and OHCHR in late 2018.The government has not implemented the recommendations of the OHCHR.

Many foreign governments have vocally denounced these abuses, imposed targeted sanctions. Importantly, some, including the UK, helped create, at the United Nations Human Rights Council, a Group of Experts on Nicaragua that, in March 2023 found reasonable grounds to conclude that authorities have committed crimes against humanity, including murder, imprisonment, torture, sexual violence, forced deportation, and persecution on political grounds.

While these international efforts are important and welcomed, so far, neither targeted sanctions nor isolated condemnations have succeeded in exerting sufficient pressure on the Ortega government. Addressing the crisis in Nicaragua requires multilateral coordination and sequencing to pressure the government to restore democratic freedoms and negotiate the reforms that would allow for free and fair elections.

The UK—which has already adopted sanctions on 14 individuals implicated in serious abuses—can continue making important contributions. We respectfully urge you:

Support the initiative, launched in July 2023 by 179 Nicaraguan victims and 29 human rights organizations, to create a “Group of Friends of the Nicaraguan People”, that should conduct high-level meetings to design, in consultation with Nicaraguan civil society groups and other relevant stakeholders, a strategy to curb abuses, provide pathways to accountability, and push for free and fair elections. Promote efforts to conduct criminal investigations against senior officials in the Nicaraguan government under the principle of universal jurisdiction. This principle allows authorities to prosecute certain grave crimes, such as torture, regardless of where they occur and the nationality of victims and suspects. Urge international development banks funding Nicaragua, such as the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI), to ensure that their loans are not contributing to human rights violations by the Nicaraguan government. Continue imposing targeted sanctions, ideally in coordination with other governments. These should entail travel bans and asset freezes on senior government officials who bear responsibility for human rights violations, including President Daniel Ortega.

(Jerusalem) – Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered the Israeli army and other officials to submit to the cabinet a plan to evacuate Rafah, Gaza’s southernmost governorate. Netanyahu said this action is necessary to attack Hamas battalions in the area.

With a pre-war population of 280,000, Rafah is now housing the majority of Gaza’s population, including most of the 1.7 million displaced Palestinians. Conditions are increasingly desperate, with people sheltering in makeshift camps—tents built with flimsy materials—and in overcrowded apartment buildings. Many have been displaced multiple times amid intense Israeli airstrikes and ground operations, as well as the continued blockade.

International humanitarian law prohibits the forced displacement of civilians except when temporarily required for their security or imperative military reasons. During the hostilities in Gaza, Human Rights Watch has warned that forced displacement, a war crime, is becoming more of a risk. Any forced displacement of the population would not relieve Israeli forces of their responsibility to take all feasible measures to protect the civilian population. Civilians who do not evacuate following warnings are still fully protected by international humanitarian law. Many civilians may be unable to heed a warning to evacuate for reasons of health, disability, fear, or lack of any place else to go.

On January 26, the International Court of Justice ordered provisional measures in South Africa’s case alleging that Israel is violating the Genocide Convention, which require Israel to prevent genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, enable the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance, and prevent and punish incitement to commit genocide.

The following statement can be attributed to Nadia Hardman, refugee and migrant rights researcher at Human Rights Watch.

The sharp reduction in financial and technical development support for Afghanistan’s public health system since the Taliban takeover in August 2021 has severely harmed the country’s healthcare system. The lack of sufficient healthcare services has undermined the right to health for millions of Afghans and has left the population vulnerable to disease and other consequences of inadequate medical care. Women and girls have been disproportionately affected by the healthcare crisis, particularly because of Taliban abuses. The Taliban’s restrictions on women’s freedom of movement and employment with humanitarian and other organizations have gravely impeded women and girls’ access to health services, while bans on education for women and girls have blocked almost all training of future female healthcare workers in the country.

The collapse of the Afghan economy and the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs after the Taliban takeover drove many Afghans into extreme poverty, leaving them unable to pay medical expenses, worsening their social determinants of health, and threatening rights essential for maintaining an adequate standard of living, including the right to food. The result has been life-threatening for many Afghans, including millions of children suffering malnutrition. Almost two-thirds of the Afghan population needed humanitarian aid by the end of 2023. Cuts to international humanitarian assistance in 2023, with more anticipated, and a longstanding drought have further threatened the availability and accessibility of adequate food and exacerbated the crisis.

Over the previous two decades, the Afghan government had depended on international development support from donors to fund essential services like primary health care, even as Afghans paid the majority of healthcare costs from their own pockets. The previous government’s own contribution to the public primary care system was negligible, leaving it vulnerable to collapse once aid was withdrawn. Donor development aid for Afghanistan’s public health system was approximately six times the government’s own expenditure on health, with rising insecurity and declining donor support after 2012 already causing staffing and supply shortages. After the Taliban takeover, the World Bank and other donor countries and institutions cut all development funding, including for health, although humanitarian aid temporarily increased in 2021-2022, only to face cuts in 2023. The sharp drop in development support sent a shock through the economy and the public health system; compounding the crisis, many Afghan healthcare professionals left the country or quit their jobs.

Humanitarian aid organizations have tried to make up for the loss of donor-provided public health funds, particularly in hospital support, however they cannot replace what had been provided for the public health system. With the decrease in funding for humanitarian assistance after 2022, aid organizations have shifted their focus toward immediate relief efforts only. Temporary support to public hospitals immediately after August 2021 prevented a total collapse, but aid organizations have also closed clinics due to a lack of funds, and local aid groups that cannot import their own supplies have reported shortages of medicines and equipment. Humanitarian assistance and exemptions to sanctions prevented a worse catastrophe in the first two years after the Taliban takeover; however, shrinking humanitarian aid now imperils the entire Afghan population.

The Taliban’s bans on many forms of women’s employment have added to the crisis by violating their rights to an adequate standard of living and depriving them and their families of needed income. Women have been banned from most civil service jobs, from employment with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and the United Nations except for specific positions in health care and education, and from some private sector jobs.

Because only women can interview women in their homes about their needs and those of their children, Taliban restrictions have obstructed efforts by humanitarian aid organizations to carry out assessments in communities to identify those in need of aid and the kinds of assistance required, and to deliver assistance equitably. Taliban regulations, in particular compelling female healthcare workers to be accompanied by a mahram (male relative guardian) while traveling or in some instances during work hours, and the imposition of strict hijab rules have created onerous obstacles for women delivering and receiving health care.

The Taliban, by imposing bans on secondary and university education for girls and women, have denied them their rights to education and health and effectively guaranteed that shortages of female healthcare workers will continue for the foreseeable future. The Taliban have also failed to allocate adequate resources to public health; like the previous government, they have instead relied on donors to fill what has become a widening gap in Afghans’ access to affordable health care.

The collapse of the former government and loss of development and security assistance across all sectors also led to widespread unemployment, as many jobs in the civil service and with NGOs disappeared overnight. While Afghans living in poverty have always faced difficulties accessing health care because of costs, a rising number of Afghans now struggle to pay for food and are often unable to cover the price of medicines and transportation to reach health services.

Among those most affected by Afghanistan’s economic crisis are people with disabilities. Due to decades of conflict and poor maternal health, Afghanistan has one of the largest populations in the world of people with disabilities. Because of aid shortfalls, some NGOs that had provided services for people with disabilities no longer do. Some Afghans who had served in the previous government’s armed forces and who acquired disabilities from the war have lost access to the financial benefits they previously received. The Taliban’s policies banning women from traveling and in some cases working without a mahram have also had a particularly detrimental impact on women with disabilities and on women caring for others with disabilities, including on their ability to access services and benefits.

The serious rights violations described in this report derive both from the collapse of Afghanistan’s economy and public health system and the impact of the Taliban’s abusive policies and practices. Actions taken by the United States and other governments in August 2021 to cut off Afghanistan’s Central Bank from the international banking system, ongoing difficulties with banking despite clarification of the limited scope of sanctions, and the sudden loss of foreign spending delivered a critical shock to the economy from which it is still suffering. At the same time, the Taliban have allocated little to public health and have erected oppressive obstacles to training and deploying healthcare workers, especially women. The Taliban have been responsible for violating the rights of women and girls to health care, education, and livelihoods. These abuses have exacerbated Afghanistan’s economic crisis, thus prolonging the threat to Afghans’ rights to livelihoods and an adequate standard of living long into the future.

Taliban’s International Legal Obligations

As the authorities maintaining effective control in Afghanistan, the Taliban have international legal obligations under international human rights law. Under international human rights law, every person has the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the right to nondiscrimination, the right to an adequate standard of living including the right to food, and the right to freedom of movement, among other fundamental rights.

These rights are guaranteed by core international treaties to which Afghanistan is a party, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

The right to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health is guaranteed by several treaties. This right not only includes the prevention, treatment and control of diseases, but “the creation of conditions which would assure to all medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness.”

General Comment 14 of the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights states that the right to health is “an inclusive right extending not only to timely and appropriate health care but also to the underlying determinants of health such as … access to health related education and information, including on sexual and reproductive health.”

On nondiscrimination and equal treatment, the Committee said that:

the Covenant proscribes any discrimination in access to health care and underlying determinants of health, as well as to means and entitlements for their procurement, on the grounds of race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, physical or mental disability, health status (including HIV/AIDS), sexual orientation and civil, political, social or other status, which has the intention or effect of nullifying or impairing the equal enjoyment or exercise of the right to health.

The Committee noted that:

many measures, such as most strategies and programs designed to eliminate health-related discrimination can be pursued with minimum resource implications through the adoption, modification or abrogation of legislation or the dissemination of information. … [E]ven in times of severe resource constraints, the vulnerable members of society must be protected by the adoption of relatively low cost targeted programs.

With respect to the right to health, equality of access to health care and health services has to be emphasized. Governments have a special obligation to prevent any discrimination in the provisions of health care and health services, especially with respect of the core obligations of the right to health.

Access to health cannot be limited on the basis of discrimination. All people must be able to access health care, regardless of gender, ethnicity, sexual identity, poverty or other status.

The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities makes clear that governments “shall take all appropriate measures to ensure access for persons with disabilities to health services that are gender-sensitive, including health-related rehabilitation.”

Recommendations

Human Rights Watch has reported on serious human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law by the Taliban before and since their takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021. We have concluded that the Taliban’s violations of the rights of women and girls amount to the crime against humanity of persecution based on gender. In addition to Taliban bans on secondary and university education, many forms of employment, and restrictions on freedom of movement, the barriers women face to accessing health services compound Afghanistan’s healthcare crisis by reducing the availability and accessibility of healthcare goods and services for women and girls.

The Taliban’s miniscule spending on health care has exacerbated the harmful impact of Afghanistan’s aid dependency. For many years Afghanistan has been among the lowest-ranked countries in terms of the percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) it spends on public health, falling far below what the World Health Organization (WHO) has found necessary to ensure universal health coverage.

While donor support for Afghanistan, including for the healthcare sector, was shrinking even before the 2021 takeover, the Taliban’s disregard of widespread international pressure to reverse their repressive policies and end their violations of women and girls’ rights may deter some donors from considering development funding for programs in Afghanistan. The US and other governments established the Swiss-based Fund for the Afghan People to preserve and protect US$3.5 billion in frozen assets that were transferred to it, and to utilize some of those assets in support of Afghanistan’s macroeconomic stability. However, the Fund has yet to disburse any funds to Afghanistan’s central bank. Efforts to provide technical assistance to Afghanistan’s central bank (Da Afghanistan Bank) have not been successful, as the bank has yet to pass critical audits and provide other assurances of its autonomy from the Taliban. Despite the political impasse, many donors have increasingly recognized that while aid has mitigated the worst effects of the humanitarian crisis in the short term, it is insufficient to stabilize Afghanistan’s economy, support livelihoods, and provide adequate public health care.

To the Taliban:

Remove all restrictions that impede or delay people’s access to health care and humanitarian aid, including for women and girls, and continue to allow and facilitate timely and dignified access to health care, without conditionality.

Repeal all decrees and policies violating the rights of women and girls, including those listed below. Immediately end bans on women’s employment in all sectors and lift all restrictions on women’s freedom of movement, including mahram requirements.

Consistent with the WHO benchmark of 5 percent of GDP, progressively increase funding for the public health system, especially in the areas of sexual and reproductive health care, child nutrition, and disease prevention. Expand and improve primary healthcare facilities, especially in underserved rural areas.

Immediately end bans on secondary and university education for women and girls. Ensure that schools teach a curriculum designed to equip both girls and boys for careers that include working as doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals. Allow female graduates to take their exit exams so as to be able to work in the health sector. Expand opportunities for girls and women to prepare for careers in health care.

Allow female health workers to travel in mobile clinics to reach underserved communities. Improve outreach and access to health care, including psychosocial support.

Ensure that people with disabilities, including those who served in the armed forces of the previous government, have access to targeted community outreach and social services, and financial assistance on an equal basis with others.

To Donor Countries:

Seek opportunities to coordinate and work in concert to press Taliban leaders to remove all restrictions that impede or delay people’s access to health care and humanitarian aid and revoke decrees and policies violating the rights of women and girls, especially those affecting access to health care.

Increase and sustain funding for the Afghan healthcare system to meet immediate needs and work toward supporting long-term measures for sustainable healthcare delivery. This should include funding improvements to service delivery, such as trained medical and professional personnel and healthcare infrastructure, especially facilities that provide primary services, those in rural districts, and those aimed at providing services to women, children, and people with disabilities on an equal basis with others, as well as targeted services for those with disabilities.

Address Afghanistan’s economic crisis by supporting measures to normalize payments and other transactions through Afghanistan’s banking system. The United States and other governments should continue to apply measures such as sanctions on individuals designed to pressure Taliban leaders to end their abuses. But the US and other governments should redouble efforts to reach agreements with authorities to allow monitored international transactions involving the Afghan Fund and central bank meant to facilitate banking liquidity and legitimate financial transactions, including those for humanitarian aid and trade.

Help restore public services in the areas of water management, irrigation, and agriculture that are essential to restart the economy, address income-related poverty, and improve non-medical health indicators vital to the social determinants of health, including sanitation, climate adaptation, and food availability.

Increase support for training and education programs for girls and women in health-related fields through scholarships, alternative learning programs, and other available means.

Support and expand services for people with disabilities in Afghanistan, including through psychosocial counseling programs.

Support expanded humanitarian cargo flights to bring in needed medicines.

Methodology

Human Rights Watch carried out research for this report between February 2023 and January 2024. The report is based on a total of 46 remote interviews, using secure communications, with NGO officials, healthcare workers, and adults seeking health care in 16 provinces of Afghanistan, including the major cities of Herat, Kabul, Kandahar, and Mazar-e Sharif, and rural areas of Sar-e Pul, Bamiyan, Daikundi, Ghor, Helmand, Kapisa, Kunduz, Nangarhar, Paktia, Parwan, Takhar, and Uruzgan. Fifteen of the interviews, 12 women and 3 men, were with Afghans who had sought health care. Of the Afghan healthcare officials interviewed, 10 were women and 8 were men. We also reviewed reports on Afghanistan’s healthcare system by government sources and international humanitarian organizations.

Interviews were conducted in Dari and Pashto with the informed consent of the interviewee. The names of the interviewees and specific location information have been withheld to protect their identities.

All interviewees were informed of the purpose of the interview, the ways in which the information would be used, and offered anonymity in our reporting. In some cases, we have used pseudonyms, which appear in quotation marks, to anonymize individuals for their security. None of the interviewees received financial or other incentives for speaking with us.

On January 9, 2023, Human Rights Watch sent a summary of our findings to the Taliban authorities in Kabul. As of publication we had not received a response. Our letter appears in appendix 1.

I. Afghanistan’s Aid Dependency

The Afghan reconstruction effort that followed the United States-led invasion in 2001 pumped billions of dollars into the new Afghan state. For the next two decades, spending by foreign armies, funding of the security services, and international development aid supported a bloated service-led economy and paid for most public services. While Afghanistan had been dependent on foreign aid to pay for its security and development since at least the mid-20th century, and on other forms of external funding going back to its beginnings as a nation-state, the volume of aid after 2001 dwarfed all previous assistance. International military spending in-country dropped sharply after the end of the “surge” in 2011, with most NATO forces withdrawing by the end of 2014. However, development and security assistance still financed more than 75 percent of total public expenditure through the first half of 2021, including around 50 percent of the national budget.

Prior to 2001, Afghanistan had some of the worst health indicators in the world. The minimal facilities that then existed, some of which were ostensibly provided by the Taliban authorities that ruled most of Afghanistan between 1996 and 2001, were staffed and supported financially by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Between 2002 and early 2021, the World Bank, the US Agency for International Development (USAID), and the European Union funded much of Afghanistan’s primary public healthcare system (through the Basic Package of Healthcare Services), paying for international and national NGOs to implement the Ministry of Public Health’s primary health programs. This did not include private healthcare providers. Thus, while external donors funded a weak network of nonprofit providers that offered economically accessible health care, the Afghan government itself spent very little on the healthcare system. In this highly regressive model of healthcare financing, Afghans paying out-of-pocket represented the largest percentage of healthcare costs, including for transportation to access treatment not available in rural areas.

By 2009, NGOs were delivering basic health services in up to 30 provinces, funded by USAID, the World Bank, and the European Commission. While increased aid led to a four-fold increase in the number of primary health facilities between 2001 and 2014, gains were not even across provinces. Rural areas where the conflict was most intense continued to lack qualified health workers, and female staff in particular. Due to corruption, a number of clinics constructed with donor money in some districts were empty: ghost clinics with no staff. In rural areas, where conflict was prolonged and intense, such as Helmand, there were few clinics.

Although the donor-funded public health system was meant to provide at least primary care for free, most healthcare costs were paid by individuals, and the private health sector was larger than the public system. Hence, even before the Afghan economy collapsed in 2021, poverty was a consistent and growing obstacle to accessing health care, due largely to out-of-pocket costs for fees and medicines.

In 2019, healthcare costs in Afghanistan amounted to $2.8 billion, 20 percent of which was provided by donors, and only about 3 percent by the government. Out-of-pocket spending by Afghans on health accounted for nearly 77 percent of all healthcare spending. The sudden end to most foreign spending sent the economy into a freefall. With the breakdown of the economy, most Afghans could no longer afford the out-of-pocket health costs they previously bore. Afghanistan’s economic crisis has driven more people into poverty and precarity, making the healthcare system based on out-of-pocket expenditures even more regressive, further infringing on the right to health.

The overnight disappearance of millions of jobs and a multi-year drought contributed to the crisis, leaving millions of Afghans unable to buy enough food to feed their families or pay out-of-pocket costs for health care. A 54-year-old man living in Herat said, “I have always been under treatment for my kidney infection. Since the Taliban took over, the prices of my medications have nearly doubled. This is too much for anyone who doesn’t have a job.”

Humanitarian officials have said that the needs of the Afghan population after 2021 have grown beyond what humanitarian organizations could manage. At a panel in September 2023, Mercy Corps country director for Afghanistan Dayne Curry said:

The humanitarian response in Afghanistan simply cannot keep pace with the country’s worsening conditions. …These needs skyrocketed with the collapse of the former government and the subsequent suspension of international aid. Two years later, shocks from recurrent drought and seasonal flooding continue to threaten Afghanistan’s critical agriculture sector and limit access to clean water. Additionally, policies restricting individual freedoms, particularly those of women and girls, impede the humanitarian response, and Afghanistan’s authorities lack the capacity to provide services to their people. Compounding these challenges is the reality of the international community’s declining commitment to Afghanistan.

At the same panel, Becky Roby of the Norwegian Refugee Council said:

While humanitarian actors provide life-saving assistance, these interventions cannot by themselves improve the situation for affected Afghans, leaving the population trapped in a cycle of repeated, protracted crises.

As Emergency, a humanitarian NGO, noted in a 2023 report: “In a country that formerly depended on international aid for 75 percent of public spending, the impact of reduced funding on Afghan civilians, who are bearing the brunt of a rise in poverty and a dearth of essential services, is severe.” The International Committee of the Red Cross was one of the first organizations to sound the alarm, saying in October 2021 that aid groups on their own could not avert a humanitarian crisis, and again in January 2022 that “the humanitarian system cannot replace institutional service delivery systems for 40 million people.”

II. Aid Cutbacks and Loss of Funding

After the initial loss of foreign aid in August 2021 caused an economic freefall, donors in response provided a temporary increase in humanitarian aid, some of which went to the health sector. Since the end of 2022, however, international and local humanitarian organizations have experienced funding cuts that have adversely affected health care. The reduction in aid and loss of funding has had a profound and immediate impact on the right to health for people in Afghanistan, while the overarching economic crisis has severely limited people’s ability to meet their needs and pushed them further into poverty. In August 2023, the World Food Program in Afghanistan removed from its assistance programs 18 million people experiencing “serious food insecurity” and 3.4 million people experiencing “critical food insecurity” because funding appeals had fallen short. These cuts came on top of earlier reductions in June 2023 that removed eight million food-insecure Afghans from assistance, and another 1.4 million new and expecting mothers and children from malnutrition treatment because of a downturn in international funding.

Local health NGOs have been hit hardest by funding cuts. Most used to be part of the Sehatmandi program, a US$600 million World Bank-directed program under which the Ministry of Public Health contracted with NGOs to provide healthcare services. After the Taliban takeover and the loss of funding for Sehatmandi, a number of interim measures were put in place, including short-term contracts with NGOs through UN agencies, including the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF). However the disruptions led some local health facilities to close. As of the end of 2023, UN agencies, multilateral donors, international health organizations, and Taliban authorities had yet to agree on a new health sector strategy, and the role local groups would play in that.

Decisions by governments and international banking institutions not to deal directly with Afghan commercial banks or the Central Bank of Afghanistan because of sanctions imposed by the US and other countries have exacerbated the crisis. Although subsequent clarifications of the sanctions regime explicitly state that humanitarian aid is exempted, as well as most commercial transactions and payment of normal taxes and fees to Afghan government agencies, staff of aid organizations have said that problems with transferring and withdrawing funds have continued. As the international humanitarian medical organization Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) noted in February 2023: “Economic, banking and liquidity challenges are at the heart of the current humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and greatly contribute to the difficulties people face in accessing and affording essential services, including healthcare.”

Because of the fear of sanctions, many international banks have often not covered withdrawals by aid organizations. Even when funds have been transmitted electronically into banks, liquidity remains a serious problem for local NGOs, which do not receive payments directly from UN agencies. Taliban authorities have also set limits on withdrawals that have fluctuated over time, further complicating the situation. A staff member of an Afghan NGO said, “Purchasing [supplies] locally is a nightmare with the current banking system.""

Loss of Hospital Support

After the Taliban takeover, Afghan hospitals faced a sharp reduction in funds (which had been provided in large part through the former government’s budget), coupled with the loss of staff who had fled the country or stopped working out of fear or cuts in pay. In September 2021, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) stepped in to replace the Afghan budget funding, providing support to 33 provincial-level public hospitals that were previously funded by the former government’s Ministry of Public Health, paying the salaries of 10,900 Afghan doctors, nurses, and staff, and the costs of drugs, medical supplies, electricity, ambulance services, lab tests, and food for patients. Explaining the move, the ICRC said that it took the decision “to save the healthcare system from collapsing.” The support program lasted two years until the ICRC began to face its own funding shortfall. In April 2023, the Taliban’s Ministry of Public Health assumed responsibility for eight of the 33 hospitals, with other public hospitals anticipated to make the transition in subsequent months. In August 2023, when announcing an end to the program, a spokesperson for the ICRC said, ""[T]he ICRC does not have the mandate nor the resources to maintain a fully functioning public health-care sector in the longer term."" As of September 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) had increased its support to the hospitals by supplying essential medicine and supplies, and UNICEF has assumed responsibility for NGO contracts. WHO has urged donors to help sustain the hospitals with humanitarian assistance.

Humanitarian aid organizations working in Afghanistan have told Human Rights Watch that they also plan to close hospitals and reduce operations because of inadequate funding. One official working with an international humanitarian organization said: “All donors have been cutting aid…. We closed some mobile teams because donors cut aid. We may need to close 10 major hospitals in the next six months.” The US Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction reported that in 2023, “262 static and mobile health facilities and 173 mobile health and nutrition teams were discontinued” due to lack of funds.

In response to the impact of the projected shortfall in funding, Dr. Luo Dapeng, the WHO’s Afghanistan representative, said, “For a country already affected by decades of conflict, underfunding of the healthcare system is a critical humanitarian concern.” Even as healthcare facilities have lost funding and have had to downsize in terms of staff, they are seeing an increase in the number of patients. There are several reasons for this. One is an increase in illnesses linked to poor nutrition. In 2022, Afghanistan suffered a severe measles epidemic directly linked to malnutrition among children as well as a drop in vaccinations. Healthcare workers have also reported an increase in diarrhea and respiratory diseases linked to poor nutrition, especially among children.

According to the UN, as of October 2023, an estimated four million Afghans were suffering from acute malnutrition, including over 875,000 children under 5 suffering from severe acute malnutrition, and some 804,000 pregnant and lactating women from under nutrition. The incidence of life-threatening diseases, particularly among children, including measles, respiratory infections, and diarrheal diseases has also increased. In February 2023, WFP said that Afghanistan was at its highest risk of famine in 25 years—not from a lack of food, but from lack of money to buy it.

As the number of primary health facilities has shrunk because of the loss of staff and funds, secondary and tertiary health facilities are seeing patients who should be seen by primary care workers. The head of an international humanitarian organization said:

Due to cuts in funding and no development aid, a fragile health system [like this] can’t respond to the public—there’s no proper [primary] medical care. Twenty-five percent of patients arriving at the emergency room arrive from districts, and the vast majority shouldn’t have come to us. But they have no other option. The increased number of patients overwhelms the facilities—it puts the hospital at the risk of collapse. We need to make sure that people have access to primary health care.

As one example, an aid worker said that of the thousands of births at maternity hospitals in Afghanistan, a quarter were complicated deliveries. “The rest should have found a facility to deliver near home, but they couldn’t.” At the same time, another healthcare worker said, “Women are dying of home delivery because of a lack health services.”

An official with an international healthcare organization said: “Since the Taliban takeover, the health system has been severely impacted. Our family planning clients have increased by 50 percent because they first go to primary health facilities, and those facilities can't provide the necessary care and medicines, so they all come to us.”

The lack of adequate primary health care is also due to Taliban policies. Like their predecessors, Taliban health officials often reveal a preference for bricks-and-mortar healthcare improvements—like tertiary care hospitals—over primary care clinics or community-based care. One healthcare worker said that Taliban authorities’ demands on them to “build a hospital” were often “not realistic,” and they had to “work our way around it and negotiate.”

Relative calm in areas that had seen intense fighting for many years has meant that more people now travel for health care, when in previous years they would not have taken the chance. An official with an international humanitarian organization said:

We have access [now] to areas that we didn’t have access to previously, and now we see that there is a huge need in those areas. Provinces or districts which used to be unsafe [during the fighting] either don’t have a facility or need to strengthen their facility. There is now pressure 0n international NGOs to provide for the population in those places.

Shortages of Medicine and Supplies

Many staff working with local Afghan humanitarian organizations told Human Rights Watch that since the Taliban takeover it has become a challenge to import medicine into the country and that they have faced shortages as a result. Problems with the banking system and frequent disruptions to cross-border trade with neighboring countries such as Pakistan have exacerbated the situation.

The import of pharmaceuticals in Afghanistan has always been poorly regulated. The prevalence of poor quality and smuggled drugs led most international NGOs to bring in their own supplies after 2001. With many medicines increasingly difficult to obtain, smuggling has reportedly increased since 2021, and unregulated pharmaceuticals from China, Iran, India, and Pakistan are widely available in private pharmacies.

One official with an international organization said that while they would rather use local suppliers, the quality of the drugs is a concern: “The Ministry of Public Health’s lab, which is responsible to check the quality of medicines, doesn’t have the necessary material to [run the] tests.”

Some organizations also raised concerns about corruption in the distribution of medicine donated to the ministry. “The right people are not there to distribute and if it goes to private pharmacies, that’s an issue.”

Many local organizations said importing medicine is a problem. Larger humanitarian organizations that bring in their own medicines can ensure quality control, but smaller organizations cannot. One official from an international organization said: “Bringing medicine is not an issue for us, but it is for the local NGOs and private clinics. It’s difficult to import with fewer flights, and humanitarian cargo flights can’t bring enough. Also, there is not enough money to buy.”

Ahmad Naderi, who has worked with a medicine distribution project in Bamiyan since 2014, said, ""Our contract is the same, and we still receive the same package, but it isn’t enough [anymore] as our clients’ needs, which are usually local clinics, have tripled since the previous government collapsed. The ongoing humanitarian crisis has impacted everyone’s lives, and people are in greater need of health services and medicines.""

Extreme Poverty and Worsening Malnutrition

The dire economic situation in Afghanistan has contributed to extreme poverty and widespread malnutrition, which in turn has had profound effects on the country's already fragile health system. According to humanitarian organizations, malnutrition rates, which were already very high in the last years of the former government, especially among children, have increased. Inadequate access to food, clean water, and healthcare services has also led to a rise in preventable diseases. This has placed a strain on an already struggling health system as it grapples with an increased demand, including greater need for specialized care for people with acute forms of malnutrition. According to the UN, as of September 2023, more than 28 million people—two-thirds of Afghanistan’s population—required humanitarian assistance. More than 15 million Afghans were living in a state of acute hunger, while 2.8 million were experiencing critical or emergency levels of hunger. A staff member for a local humanitarian organization said:

While the World Health Organization does provide some support to families living below the poverty line, their efforts are unfortunately inadequate to cover the vast number of individuals in need. This assistance only reaches a quarter of those facing dire circumstances, leaving a significant portion of the population without the crucial aid they require.

While some organizations are trying to mitigate the crisis, they also confirm that the needs are beyond what they can provide. A humanitarian aid worker in Kabul said:

I met a woman who had a malnourished baby, and she kept coming back to our facility every month, taking medicine and food for the malnourished child while the child was not gaining any weight. While I asked her the reason, she told me that she's dividing the food among three children.

Many people are unable to reach public healthcare facilities because of the financial constraints associated with transportation. Because as in many countries, women and girls are often expected to eat last and less in households, and families are less likely to pay transportation costs and medical fees to access care for women and girls, they are disproportionately at risk of malnutrition and diseases linked to it, while also less likely to receive care. MSF reported that in 2022:

Girls accounted for around 55 percent of admissions to both the outpatient therapeutic feeding programme and the [Inpatient Therapeutic Feeding Centre] ITFC, with mortality almost 90 percent higher for girls than for boys. … When there is not enough food for everyone in a household, women and girls may be deprioritized… a family may seek care faster for a boychild than a girl.

Humanitarian groups have also reported an increase in malnutrition among pregnant and lactating women. The country director of a humanitarian organization in Mazar-e Sharif said that at one of his organization’s clinics, a pregnant woman told him, “We don’t have enough food and only eat bread and tea.”

III. Taliban Violations of Women’s and Girls’ Rights as Obstacles to Health Care

The Taliban have systematically violated women’s rights in most aspects of their lives, including their rights to free movement, to employment in many fields, and access to health care. Women who have sought health care and health care providers have described how these rights violations have created major barriers to their obtaining medical treatment, especially in rural areas, and to their accessing humanitarian assistance, including assistance essential for their health. These barriers violate their right to health and contravene principles of gender equality and non-discrimination, perpetuating inequality.

Bans on Women Working for the United Nations and International Organizations

On December 24, 2022, Taliban officials announced a ban on women working with international humanitarian organizations in Afghanistan, claiming that they were doing so because female staff were not sufficiently observing hijab and workplaces were not fully segregated by gender. The Taliban’s Ministry of Economy announced the ban in a letter to the Agency Coordinating Body for Afghan Relief and Development (ACBAR), which represents over 180 NGOs working in Afghanistan. In the letter, the Taliban authorities threatened to revoke the operating licenses of organizations that did not comply with the ban. On April 4, 2023, Taliban authorities clarified that this ban also barred Afghan women from working in UN offices in the country.

In response to international pressure to reverse the ban, Taliban authorities have delimited exemptions for women to work in some positions in the fields of health, nutrition, and education. However, the Taliban have never set out these exemptions in written form, leading to concern among some aid workers and activists that they are subject to interpretation by local Taliban officials and could be withdrawn at any time. “Nooria S.,” a healthcare worker in Chimtal district of Balkh province said, “We work today but there’s no guarantee that we will work tomorrow.

Moreover, Taliban security forces and officials with the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice have also at times enforced the ban even in usually exempted positions in these sectors, as described below. Afghan women employed by the UN and international organizations in health and education have continued to face restrictions on their freedom of movement and dress.

Mahram and Hijab Requirements

On December 26, 2021, the Taliban issued a directive stating that women and girls travelling “long distances” should not be allowed in taxis or public transport unless accompanied by a male relative acting as a chaperone (mahram). The directive specified the distance as 72 kilometers, but some Taliban officials and security forces have interpreted it to mean much shorter distances as well, including any travel outside the home—such as commuting to work or traveling to get medical care. In Ghazni province in January 2022, some Taliban officials prevented women from attending healthcare appointments unless they were accompanied by a mahram. On May 7, 2022, the Taliban issued another directive stating that women and adolescent girls should cover themselves from head to toe, including the face, and avoid leaving their homes. It said the male relatives of women and girls would be held responsible and face punishment in cases of women and girls not dressing “appropriately.”

As a result, in some provinces, female staff working for NGOs have been able to work only if they are accompanied by a mahram during working hours. For example, an official with an NGO in Kandahar told Human Rights Watch that their female staff needed to have a mahram accompanying them all day. He said that female patients also need to be accompanied by a mahram; without one they would be denied access to healthcare services. Other healthcare providers have described similar experiences. In a 2023 report, an MSF staff member said:

Already I see that the Taliban at checkpoints looking for any excuse to prevent women from moving freely. For example, my sister was sick recently and when she was travelling to our hospital for a check-up, they did not allow her to go because she didn’t have a mahram. She stood there for about 50 minutes, outside in the cold. Then my brother came, and they allowed them to leave.

“Sharifa M.,” a doctor in Samangan, said: “The Taliban have instructed us not to treat any female patients who is not accompanied by a mahram or is not in full hijab.” These restrictions seem to be implemented with particular severity outside major urban areas in the southern provinces and rural areas of Afghanistan. The requirement that a woman bring a mahram with her to healthcare appointments not only obstructs her ability to access health care but also violates her right to privacy by likely obliging her to disclose what may be private medical information to the family member.

In some hospitals and clinics, both female patients and healthcare workers need to be accompanied by a mahram. A humanitarian organization in Zabul said that all their female staff colleagues generally need to be accompanied by a mahram. As a result, skilled female healthcare workers cannot work in many areas because they do not have a mahram to accompany them while travelling or to places of work.

Male doctors are not allowed to see female patients. Families may also not allow their female relatives to seek medical care if the medical staff are all male. An NGO staff member said that two months after the Taliban takeover, Taliban security forces beat a male doctor “for providing health services to female patients in a village of Samangan province.”

While some organizations have managed to continue their operations without adhering to the mahram rule, a country director for one organization made clear that to do so is precarious:

The policy is for women to be accompanied by a mahram when they work. In cases where some organizations, including ours, have been able to negotiate on the local level and continue operations without these restrictions, that’s a violation of the Taliban’s policy, not the rule.

Humanitarian organizations also raised concern about the lack of clarity on these rules and the fact that they can differ depending on location. For example, in some provinces, women healthcare staff can move around without mahrams. In others, humanitarian aid groups need to establish segregated offices separating female and male staff.

In Kunduz, clinics with all-women staff—from doctors to pharmacists to reception—have not faced any problems. One aid official described the variations: “In Khost, our female staff are required to wear burqas while on the job and a face mask, and their offices should be separated from male staff. In Nangarhar, we should have entirely separate buildings for female and male staff.”

A staff member of another organization said:

In Faryab and Jawzjan, the Taliban issued an appreciation certificate recognizing the work of female workers to our provincial coordinators, who are female. But in Kunduz, the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice didn't allow our female staff to attend meetings with the health department. In other provinces where the Taliban need to bring their wives for family planning, they allow our female pharmacists, technicians, and receptionist to work.

The director of an international humanitarian organization said that in one province, his organization was able to negotiate with local Taliban authorities to allow female staff to be picked up by their mahrams after working hours ended, so as to not have them stay with them all day.

Over the years, NGOs have operated mobile clinics in rural areas, or provided transportation for staff to travel to rural areas to provide health care. The Taliban’s restrictions have severely limited mobile services to prevent female staff from traveling in vehicles and to reduce door-to-door services that involve community health practitioners visiting private homes. Taliban security forces have sometimes stopped mobile teams at police stations and checkpoints to see if staff have mahrams. According to humanitarian organizations, officials of the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice have established checkpoints in some areas specifically for the purpose of checking for mahrams and hijabs. An official with a humanitarian organization said: “We had cases where if one person doesn’t have mahram, they [Taliban authorities] sent us letters, saying that if we don’t observe the rule, they will stop our activities.” In some areas, Taliban officials have required mahrams to have an ID card to identify himself as the mahram of a specific female employee; the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice has issued these cards in some districts but not uniformly. An official with an international humanitarian organization based in Afghanistan said:

Because women can’t go to male [healthcare workers], in Logar province, our mobile team has to travel three hours distance there and back; they can’t go without mahram, which is a big problem. There are female healthcare workers who are very skilled but don’t have a mahram and can’t work.

One health worker said that her organization tried to negotiate having a mobile team made up of a driver, midwife, and nurse, but the Taliban stopped them. The result has been that communities in remote areas no longer have access to these services. A health worker at an international aid group said: “Before the takeover, we had 2,500 female staff who used to go house to house, providing community services, and distributing hygiene kits. Now all these programs including our mental health programs have stopped.”

Organizations have also raised concerns about a lack of understanding about the importance of community health services by the Taliban. An aid worker said: “We are not allowed to distribute hygiene kits; a lack of those leads to increased urinary tract infections (UTIs) and problems with childbirth…. they don’t understand that this is not a luxury; it’s a basic need for women.”

In one province, the Taiban have told UNICEF to train men on breastfeeding, and then those men could train their wives at home.

An official with a humanitarian organization said the loss of community health services was likely to lead to outbreaks of preventable diseases:

We now have to restrict ourselves in stopping at our delivery points [rather than go to homes], and we are beginning to see our numbers [of patients] decreasing. …They can’t come to us and the number of diseases are going to increase. Infectious diseases are preventable on a community level but with these restrictions it’s difficult.

The restrictions have also added to costs. According to a staff member of an international NGO in Kabul, normally, “a mobile team consisted of a counselor, midwife, nutrition expert, and doctor. Now we need to have one mahram for every one of them. We need to hire another car, that means extra cost, and we also need to provide per diem for their mahrams.”

Organizations have also reported that the Taliban have advised them to transfer their mobile teams to established clinics, even where none exist. The country director of an international NGO in Afghanistan said that not only did they not have the capacity, the donors would not be flexible for such changes. “We can’t construct places. … We spend so much time trying to explain what we do and why we do it.”

The Taliban’s new restrictions have compounded longstanding problems of access to medical care in rural areas. In remote areas like Daikundi, where access has always been difficult because of poor roads, or in Badakhshan where heavy snow often makes the roads impassable, women already needed to travel long distances to access health services. Because of the mahram requirement, this has now has become more difficult.

Imposition of hijab rules has also impeded access to health care. A staff member at a humanitarian organization said:

The situation is really bad. My sister is in Samangan and she’s the only healthcare trainer. The Taliban went to her clinic and my sister wanted to speak to them. They put a curtain in front of her. If someone comes and is dying and doesn’t have full hijab, you can’t treat her.

IV. Education Ban and Shortage of Female Healthcare Workers

On December 20, 2022, Taliban authorities banned women from public and private universities, including medical training programs. The ban has exacerbated the crisis created by the prohibition on girls’ attending secondary school – even if girls and women were allowed to resume higher-level education programs, none would currently have the high school educational requirements for medical training. As the head of one international humanitarian organization said, “If patients can’t get treatment today, what will happen in the future when half of all potential medical students are not allowed to study?”

As of January 2024, none of the university programs had reopened for women, although midwife and nursing training programs run by NGOs have continued.

The Taliban’s bans have compounded longstanding shortages of female doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals, a deficit acutely felt in rural areas.

The lack of female healthcare providers has had dire consequences, particularly given Afghanistan's already high rates of maternal mortality and the prevalence of preventable diseases among women and children. According to WHO, even before the Taliban takeover, Afghanistan had one of the highest rates of maternal deaths per capita in Asia. As of 2023, the ranking stayed the same, but healthcare officials have raised concerns that the failure to train new female healthcare professionals and specialists in obstetrics and gynecology means that the maternity death rate could rise.

Hospitals and clinics in Afghanistan have reported their difficulties in hiring female doctors and other health professionals. The director of an international health NGO said of its operations in Kandahar:

We had to announce a female doctor’s vacancy 20 times, and yet there’s no one to fill the position. …No female doctor has graduated in the past two years. I am scared of the day, like when in 2005, when we used to bring doctors from Tajikistan, that we will end up this way. We can’t find qualified doctors.

An organization in Paktika had to re-advertise one female doctor vacancy many times in six months, and as of January 2024 still had not been able to fill it because of the lack of women applicants willing to work in rural areas. In addition, women who had recently completed medical school but have been unable to graduate has exacerbated the problem. The country director for an international aid group said, “We have hundreds of qualified female healthcare workers who are ready to join the system but can’t because of the Taliban’s restriction on them taking their exit [licensing] exams.”

An international healthcare organization representative said that most female doctors in Afghanistan were trained to work in maternity wards, leaving a lack of female doctors in other specializations. This shortage “has far-reaching implications for women's health care and access to specialized medical services.”

The shortage of female healthcare professionals poses a significant threat to the sustainability of Afghanistan's public health system. The ban on girls' education has a cascading impact on the healthcare system, particularly for women. Preventing girls from attending secondary school deprives them of knowledge about basic health care as well as the education needed to progress to tertiary levels. Women who lack access to education may be less able to make knowledgeable decisions about their own or their children’s health, which could contribute to insufficient or delayed care.

This restriction has contributed to unequal access to health care, barriers to seeking medical assistance, and a shortage of qualified healthcare workers. The country director of an international humanitarian organization said, “Afghanistan has always had a shortage of qualified female doctors and nurses, and with the current ban on education for women, it’s going to be a disaster for the foreseeable future.""

V. People with Disabilities and Mental Health Conditions

Among those most affected by Afghanistan’s economic crisis are people with disabilities. Because of aid shortfalls, many NGOs no longer provide the few targeted services some of them had previously offered specifically for people with disabilities. The Taliban’s policies banning women and adolescent girls from traveling, and in some cases working, without a mahram have also had a particularly detrimental impact on women and adolescent girls with disabilities and on women supporting others with disabilities. These developments underscore the urgent need for targeted interventions to safeguard the rights of the most marginalized groups and ensure their equal access to essential services, in accordance with international human rights standards.

Afghanistan has one of the largest populations per capita of persons with disabilities in the world. A 2019 Asia Foundation survey found that roughly four out of every five Afghan adults, and one out of five children, had a disability, whether physical, sensory, intellectual, or psychosocial. Afghanistan’s prolonged decades-long conflict resulted in over one million Afghans experiencing limb amputations and other impairments affecting mobility, sight, or hearing. A 2005 study found that 67 percent of Afghans reported experiencing the effects of trauma or other psychosocial conditions, with the unemployed, older persons, and widowed women particularly affected. The study also noted that women with disabilities, regardless of the cause, had a higher prevalence of other mental health conditions. Entrenched discrimination has meant that persons with disabilities have faced significant obstacles to education, employment, and health care, rights guaranteed under international human rights law.

Even before the Taliban takeover, a lack of institutional support and qualified practitioners, as well as inadequate community awareness impeded the provision of treatment and rehabilitative services to people with disabilities. In 2012, Afghanistan ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol. In 2013, the Afghan parliament approved legislation, the Law on Rights and Privileges of Persons with Disabilities, ensuring the rights of persons with disabilities to participate actively in all aspects of society. However, there were very few specialized health or other support services, such as physical rehabilitation, for people with disabilities in Afghanistan, and the demand far outstripped available resources. Neither the previous government nor donors had specifically prioritized ensuring that the health services and other programs they funded were accessible to people with disabilities. NGOs have been supporting some remaining services for people with disabilities, including a school for people with visual disabilities in Kabul, but because of funding cuts many services have shut down.

In addition, as Fayeza Ahmadi, who formerly ran an NGO to provide services for people with disabilities, said, most of these programs were short term. The departure of skilled professionals after August 2021 has exacerbated the situation, particularly for those people requiring services for physical rehabilitation. Remaining physical rehabilitation services are few and not widely available or accessible. Because many patients have to travel long distances to get services, many forego them altogether. Traveling to obtain services has for many families been complicated by poverty, poor quality roads in remote areas, and above all the cost of transportation. For women and girls, the mahram requirement created an additional obstacle.

The healthcare organization HealthNet estimates that since the Taliban takeover, one in two Afghans has experienced stress, anxiety, or other forms of psychological distress as a result of political violence, instability, and poverty. Access to mental health support has diminished because of a loss of funding from foreign donors for health care in general, with mental health services generally the first to be cut. A counselor based in Kabul said that “even before the Taliban takeover, there were few donors to provide mental health services in major cities. Now most of them are gone, while people are in in greater need.” A lack of female health service providers has meant that women and girls with disabilities have less access to services. UN Women has worked with local partners to make some psychosocial support services available to women, whether in-home or by telephone.

Organizations report that most of the skilled workers who used to work with people with disabilities left the country during evacuations or after the takeover due to security concerns and the economic crisis. There are also fewer resources for prosthetic devices, medicines, and other supplies, and the prices have increased, putting them out of reach for patients and small organizations working with people with disabilities. A psychologist in Herat said that medicines for mental health care are hard to find:

No one imports medicine for mental health, for example, pills that can make the life of a person who experiences anxiety easier. From every 10 cases that I see every day, 6 of them need antidepressants, which you can’t find easily in Afghanistan anymore.

Women and girls with disabilities face compounded challenges due to societal norms, limited support, and Taliban restrictions. Although travel in Afghanistan’s provinces has become easier for men since active fighting ended, the requirement that women and adolescent girls have a mahram has severely hampered mobility for all, including those with disabilities. “Ahmad S.,” who works with an NGO in Mazar-e Sharif, said: “We had beneficiaries from all the provinces, now most of those women can’t come because they need to have a mahram.” Societal norms around gender and disability also limit the family support that women and girls with disabilities receive, leaving them less likely to get necessary health care and other services.

The Taliban’s policies banning women from working for international humanitarian organizations except in some positions in health, nutrition, and education has been an additional factor reducing targeted services for people with disabilities. “Aziza A.”, who had been the deputy director of an organization in Kabul that provided assistance for people with disabilities throughout Afghanistan, has not been able to work in her position since the Taliban issued their ban on women working for international NGOs. “I have worked for the Kabul orthopedic center for more than 20 years,” she said. “Now I can’t be deputy director anymore.”

The Taliban’s policies banning girls and women from secondary and university education and limiting their ability to work have reportedly led to a rise in depression and anxiety among Afghan women and girls, including suicides in some cases. Healthcare workers have reported that many women and girls seeking treatment for other conditions also report feeling anxiety, stress, and other mental health concerns related to restrictions on their freedom of movement and other rights abuses. Women also said their mental health was being affected by experiences of poverty. A local NGO official said: “Most women who come to us for treatment are dealing with several psychological issues but in Afghanistan, mental health is the last thing people think about, and there’s very limited availability of services too.”

Stigma remains another huge barrier blocking people from seeking mental health support. Mental health is considered a taboo topic, and people often hide their concerns and avoid seeking help from their families or from a professional. This longstanding stigma is exacerbated by Taliban restrictions. “Mehria A.”, a woman in Nangarhar, has experienced depression and said that she prefers to be able to seek assistance by herself. However, with the Taliban’s restrictions, she needs to take her brother with her as her mahram when she goes to clinics. “My family won’t understand,” she said. “I wish there were confidential services available for women so I could seek those.” “Palwasha P.”, who has physical disability said, “Poverty and disability are each other’s complement. If they both hit you, it would affect you double. Especially if you are women. … [F]amilies prefer not to take women to healthcare services and if you have disabilities, that’s even worse.”

Another concern that organizations have raised is the lack of any dedicated financial assistance for people with disabilities. Before the Taliban takeover, Afghanistan’s former government provided a small stipend (between US$32 and $66 a month) to people who had acquired a disability as a result of a conflict-related incident. People who had been born with or acquired a disability for reasons other than conflict were not eligible for any financial assistance from the government.

Some Afghans who had received this stipend told Human Rights Watch that after the Taliban takeover, their names have been removed from the official disability list, which used to give them an allowance of up to 60,000 afghanis [$800] a year depending on their disability. Others who had been receiving disability allowances as military veterans and had acquired disabilities as soldiers were afraid to collect their allowance because their identities could be revealed, putting them at risk. According to one disability rights activist, Taliban authorities in charge of the ministry have stopped providing disability certificates to single women and girls.

“Asma J.”, who has previously worked for an NGO in Kabul and has a physical disability, said that since the Taliban took control, she experiences psychological distress:

I went to the Ministry of Economy to extend my disability certificate, and they treated me as if I were not a human being. They didn’t let me sit in the front seats in the lobby; I had to sit at the back. Both my legs were injured in a mine explosion, but I still had to walk two floors and the ministry staff person who was supposed to help me had his back turned to me [so as not to see me]. I used to have a job. Now I have no right to education as a woman—what do I want this life for?

On February 14, 2020, Cameroonian soldiers and armed ethnic Fulani raided Ngarbuh, a village in Cameroon’s North-West province, killing at least 21 civilians, including 13 children and a pregnant woman, and burning and looting homes. It was a brutal day that shocked even those who had long become numb to increasing violence in the region.

The attack was a reprisal against the local community, which was suspected of harboring separatist fighters. The massacre followed a pattern of military abuse against civilians in Cameroon’s Anglophone regions, where for over the last eight years security forces have clashed with armed separatists—themselves responsible for attacks on civilians—who are fighting for independence for the country’s minority English-speaking population.

The government initially denied its security forces were responsible for the massacre, describing allegations against them as fake and launching a smear campaign against rights groups and media who exposed the killings. In March 2020, only after national and international pressure, authorities established a commission of inquiry, which found that the military attempted to cover up their actions and identified three security force members as responsible for the killings. In June 2020, the government announced that the three had been arrested and charged with murder.

In December 2020, a trial opened before a military court in Cameroon’s capital Yaoundé, marking an important step towards accountability for the massacre. However, the trial has dragged on and been marred by irregularities. Hearings have been postponed multiple times, victims’ families have minimal participation in the proceedings, and the court has refused to admit key evidence, including death certificates. Senior officers have not been arrested or charged.

During the last real hearing on the massacre on November 16, 2023, witnesses did speak, and some investigative reports were presented. But since then, the trial has been postponed three times, casting doubt on the ability of the military judicial system to deliver accountability for military abuse. It is scheduled to restart this week.

This trial provides a rare opportunity for justice not only for Ngarbuh’s victims, but for all those who have suffered from military abuse during the crisis in Cameroon’s Anglophone regions. With yet another hearing on the horizon, now is the time for judicial authorities to avoid further delays and commit to deliver justice.",HIGH,20240214T054500Z,Victims' families and human rights organizations,Three security force members identified in the inquiry,Cameroonian military and government,"Ngarbuh, North-West region, Cameroon",Judicial authorities should avoid delays and commit to delivering justice,Massacre of civilians in Ngarbuh,Cameroon,"Clash between security forces and armed separatists, suspected harboring of separatists by local community"

Pregnant or parenting adolescent girls and women drop out of school in Mozambique because they don’t get adequate support from schools.

Girls who become parents often experience discrimination, stigma, and a lack of support and accommodation that makes juggling school and childcare responsibilities impossible. The lack of free education pushes many girls from the poorest households out of school.

Mozambique should adopt legally enforceable regulations to ensure girls’ right to education during pregnancy and parenthood, and provide comprehensive sexuality education and childcare.

(Maputo) – Many adolescent girls and women in Mozambique, who are pregnant or parenting, drop out of school because they face huge barriers and get inadequate support from schools at one of the most vulnerable times in their lives, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. Even though Mozambique’s government revoked discriminatory measures against pregnant students and adolescent mothers over five years ago, many teachers and education and school officials lack clear instructions on protecting their right to education.

The 52-page report, “‘Girls Shouldn’t Give Up On Their Studies’: Pregnant Girls’ and Adolescent Mothers’ Struggle to Stay in School in Mozambique,” documents numerous barriers faced by adolescent girls and women who are pregnant or parenting, and the problems they face when trying to stay in school. Students also lack or are denied access to sexual and reproductive health information, especially comprehensive sexuality education, as well as adolescent-responsive sexual and reproductive health services, including a wide range of contraceptive options and safe, legal abortion to the fullest extent allowed by law.

“Girls who become parents at a very young age often experience discrimination, stigma, and a lack of support and accommodations at school that make it impossible for many to juggle schooling and childcare responsibilities,” said Elin Martinez, senior children’s rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. “These combined barriers means that many, if not most, pregnant or parenting girls drop out of school without completing their basic education.”

In 2003, the Mozambican government adopted a ministerial order that mandated school officials to move pregnant girls and adolescent mothers from daytime schools to night-shift schools, building on an existing infrastructure used for adult basic education. This order effectively authorized and cemented discrimination against these students in the national education system, denying pregnant or parenting female students the right to study in primary and secondary schools along with their peers.

Civil society groups in Mozambique led a campaign that successfully pressed the education ministry to revoke the order, remove discriminatory barriers against girls who are pregnant or parents, and protect girls from widespread sexual violence in schools. In December 2018, the government revoked the 2003 order and instructed schools to enable pregnant and parenting students to study during the regular school day.

Through the removal of its discriminatory policy, the government has shown political will to advance girls’ education, Human Rights Watch said. However, it has struggled to turn this positive policy into reality at the school level and to tackle the enormous systemic and social barriers girls face to stay in school. Human Rights Watch found that some teachers and school authorities automatically referred students to night-shift schools due to stigma, existing discriminatory practices, or unclear or no guidance from officials. Other teachers did support or encourage female students to stay in schools.

Pregnant and parenting girls, like many secondary school students in Mozambique, also drop out of school because of the lack of free education, as well as other systemic and financial barriers that disproportionately affect girls from the poorest households. These include the high cost of education linked to tuition and enrollment fees, payments for school uniforms and other indirect costs, and the often long and sometimes unsafe distances to schools or the cost of transportation.

Childcare responsibilities also make it impossible for many young mothers to go to school. The government should ensure that students are supported and encouraged to stay in school by setting up childcare and early childhood education facilities that are easily accessible to parenting students.

The Mozambican government should adopt legally enforceable regulations to ensure girls’ right to education during pregnancy and parenthood, Human Rights Watch said. The government should give due consideration to the experiences and views of adolescent girls and women and learn from other African countries’ experiences, to define its own human rights-compliant policy framework to successfully address pregnant and parenting adolescents’ needs.

The government should also ensure that all children have access to scientifically accurate, age- and stage-appropriate comprehensive sexuality education and free and robust adolescent-responsive reproductive health services, including access to abortion to the fullest extent allowed by the law.

“Mozambique’s government faces enormous challenges in advancing adolescent girls’ right to education,” Martinez said. “The Ministry of Education and Human Development should send a strong signal of its commitment to gender equality by swiftly adopting ministerial instructions to ensure that all schools and teachers understand their obligations.”

(New York) – Pakistani authorities should ensure the peaceful transfer of power following national parliamentary elections on February 8, 2024, Human Rights Watch said today. The Election Commission of Pakistan should promptly announce the official results, and all political parties and stakeholders should commit to upholding democratic norms and cooperating with an independent investigation into alleged election irregularities.

The elections were marred by the authorities’ widespread clampdown on freedom of expression and association. The mass detention and harassment of supporters of the Pakistan Tehrik-i-Insaf (PTI) party, including a ban on the use of its election symbol, undermined a fair vote and prevented a level playing field for all candidates. The authorities further harmed the credibility of the electoral process by shutting down cell phone signals on election day and delaying the announcement of election results. Several candidates have alleged vote rigging in some locations.

“The Pakistani government should respect the election results and ensure a peaceful transfer of power,” said Patricia Gossman, associate Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Pakistan’s deepening human rights and economic crises highlight the need for a representative government that will promote respect for fundamental rights and freedoms.”

No party achieved a simple majority of the February 8 vote. Instead, the results have been split among the three major political parties: PTI, Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N), and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). Until there is an accepted resolution, the current impasse could lead to protests. The Pakistani authorities should uphold the right to peaceful assembly while responding to acts of violence with the minimum force necessary.

International observers including the European Union, United States, and United Kingdom have expressed concern about the fundamental fairness of the elections for all political parties and called for an investigation into claims of election irregularities.

Before the elections, a government crackdown on opposition parties, primarily the PTI, the party of imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan, as well as other opposition parties, has resulted in hundreds of detentions – some on charges of violence. Journalists described intimidation, harassment, and surveillance by the authorities for perceived criticism of the government. Some politicians and journalists have been charged under Pakistan's vague and overly broad sedition law, based on colonial-era legislation, and dozens have been tried in military courts in violation of international law.

Pakistan has had a history of elections that raised serious concerns as to whether they were free and fair. Similar election irregularities marred the 2018 and 2013 elections.

The policy of successive Pakistan governments of clamping down on critical voices in the media, nongovernmental organizations, and the political opposition has eroded the infrastructure for upholding human rights and democratic governance. Structural denial of rights, such as requirements for computerized identification cards, has practically disenfranchised marginalized groups, including in this election, Human Rights Watch said.

Pakistan has been undergoing one of the worst economic crises in its history, jeopardizing millions of people’s rights to health, food, and an adequate standard of living. These human rights challenges will need to be addressed by a government that has legitimacy both at home and abroad, Human Rights Watch said. Among the human rights challenges facing the country, the incoming parliament should adopt electoral reforms to remove structural barriers to political participation and guard against improper interference in the electoral process.

“The Pakistani government’s repeated crackdowns on free expression and association in the political process have hurt the credibility of the country’s elections,” Gossman said. “Real reform of the democratic political process is needed to put an end to the political manipulation of elections.”",HIGH,20240212T224500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Patricia Gossman, Imran Khan",Pakistani authorities,Pakistan,Adopt electoral reforms to remove barriers to political participation,Widespread clampdown on freedom of expression and association during elections,Pakistan,"Government crackdown on opposition and media, structural denial of rights"

The Emirates Detainees Advocacy Center (EDAC), the Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR), Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch urgently appeal to United Nations special procedures, UN Member States, and the European Union to call on the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to drop recent abusive terrorism charges against at least 84 Emiratis. The defendants include many prisoners previously tried in the mass trial in 2012 to 2013, the UAE94 case, of whom the majority are now arbitrarily detained past the end of their sentences including GCHR’s Board member Ahmed Mansoor and academic Dr. Nasser Bin Ghaith, as well as others in exile. The case is all the more shocking given that the first hearing began while the UAE was hosting the 28th Conference of Parties (COP28) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

None of the accused are alleged to have committed any new crimes, but are now on trial in connection with charges related to membership in a group for which they have already been tried. According to the Emirates Detainees Advocacy Center (EDAC), authorities charged 43 of the men with establishing a “terrorist organization” and at least 41 with supporting and funding a “terrorist organization,” charges that carry sentences of up to life imprisonment or the death penalty.

On January 6, 2024, the state news agency officially announced the trial and the new charges against the 84 defendants – a month after the first hearing took place – stating that the defendants concealed evidence of the crime of “establishing another clandestine organization for the purpose of committing acts of violence and terrorism” on state territory.

The first hearing was held on December 7, 2023 at the Abu Dhabi Federal Appeal Court. Authorities appointed state attorneys to those whose families had not hired defense lawyers. Defense lawyers were unable to meet with their defendants before the trial, and were thus not able to properly prepare a defense. During the first four trial hearings in this case, authorities reportedly placed the families in a separate room to observe the proceedings on a screen with defective sound; and at the second hearing on December 14, 2023, the sound was cut off, preventing the families from following the proceedings. In addition, some families have not been able to attend the hearings as the authorities have refused to renew their IDs.

The latest hearing was on February 7, 2024 to hear the prosecution’s arguments, which refuted claims that the defendants had already been tried for the same charge in 2012 to 2013.

For the first time, EDAC reports that families of the detainees were allowed to follow the court’s proceeding from inside the courtroom. The detainees were leg-shackled throughout the trial session, which lasted from 10:00 in the morning until 3:00 in the afternoon. They requested that the next session of the trial, scheduled for February, 8, 2024, be postponed due to the arduous length of the hearing and the time needed to transport the defendants to and from prison. The next hearing date has yet to be made clear.

Of the at least 84 defendants, 43 are charged with establishing a terrorist organisation and another 41 are charged with supporting and financing it. Ahmed Mansoor, who was arrested on March 20, 2017, and sentenced to 10 years in prison in May 2018, and Dr. Nasser Bin Ghaith, who was sentenced on March 29, 2017, to ten years in prison, are among those accused of supporting this “terrorist” organization.

Should the defendants be convicted, their appeal could go to the highest court, the Federal Supreme Court.

Although the authorities have not made public any documents relating to the case, it is likely that the defendants are being charged pursuant to Federal Law No. 7 of 2014 on Combating Terrorist Offences, which imposes the death penalty or life imprisonment for establishing or heading a terrorist organization and defines terrorism in vague and overly broad terms that can extend to “doing harm to property or the environment, harming the internal or external security of society, hostility to the state, or affecting the state’s public authorities … in the conduct of their work.”

Among the 84 people who have been falsely charged with terrorism are at least three exiled Emiratis who had previously been put on a terrorism list, including Hamad Al-Shamsi, Executive Director of EDAC, and Ahmed Al-Shaibah Al-Nuaimi.

In August 2023, GCHR, EDAC, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and 19 other NGOs issued a joint appeal calling for the release of all detained human rights defenders and activists, including over 60 who had completed their sentences, ahead of COP28 in the UAE.

The majority of the defendants in the current trial who are being held beyond their completed sentences are from the UAE94 mass trial. They include human rights lawyers Dr. Mohammed Al-Roken and Dr. Mohammed Al-Mansoori and dozens of others who were arrested after signing a 2011 reform petition.

On January 19, 2024, 17 UN Experts issued a statement expressing grave concern that the trial of “84 members of civil society on spurious terrorism charges could result in the death penalty or lengthy prison sentences.”

Despite repeated calls by human rights organizations and international mechanisms over the past years, the UAE authorities have not allowed international experts or independent monitors access to Ahmed Mansoor or other human rights defenders in prison. Since July 2023, the authorities have held at least 11 UAE94 defendants in incommunicado detention, and at least one has told the court that he has been held in solitary confinement for a year and half, according to EDAC. Others also complained of being held in solitary confinement and one defendant complained of being beaten daily, leading some to declare they would go on hunger strike to protest their prison conditions. Visits by independent observers would, at least, provide verification of the prisoners’ situation and, pending their release, could lead to improving their prison conditions.

(Beirut) – The Houthis say they have recruited thousands of people to their armed forces since October 7, 2023, and activists report the armed group recruiting children as young as 13, Human Rights Watch said today. Recruiting children younger than 15 is a war crime.

On October 10, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, the leader of the Houthi movement, also known as Ansar Allah, made a speech in which he called for people to be ready to defend Palestine, in response to the atrocities carried out during the hostilities between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups in Gaza since October 7. Though the Houthis have systematically recruited children in Yemen since at least 2009, child recruitment by the Houthis has increased noticeably in the last few months amid the hostilities in Gaza, activists said.

“The Houthis are exploiting the Palestinian cause to recruit more children for their domestic fight in Yemen,” said Niku Jafarnia, Yemen and Bahrain researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The Houthis should be investing resources into providing the basic needs of children in their territories like good education, food, and water, rather than replacing their childhood with conflict.”

Human Rights Watch spoke with five human rights activists and individuals working with civil society organizations across Yemen, who confirmed a significant increase in child recruitment in recent months.

One woman who leads a human rights-focused nongovernmental organization said: “The Houthis make children believe that they will fight to liberate Palestine, but they end up sending them to [the front lines in] Marib and Taizz. Indeed, the Houthis’ Gaza is Marib [a Yemeni city with oil resources Houthis have repeatedly attacked].” The Houthis have also unlawfully besieged the northeastern city of Taizz since 2015, in which they have blocked water and humanitarian aid from reaching civilians.

On November 16, during a graduation ceremony for the first group of military recruits since October 7, the Houthis announced that they would form new military brigades to carry out al-Houthi's October 10 directive.

A member of the Houthis’ political office, Houtham Assad, told various media outlets: “As for the general mobilization in support of our people in the Gaza Strip ... training camps were opened, tens of thousands of young people volunteered to study military craft, [and] several groups have already graduated in various provinces of Yemen.”

Over the last three months, the Houthis have recruited more than 70,000 new fighters, they have said, including from the governorates of Dhamar, Sanaa, Saada, Ammran, Hajja, and Hodeida.

While it is unclear how many of the new recruits have been children, several activists and experts working on issues related to child recruitment told Human Rights Watch that the vast majority of recruits are ages 13 to 25, including at least hundreds or thousands who are younger than 18. News releases about their recent recruitment published by the Houthis’ official news outlet, SabaNet, show people who appear to be children.

The Houthis have recruited thousands of children since the start of the conflict in Yemen in 2014. The United Nations has verified at least 1,851 individual cases of child recruitment or use by the Houthis since 2010. According to Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor and SAM Organization for Rights and Liberties, a Yemeni civil society organization, the Houthis recruited over 10,000 children between 2014 and 2021. The Yemeni government has also recruited children throughout the conflict despite an action plan to end child recruitment that they signed with the UN in 2014.

The UN secretary-general has included the Houthis in his annual list of groups responsible for grave violations against children in armed conflict every year since 2011. He initially listed the Houthis for their recruitment and use of child soldiers, and since 2016 has also listed them for killing and maiming children and for attacks against schools and hospitals.

In 2022, the Houthis signed an action plan with the UN to end grave violations against children, including the recruitment and use of children in their forces, and committed to releasing all children from their forces within six months.

Tawfik al-Hamidi, the president of SAM, told Human Rights Watch that the Houthis use their government institutions in their efforts to recruit children, including the Ministries of Education, Interior, and Defense. “All of them are working together and coordinate to mobilize children and recruit them,” he said.

Another activist, who works as a human rights researcher, said that “[recruitment] activities in schools have increased massively [since October 7], including through the school scouts. They take students from schools to their culture centers where they lecture children about the Jihad and send them to military camps and front lines.”

By leveraging official institutions, including schools, the Houthis have managed to take advantage of a far broader swathe of children. The UN secretary-general has also reported on the Houthis’ use of educational facilities for military purposes.

Human Rights Watch has also documented the Houthis’ use of much-needed humanitarian assistance to recruit men and children to their forces. At least 21.6 million people in Yemen, about two-thirds of the population, need some form of humanitarian assistance, and 80 percent of the country struggles to put food on the table and access basic services, according to the UN Population Fund.

“While the main reason for families to send their children is their position supporting the Palestinian cause, Houthis offer salaries and food baskets for families of those who are willing to join them, which works well given the deteriorated humanitarian and economic situation,” said a female human rights activist in Sanaa.

Another woman who works on issues related to child recruitment in Yemen said that the Houthis had recently given food baskets to each soldier’s family in her village. In their 2023 report, the UN Panel of Experts on Yemen also documented this distribution of food baskets.

The Houthis impose unnecessary restrictions and regulations on the delivery and distribution of humanitarian assistance, which has amounted to the obstruction of humanitarian aid. They have also blocked aid from entering Taizz city, which they have held under siege since 2015, and have restricted women’s movement, which has prevented many humanitarian aid workers from carrying out their work.

The ongoing US and UK-led airstrikes on Yemen have reportedly increased domestic support for the Houthis, strengthening the Houthis’ ability to recruit children. Maysaa Shujaa Aldeen, a researcher at the Sana'a Center For Strategic Studies, told the Washington Post that the “Houthis are connecting their attacks in the Red Sea to support [for] Gaza, which is a moral pretext for most people in the MENA region. These attacks have increased their ability to recruit, especially in the northern tribal areas.”

In 2023, the Panel of Experts also reported that “most violations [of child recruitment] investigated by the Panel were attributed to the Houthis, who continue to recruit and use children, particularly in the context of the summer camps.”

The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, which Yemen ratified in March 2007, states that non-state armed groups may not, under any circumstances, recruit people under 18 or use them in hostilities.

“The future of Yemen depends on its children,” Jafarnia said. “The Houthis are demonstrating that the only future they see for the country is one in which everyone’s purpose is to fight for their cause.”",HIGH,20240213T054500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Abdul Malik al-Houthi, Niku Jafarnia, Tawfik al-Hamidi, Maysaa Shujaa Aldeen",Houthis,"Marib, Taizz, and other regions in Yemen","International intervention, enforcement of child protection laws, provision of humanitarian aid",Recruiting children to armed forces,Yemen,"Ongoing conflict in Yemen, exploitation of the Palestinian cause, economic hardship"

Last May, a large fire engulfed the La Esperanza gold mine in southern Peru, trapping workers underground. The blaze, the cause of which has yet to be definitively proven, tragically killed 27 workers. The mine had received certification from the Responsible Jewellery Council (RJC), an industry body which requires companies to demonstrate safeguards in order to meet its certification standards.

A recent study by a Swiss civil society coalition shows the deaths were not only tragic, but potentially avoidable. Its research uncovered a previously unpublished investigation by the Peruvian authorities that revealed the mine lacked basic safety rules and procedures for fire prevention. This is despite workers having complained about poor safety standards prior to the disaster.

Given the existence of this report, is all the more bewildering that the mine was certified as “responsible” by the RJC. To meet its certification standard, companies must abide by its Code of Practices, which requires them to have robust safety precautions, including fire safety equipment and alarms, and to provide training on fire safety and emergency procedures. Asked about its response to the fire, the RJC told Human Rights Watch that La Esperanza mine was suspended in January 2024, pending an internal investigation.

Previous research by Human Rights Watch found that the Code of Practices does not require robust on-the-ground human rights assessments from companies, and that the certification process is opaque. For example, audit reports used to assess whether a company meets the Code’s requirements are not published, nor are the details of any violations. The RJC only publishes a summary.

Certification schemes have proliferated in recent decades across sectors and many have serious flaws. Audits are often superficial and not designed to detect problems, and are often conducted remotely. In the case of La Esperanza mine, the last audit before the blaze was a desktop review, conducted in March 2023, two months before the fire.

It doesn’t have to be this way. Governments, including Switzerland, where the gold was imported, should pass robust laws that require companies to conduct human rights and environmental due diligence in their supply chains, including on fire safety.

Sri Lanka is still reeling from an economic crisis largely caused by misgovernance and lack of accountability. Public protests in 2022 forced the president and the prime minister, brothers Gotabaya and Mahinda Rajapaksa, to step down.

But instead of focusing on social justice and rights, the new government, led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, is focused on suppressing dissent and limiting international attention on human rights.

Although it is the Rajapaksas that nominated – and are propping up – their successor, many foreign observers, including in India and the United States, had hoped that things would change.

Wickremesinghe, who had previously politically opposed the Rajapaksa-led party, was expected to reverse the authoritarian policies of the previous government, address entrenched corruption, stabilise the economy and even comply with international pledges to bring long-awaited justice for violations during the 1987-’89 insurgency in the south, and the 1983-2009 civil war in the north.

Instead, Wickremesinghe has moved forcefully to stifle criticism with a raft of new, repressive laws as the country prepares to hold a presidential election later this year. The Online Safety Act, adopted by parliament in January, creates vague and broad speech-related offenses punishable with lengthy prison terms.

The Anti-Terrorism Bill currently before parliament contains draconian powers, while the government continues to use the notorious Prevention of Terrorism Act to violate fundamental due process rights. A draft law to regulate non-governmental organisations, circulated by the government in January, could make it impossible for civil society organizations to function freely.

Back in 2015, when Wickremasinghe was the prime minister, he backed a consensus resolution at the United Nations Human Rights Council, committing to 25 key undertakings across a range of human rights issues, mostly related to the 1983-2009 civil war.

That government also pledged to provide answers to families of the “disappeared”, and to provide reparations for victims of abuses.

But there was little progress, and his government lost the next elections. Soon after Gotabaya Rajapaksa became president in 2019, he withdrew from the resolution, appointing officials implicated in war crimes and serious rights abuses to politically powerful and senior official positions. Numerous mass graves, in most cases discovered accidentally, have not been properly examined to identify the victims or their killers.

The UN Human Rights Council in a 2021 resolution established the Sri Lanka Accountability Project to gather evidence of international crimes for use in future prosecutions. With the resolution due for renewal in September 2024, Wickremesinghe, this time, is hoping to persuade the council to end its scrutiny of Sri Lanka.

But the government’s actions expose the need for continued international attention. Even as it has announced the Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation in Sri Lanka Bill, purportedly to address civil war atrocities, the authorities continue to silence and repress the families of the disappeared.

Successive Sri Lankan governments have appointed at least 10 commissions since the 1990s to examine human rights violations and war crimes. The new law simply replicates previous failed efforts, ignores the needs of victims, and falls far short of meeting Sri Lanka’s international legal obligations.

Many victims say they have “commission fatigue”, and see no use in providing their testimony again, risking re-traumatisation and possible threats from security forces.

The government needs to urgently reverse course to meet its human rights obligations. That should include repealing or reforming the Online Safety Act to protect the rights to free expression and privacy; amending the Anti-Terrorism Bill to meet international human rights standards; imposing a moratorium on the use of the Prevention of Terrorism Act until it is repealed; and dropping the draft non-governmental organisations law, or any bill that constrains civil society.

The Wickremesinghe administration should work to correct the authoritarian legacy of its predecessors by safeguarding freedom of expression and letting civil society groups operate freely, particularly in the north and east.

It should stop arresting Tamil community members for the memorialisation of their war dead, and end government actions to appropriate Tamil and Muslim lands, including religious sites, in the north and east.

Sri Lankans are grappling with declining economic and social conditions, amid impunity for decades of human rights violations and for official corruption.

According to the United Nations World Food Programme, in 2023 more than 17% of the population was moderately or acutely food insecure and in need of humanitarian assistance, and 31% of children under 5 were malnourished. From 2021 to 2022, the country’s poverty rate doubled, to 25% and is projected to rise further.

In March 2023, a loan from the International Monetary Fund paved the way for multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank to offer new financing.

The International Monetary Fund programme focused on raising government revenues and emphasised tackling corruption and improving social protection. However, as structured, the program has shifted the burden of recovery principally onto people with low incomes, undermining people’s economic and social rights.

Since the founding of the Blue Diamond Society in 2001 and a groundbreaking victory for fundamental rights at the Supreme Court in 2007, Nepal has been recognized globally for advances for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights. A significant focus of Nepali civil society organizing and legal advocacy has been human rights violations against transgender people, and the fight for trans people’s recognition before the law. Activists have used creative strategies that draw on local cultures and international frameworks to gain a foothold in the Nepali legal system and in society.

While early gains, such as Nepal’s pioneering recognition of a third gender category based on self-identification, have garnered widespread praise and made Nepal an important touchpoint for LGBT rights movements elsewhere, implementation remains piecemeal and inadequate. There is no explicit legal option in Nepal to change one’s gender marker to “male” or “female,” and even the procedure for the third (or “other”) gender option is unclear and ad hoc. In addition, as this report shows, interactions between transgender people and the state have become particularly fraught with discriminatory, ill-informed, and harmful medicalized practices.

Following the resounding victory at the Supreme Court in 2007, activists used the judgment to push government agencies to respect their rights. Much of this came about through advocacy for administrative recognition of the third gender category on official documents and in data sets. There was significant progress in this regard, including the recognition of the third gender category in the national census, on citizenship cards, and on passports, among other advances.

But each gain was also met with challenges. The definition of who was included in the third gender category differed across systems and lacked clarity. And when it came to perhaps the most important instance of the state’s recognition of legal gender—the nagarikta or citizenship card—the government ordered local administrative offices to implement it without providing a clear procedure. As a result, a haphazard and para-official process for transgender people to change their legal gender has emerged. This process has no official basis in policy, but rather is carried out according to stereotypes and assumptions by bureaucrats, physicians, and other people in positions of power.

Some people have been able to obtain documents reading “third gender” or “other”; others have been denied entirely, or wrongly told they must have surgery to be eligible. A small number of people have been able to change their documents from “male” to “female,” but doing so invariably involves an invasive and humiliating physical exam in a medical setting. As documented in this report, the process for obtaining legal gender recognition contains troubling elements of medicalization and inappropriate bureaucratic scrutiny of physical characteristics as markers of gender identity; trans people’s experiences of the ad hoc process reveal it is too often confusing, slow, and rife with human rights violations.

International human rights law and medical best practices support the complete separation of medical and legal processes with regard to gender transition. In other words, individuals attempting to access transition-related medical interventions should not face legal barriers, and people attempting to change their legal gender and name should not be required to undergo any medical procedures. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH)—an international, multidisciplinary professional association composed of more than 700 members worldwide—“opposes all medical requirements that act as barriers to those wishing to change legal sex or gender markers on documents.” The organization stated that “[m]edical and other barriers to gender recognition for transgender individuals may harm physical and mental health.”

The Supreme Court has been an important venue for advancing the rights of transgender people in Nepal. The Court in Pant v. Nepal (2007) and subsequent cases, including Pant v. Nepal (2017), made significant strides in recognizing the rights of transgender people. Nonetheless, as illustrated by Kapali v. Nepal, a case before the court at time of writing, implementation of the court's decisions has been uneven and fraught with missteps, and the process for obtaining and updating identity documents is in urgent need of clarification and revision. In Rukshana Kapali’s petition to the court, she is asking that the principle of self-identification (or as the court said, “self-feeling”) expressed in Pant v. Nepal (2007) in relation to a third gender category also now be applied to transgender people who want to change their documents to a binary male or female legal gender.

In 2007 when the court issued its first judgment on LGBT rights, it ordered the government to take three steps: audit all laws and scrap those that discriminated against LGBT people; form a committee to study same-sex marriage legislation; and legally recognize a “third gender” category based on an individual’s own self-identification. The judgment in Pant v. Nepal (2007) has been cited by courts around the world, including the Supreme Court of India, courts in the United States considering third gender passports, and the European Court of Human Rights, as a positive example. However Nepali authorities continue to lag in implementing the court’s order to recognize gender identity on the basis of self-identification.

The court’s emphasis on self-identification has echoed through subsequent judgments, which are discussed in this report. In practice, however, trans people in Nepal have met significant barriers when attempting to change their legal gender according to their identity. These barriers include instructions to undergo surgeries that are not available in-country, invasive medical exams to confirm the appearance of their genitals and breasts, and other forms of humiliation and violations of their privacy by government officials.

The principle of self-feeling should be consistently applied, and its application should not allow medical practitioners or bureaucrats to confirm or deny an applicant’s self-declared gender identity. The lack of a clear procedure for self-declaration of gender identity has led to decisions based on the prevailing perceptions among officials rather than the “self-feeling” of the individual concerned. As the accounts in this report demonstrate, trans people who approach different administrative offices are given different advice and instructions, which sometimes contradicts what their peers are told while undertaking the same process elsewhere. One trans woman interviewed for this report said: “The state just throwing in medical steps is a way they think they’re stabilizing something that was confusing, whereas we experience it as yet another barrier and yet another way in which we have to beg for our rights.”

Legal gender recognition is an essential element of a range of fundamental rights—including the right to privacy, the right to freedom of expression, the right to be free from arbitrary arrest, and rights related to employment, education, health, security, access to justice, and the ability to move freely.

The Yogyakarta Principles—compiled by a group of experts, including Nepali LGBT rights activist and former member of parliament Sunil Babu Pant—state that each person’s self-defined sexual orientation and gender identity is “integral to their personality” and is a basic aspect of identity, personal autonomy, dignity, and freedom. The principles are clear that gender recognition may involve, “if freely chosen, modification of bodily appearance or function by medical, surgical or other means.” Put simply, the process for legal recognition should be separate from any medical interventions. But if an individual’s personal transition process requires medical support, those services should be available and accessible.

Implementing the right to legal gender recognition is important for transgender people to leave behind a life of marginalization and enjoy a life of social equality and dignity. A shift toward allowing people autonomy to determine how their gender is expressed and recorded is gaining momentum. The law should not force people to carry an identity marker that does not reflect who they are. It should also not force transgender people to undergo unwanted medical procedures to be recognized or achieve any of the other associated rights.

The Nepali government should urgently follow the Supreme Court’s judgments and implement a transparent and quick administrative procedure to change their legal gender on citizenship certificates and all other legal documents and registers.

Glossary

A note on terminology:

In English, “transgender” is often used as an inclusive or umbrella term for anyone whose sex assigned to them at birth does not conform to their lived or perceived gender. It refers to people for whom the designation as “female” or “male” on their birth certificate does not align with the gender that they are most comfortable expressing or would express if given a choice. In Nepali, there are several terms that refer to people whose gender identity and expression differ from their sex assigned at birth. This glossary explains them—as widely-recognized English terms—in an attempt to clarify where terms differ or overlap.

Cisgender: The gender identity of people whose sex assigned at birth conforms to their identified or lived gender.

Gender: The social and cultural codes used to distinguish between society’s conceptions of “femininity” and “masculinity.”

Gender Expression: The external characteristics and behaviors that societies define as “feminine,” “androgynous,” or “masculine,” including such attributes as dress, appearance, mannerisms, hairstyle, speech patterns, and social behavior and interactions.

Gender Identity: A person’s internal, deeply felt sense of being female or male, both, or something other than female and male, such as third gender or non-binary.

Gender Non-Conforming: A person who does not conform to stereotypical appearances, behaviors or traits associated with sex assigned at birth.

Intersex: An umbrella term that refers to a range of variations in chromosomes, gonads, and/or genitals that vary from what is considered typical for female or male bodies. A former medical term, “intersex” has been reclaimed by some as a personal and political identity. Intersex is not the same as transgender, which describes individuals whose gender differs from the sex they were assigned or presumed at birth.

Sex: The biological classification of bodies as male or female based on such factors as external sex organs, internal sexual and reproductive organs, hormones, and chromosomes.

Third Gender: A term referring to the gender identity of people who do not identify with male or female gender categories. Third gender categories exist throughout history and across cultures around the world. In Nepal, the term first entered legal and political discourse following the Supreme Court judgment in Pant v. Nepal (2007).

Meti: A term that is believed to have originated in Darjeeling, India, which refers to people assigned male at birth who develop a more feminine gender identity. It has sometimes been used in reference to people who identify as transgender women or third gender.

Hijra: An identity category for people assigned male at birth who develop a feminine gender identity, which has long been recognized culturally, if not legally. Hijras’ traditional status, which included bestowing blessings at weddings, had provided some protection and a veneer of respect. But rather than being viewed as equal to others before the law, they were regarded as marginal.

Transgender: The gender identity of people whose sex assigned at birth does not conform to their identified or lived gender. A transgender person usually adopts, or would prefer to adopt, a gender expression in consonance with their gender identity but may or may not desire to alter their physical characteristics to conform to their gender identity.

Transgender Men: Persons designated female at birth but who identify and may present themselves as men. Transgender men are referred to with male pronouns.

Transgender Women: Persons designated male at birth but who identify and may present themselves as women. Transgender women are referred to with female pronouns.

Recommendations

To the Ministry of Home Affairs

Consistently oppose the introduction of “medical proof” clauses in drafts laws and policies related to citizenship.

Issue a clarifying directive, in line with international human rights law and global medical best practices, that no medical proof should be required for Nepalis to change their legal gender.

Work with civil society groups to create a transparent and quick procedure for processing paperwork related to legal gender change, which would end extreme delays, as an interim measure while appropriate and rights-respecting legal gender recognition policy is created.

To Members of Parliament

Develop a law, with the input of civil society groups, that enables transgender people to be recognized according to their self-defined gender identity and to change their legal name and gender without any medical requirements.

Ensure that transgender children are not excluded from the possibility of applying for legal recognition of their gender identity, in recognition of the fact that it may be in the best interests of some transgender children to change their legal gender before the age of majority.

Design the relevant procedures in line with Nepal’s obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child to acknowledge that, as children grow and acquire capacities, they are entitled to an increasing level of responsibility for and say in the regulation of matters affecting them.

To the Ministry of Health

Update all healthcare policies that affect transgender people so they align with the World Professional Association of Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care-8, which were set by international health and medical experts for healthcare systems to provide the best possible care for transgender people.

Publicly support the creation of procedures through which transgender people in Nepal can change their legal gender on the basis of their own self-declared identity. The ministry should clarify that according to international health and human rights standards, medical evidence is not required for legal gender recognition.

Ensure that transgender people have access to the medical and psychological assistance and support they need, regardless of whether they pursue medical steps or a legal gender change, and that such assistance and support is affordable and available within a reasonable time.

Ensure, in consultation with transgender people and civil society groups, that health insurance schemes cover all medical interventions related to gender transition.

Provide training to health service professionals, including psychologists, psychiatrists, general practitioners, and social workers, regarding the specific needs and rights of transgender persons and the legal and ethical requirements to respect their dignity.

Conduct a rigorous and independent investigation into human rights abuses in the ad hoc legal gender recognition process in various parts of the country, including violations that take place in medical settings such as Bir Hospital.

To the Nepal Medical Council and Nepal Medical Board

Work with WPATH to adopt the WPATH Standards of Care as the Nepal Medical Council’s care standards, and train providers on these standards.

Undertake consultations with transgender community leaders and endocrinology experts to discuss and understand how to provide hormone therapy to transgender people in a manner that supports their access to desired therapies and to ensure safe and effective monitoring of these medications.

To the National Human Rights Commission

Working with civil society groups, the National Human Rights Commission should launch a rigorous and independent investigation into human rights abuses in the ad hoc legal gender recognition process in various parts of the country, including violations that take place in medical settings such as Bir Hospital.

Methodology

Human Rights Watch conducted the research for this report between August and December 2022. A researcher interviewed 18 transgender people who had attempted to change their legal gender or had not undertaken the process due to various barriers, as well as activists who help others undertake the legal gender recognition process. In addition, the researcher accompanied a trans woman during her “medical verification” visit in a hospital in Kathmandu, at her request and after a thorough discussion about comfort and security considerations with her and another activist accompanying her for the procedure.

Interviews were conducted in English and Nepali, with an interpreter when necessary. All interviews had the full informed consent of participants who were informed that they could stop the interview at any time or decline to answer any questions they did not feel comfortable answering. All interviews were conducted in private, except for one group interview with interviewees who had indicated they preferred to speak in this manner. Most of the names in the report are pseudonyms, unless interviewees explicitly asked Human Rights Watch to use their real names because they are already well-known and their experience was shaped in part by their public profile.

Human Rights Watch reimbursed transportation costs of interviewees who traveled to meet researchers in safe locations outside their homes or offices. No compensation was paid to any interviewees.

Human Rights Watch wrote to the Ministry of Health and Population, and the Ministry of Home Affairs regarding the findings in this report, in May 2023. The letters are included as appendices to this report. At the time of publication, we had not received a response.

Background: Nepal’s LGBTI Rights History

In a 2009 report about LGBT rights movements globally, Human Rights Watch wrote that Nepal’s early successes were inspiring activists across South Asia. It lauded the tenacity, creativity, and effectiveness of the first eight years of organized Nepali LGBT rights activism:

Nepal’s leading LGBT group negotiated the thickets of HIV/AIDS funding, found its own path from service provision to political advocacy, and changed the country. ‘We started with health intervention,’ they recount, which was ‘a way to reach out to the larger society in a non-threatening manner.’ With the information collected through outreach they began documenting and publicizing human rights abuses, ‘letting the world know what kinds of violations sexual and gender minorities faced.’ Political interventions grew out of that, as they ‘took to the streets, began to lobby political parties, and even participated in elections,’ as well as ‘took the government to court.’ They persuaded the country’s Supreme Court to mandate protections in law for sexual orientation and gender identity—and the group’s founder [from 2008 to 2012] served in parliament.

In celebrating the successes of LGBT rights activists in Nepal, Human Rights Watch joined dozens of other global institutions in holding the country up as a success story. However, legal progress has stalled. Astraea Foundation, a global donor organization, cautioned in a 2022 report that “Nepal cannot rest on praise from the international community promoting it as a bastion of progress on LGBTQI+ rights.” Continued advancement of LGBT rights remains crucial, however, as the Prevention Collaborative and UN Women-Nepal explained in 2020: “Translating the Supreme Court rulings into a legal framework that guarantees inclusion and protections is slow-paced and hindered mainly by bureaucracy and dominant patriarchal institutional and social culture.” Legal scholar Mara Malagodi observed in a 2023 paper: “Legal reforms towards greater gender inclusion are often resisted by [Nepali] state authorities in the name of protecting the nation’s autochthonous social values and religious traditions to legitimize patriarchal and heteronormative forms of exclusion.”

Among other unrealized promises, Nepal lacks a comprehensive and rights-based procedure for transgender people to change their legal gender. A third gender, or “other,” category is available to trans persons, but in some cases applicants for the third gender category are requested to provide medical evidence of transition. There is no explicit legal option to change gender markers to “male” or “female” without undergoing a full surgical transition, and even then, the administrative procedure is unclear and ad hoc.



In addition, as this report shows, interfaces between transgender people and the state have become particularly fraught with discriminatory, ill-informed, and harmful medical practices. The history of gender and sexuality activism—as well as legal progress and regress—in Nepal sheds light on the potential for further change and underlines the actions the government should undertake to fulfill its international human rights obligations. As Bhumika Shrestha, a leading trans advocate in Nepal, said: “After 20 years of LGBTI rights advocacy in Nepal, we are just spreading our wings now—we have really just started.”

Claiming Space for LGBT Rights Groups

In the 1990s, some queer people held informal discussion groups about sexuality in Kathmandu, but their efforts were unfunded and ultimately ephemeral in terms of organizing. It was not until 2001 that human rights activism focusing on sexual orientation and gender identity began in earnest in Nepal with the founding of the Blue Diamond Society (BDS). According to Sunil Pant, BDS’s founder, “The clerk at the office looked at the papers and said he could only register the organization if its goal was to convert people back to heterosexuality.” Because of this BDS was registered as a “sexual health” nongovernmental organization (NGO).

At the time, the country was embroiled in an increasingly violent civil war, which began in 1996, and Kathmandu was frequently under curfew. For sexual and gender minorities, including gay and trans sex workers, this meant increased policing of public spaces where they typically gathered. In 2005 and 2006, Human Rights Watch documented repeated attacks on trans and queer people by security forces, calling the pattern a “sexual cleansing drive.”

BDS came into existence a decade after the 1990 reinstallation of multi-party democracy, which had increased space for civil society and introduced a constitution that would become a battleground for minority rights. And it gained its foothold in a rapidly changing civil society sector, influenced by changes in donor priorities in the 1990s and the international apparatus responding to the civil war.

The decade saw international donors shift away from supporting the government’s work on social services and poverty alleviation to supporting NGOs that took up the mantle. Like elsewhere, Nepal received an influx of HIV/AIDS funding. While there were 114 known cases of HIV in Nepal in 1992, the American Foundation for AIDS Research, a major donor, received applications from more than 80 Nepali NGOs that wanted to work on AIDS. Anthropologist Stacey Pigg wrote: “Attention to AIDS therefore [came] to mean, in a very practical sense, an attention to the sexual activities and sexual consciousness of Nepalis in the name of disease prevention.”

Judicial Victories for LGBT Rights

As BDS and its HIV-related activities grew, its formal status as an NGO coupled with public visibility provoked legal challenges and opportunities. On June 18, 2004, a private lawyer petitioned the Supreme Court to shut down BDS. The petition accused the group of trying to “make homosexual activities legal” and demanded it be banned because the lawyer claimed that same-sex conduct was criminalized in Nepal under a vague provision in the law. However, the Supreme Court registrar rejected this claim and the petition because:

From a study of relevant legislation and documents, in relation to the registration of this petition, it did not seem that the sexual activities conducted by adult homosexual persons, in private or personal locations, could become a subject for criminal law. Against Nepal’s current legal scenario, the issue raised by the petition is not found to be a matter of public concern....

But the lawyer refiled the petition immediately, arguing that Nepal’s National Code (the Muluki Ain, which is a combined civil and criminal code re-issued in 1963) did indeed criminalize same-sex conduct.

The Muluki Ain of 1963 referenced aprākṛtik (unnatural) sexual acts and outlaws them, but it does not enumerate those acts. The petitioning lawyer contended that the clause covered same-sex conduct and that BDS’s activities therefore promoted illegal behavior. The court accepted the second petition and asked the government to clarify whether the phrases in the Muluki Ain included same-sex conduct.

The government entities named in the petition responded. The Ministry of Home Affairs denied the petitioner’s argument, saying “there is no clear legal provision to take action against homosexual persons under Number 4 of Bestiality.” The Kathmandu District Administration Office responded with identical language. The cabinet secretary wrote on behalf of the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers: “The writ petition is worthy of annulment.” The Ministry of Law, Justice, and Parliamentary Affairs said that in no way had the ministry or this law violated the petitioner’s rights, so the petition should be dismissed. After several delays and as the country plunged into increased political tumult, including the then-king declaring martial law, the court ultimately refused to entertain the petition in 2006, setting the stage for BDS to return to the court with proactive demands.

In Sunil Babu Pant and others v. Nepal, filed in 2006, LGBT rights activists exercised a new and important tool: the Yogyakarta Principles. These principles—formally the Yogyakarta Principles on the Application of International Human Rights Law in Relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity—had just been published, and one of the co-authors was BDS’s founder, Sunil Babu Pant. The Yogyakarta Principles are an interpretation of International Human Rights Law as it applies to sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and sex characteristics. Sunil Pant and his co-litigants petitioned the Supreme Court to recognize the Yogyakarta Principles in Nepali law.

The case was novel and complex for everyone involved. Advocate Hari Phuyal (now a Supreme Court justice) represented the LGBT groups with advice from two Indian lawyers, Arvind Narrain and Vivek Divan. On the day of the final hearing, the lead justice, Bala Ram KC, asked the chamber if there was anyone who could speak from personal experience about being a sexual or gender minority. A young trans woman, Manisha Dhakal, shared her story, as chronicled in a magazine article:

“I was born male and have a male body and a male name from my family, but that is not how I feel.” She spoke about police abuse and the humiliation of carrying citizenship documents that listed her [sex assigned at birth]. She talked about LGBTI people being harassed at school and dropping out, resulting in [economic marginalization]. “You can see my hair is a little bit long and some of my clothing is for me and some for women,” she said. “This is because my family does not know about my identity. I leave my house in the morning looking like a son, but when I get to the office I wear a shawl and put on a little bit of make-up and I let my hair down like this. This is my reality.”

The court’s final judgment, written by Bala Ram KC in 2007, required the government to legally recognize a third gender category based on the self-identification of the individual, audit all laws to identify those that discriminated against LGBT people, and form a committee to study legal recognition of same-sex relationships.

In response to the court’s order, the government identified more than 100 laws that discriminated against LGBT people. A government-appointed committee then issued a report in early 2015. While it contained some regressive analysis of the nature of the family and sexuality, it effectively recommended the legal recognition of same-sex relationships. But such post-judgment efforts did not gain as much prominence or traction as the court’s order that the government legally recognize a third gender category.

Within weeks of the Court’s ruling, Richard Bennett, the representative of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in Nepal at the time, called the judgment “truly a ground-breaking decision on gender identity and sexual orientation in South Asia and perhaps worldwide.” Courts around the world have referenced the case. For example, courts in the United States and India, as well as the European Court of Human Rights, have cited Pant v. Nepal (2007) in their consideration of comparative law on how to recognize transgender people’s rights.

By 2010, the Election Commission had added the third gender option to voter rolls, and a third gender box was added to immigration forms for tourists soon after. In 2011, Nepal became the first country to include a third gender option on its federal census. In the end, some who wanted to were not allowed to identify as third gender, and because the number of third gender entries was so small the Central Bureau of Statistics processed no data from people who reported as third gender. And in 2015, the government started issuing passports that recognized three genders. That same year, Nepal became the world’s tenth country to specifically protect LGBT people in its constitution. Dhakal, who spoke up that day in court in 2007, became the executive director of BDS in 2015 and is an internationally-recognized human rights campaigner.

Legal scholar Mara Malagodi noted:

In Nepal, the women’s and queer movements have concentrated their efforts first on strategic constitutional litigation anchored in international standards to unhinge deep-seated forms of legal discrimination. They have succeeded in building an impressive body of pro-women and pro-SGDP case law since the early 1990s.

Nepal promulgated a new constitution in September 2015. Article 18 explicitly prohibits discrimination against “gender and sexual minorities,” but this phrase is not defined anywhere in the constitution. Article 42, on the right to social justice, states that “gender and sexual minority groups” have the right to employment in state entities. Article 12 of the 2015 constitution also includes a provision for issuing citizenship documents “by descent on the basis of gender identity.”

Citizenship and Gender in Nepal

Nepal’s constitution guarantees equal rights to men and women and prohibits gender-based discrimination. It also contains provisions that discriminate against women by limiting their ability to confer citizenship to their children. According to Article 11(7) of the constitution, Nepali men can automatically confer citizenship to their children by descent, but Nepali women must prove that her child’s father is Nepali or declare he is “unidentified.” If such a declaration is proven false, the woman would face prosecution. This issue has been embattled through successive governments, in particular around the much-debated Nepal Citizenship Act (Amendment) Bill in recent years.

As significant as the changes to include a third gender category were, the lived experience of trans people in Nepal by and large remains a struggle unsupported by government entities. Definitions of the “third” or “other” gender vary from one ministry or policy to another, and trans people seeking to change their documents have often had their experiences dictated more by the personal preferences and biases of the officials they interacted with than by the letter of the law. Meanwhile, the emphasis of the Supreme Court on the third gender category and related implementation do not accommodate trans people who want to change their gender to “male” or “female”, and not “third” or “other.”

While the Supreme Court has continued to issue judgments that set out procedures for legal gender recognition, the implementation of legal gender recognition for trans people across the country has instead been influenced by contested and confusing definitions, loose accountability, and some high-profile cases in the media.

Over time, authorities began deferring to medicine and medical practitioners to “verify” the sex and gender of trans people even though this process was never explicitly written in policy. Dipeksha M., a trans woman in Kathmandu, described to us why these issues emerged and persist:

Some of the misunderstanding and confusion we’re seeing from officials is the fallout from the early activist emphasis on the third gender category. It opened up space for discussions and rights gains, but it also really cemented that trans people aren’t male or female, and it can be hard to undo that. And so the government, when confused and under pressure, just defaults to medicalization because it’s perceived as neutral and prestigious. And if a doctor says I’m a woman, then the state can just shrug and say it’s not their fault.

This creeping medicalization has created an ad hoc and harmful pathway to legal gender recognition in Nepal. This para-official process where trans people are subjected to the scrutiny of bureaucrats and physicians to “prove” they are transgender is antithetical to the Nepal Supreme Court’s orders, international human rights law, and international medical best practices, which center self-identification; this processneeds urgent reform and regulation. Clarity around definitions and procedures, as well as explicit protections against human rights violations are needed to guide what is already a difficult and fraught process for trans people.

Dipeksha M. attributed the challenges faced by trans people to the lack of governmental accountability and patriarchal systems:

I don’t think the government is actively trying to harm us, but there’s very little accountability in the administrative state. And it’s steeped in patriarchy…. Marginalized people just feel it more because we need these profoundly dysfunctional systems to actually function or we can’t live our lives.

Intersex Rights Advocacy in Nepal In its concluding observations on Nepal in 2016, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child recommended that the government raise awareness about intersex people, ensure intersex children have access to identity documents that allow them to self-declare their gender, regulate the use of medically unnecessary “normalizing” surgeries, and train medical personnel on sexual and gender diversity. In its concluding observations on Nepal in 2018, the CEDAW Committee recommended that Nepal “[a]dopt legislative provisions that explicitly prohibit the performance of unnecessary surgical or other medical procedures on intersex children before they reach the legal age of consent and train medical and psychological professionals on the rights of intersex persons.” These two significant interventions by human rights treaty bodies were largely the result of assiduous advocacy undertaken by Esan Regmi, an intersex person and activist in Nepal whose personal story has received widespread media attention as he attempts to raise awareness about how children born with variations in their sex characteristics are misunderstood and mistreated. When he was 20, Regmi came across LGBTI organizations and information on the internet and began to understand that he had been born with an intersex variation. He had been assigned female at birth; his family, not understanding what was happening with his body as he went through puberty, had sought medical attention in India, but physicians there told them there was no “cure” and to hand him over to hijra communities. “It occurred to me that there may be many others like me in the country who, just like me, had no access to information in their language and stayed hidden in society. I realized that I needed to raise my voice because I did not know anything about intersex until this time,” Regmi said in an interview. In 2017, Regmi registered an NGO called Campaign For Change (CFC), and formalized his activism. Legal gender recognition has been a major focus of CFC’s efforts, as intersex people in Nepal struggle—much like trans people—to change their legal gender on citizenship documents. “Many intersex people are stuck in the middle when it comes to legal documentation. People think we are frauds because our details don’t match our gender identity,” Regmi said. Click to expand Image Bipin Kadayat was born with intersex characteristics.

Creeping Medicalization of Legal Gender Recognition

[The government official told me:] ‘Only a physician can tell us if you are really a sexual and gender minority community member.’

—Raju B. (pseudonym), Kathmandu, December 11, 2022

Having to come out repeatedly and explain and justify yourself to a hospital clerk or administrative staffer in a public setting with dozens of people who could listen in—it’s exhausting and terrifying.

—Dipeksha M. (pseudonym), Kathmandu, December 11, 2022

In recent years, medicalization has been creeping into the para-official processes for trans people in Nepal seeking to change their legal gender to male or female, and also to those seeking documents that identify them as “other” gender. Sarita L., 34-year-old trans woman in Kathmandu, told Human Rights Watch:

There is this unwritten rule these days that if you have done sex reassignment surgery, you can go to the Nepal Medical Board and they will give you a recommendation letter, then you take that to your Chief District Officer and re-apply for citizenship. You have to do so much personal begging and lobbying to make it happen—we have to beg so many people.

The “unwritten rule” Sarita describes above, and which this report documents further, colors the lives of trans people in Nepal today. The fact that gender-affirming surgery—and more specifically genital surgery—could allow a person to change their legal gender to male or female (and not have to choose “other”) appears to have been popularized following a high-profile public transition of Caitlin Pant, the child of a famous comedian. Interviewees attributed the uptick in interest in gender-affirming surgeries over the past decade, as well as the shift in popular understanding of gender identity to a more medicalized concept, to Caitlin Pant’s public transition and acquiring of citizenship documents that identified her as “female” following surgery in Bangkok.

The medical paradigm became quickly embedded, with activists publicly noting as early as 2013 that government officials were demanding letters from doctors for trans people to change their legal gender. By 2019, discussions around amending the citizenship law featured arguments for including a “medical proof” clause for legal gender change in the new law. While the medicalized paradigm is most consistently applied to people seeking binary legal recognition as male or female, Human Rights Watch documented accounts of people seeking third (or “other”) gender legal recognition also being asked by authorities for medical evidence.

Interviewees’ experiences illustrate the gravity and complexity of categories on identity documents, of bureaucratic hurdles and privacy rights violations, and of the impact of the creeping medicalization of legal gender recognition.

For some trans people, including those who had tried multiple times to change their legal gender to “other” in accordance with the 2007 judgment in Pant v. Nepal, the creeping medicalization established an additional hurdle. For others, it created a prohibitive barrier, leaving them in the lurch as their documents undergo years-long processing. And for everyone who was compelled to undergo a medical verification procedure, the new para-official procedure resulted in them being subjected to unnecessary, invasive, and humiliating interventions that violated their rights to privacy, health, and bodily autonomy.

Medicalization of the legal gender recognition process is not the sole barrier, but it is a significant impediment in an already discriminatory system. “Even if you take out the medicalization part of this so-called process, it’s still a horrible, difficult, cumbersome process full of human rights violations,” said Dipeksha M. She continued:

So the state just throwing in medical steps is a way they think they’re stabilizing something that was confusing, whereas we experience it as yet another barrier and yet another way in which we have to beg for our rights.

Bhumika Shrestha, 32, a well-known trans woman activist and politician, explained that she had carried three different gender markers in the past decade: “Male,” “Other,” and “Female.” Her experience with the processes of changing her gender markers and then navigating public spaces, illustrates the need for a transparent and accessible legal gender recognition procedure and a more comprehensive approach to recognizing legal gender across systems.

In 2012, Shrestha went to the District Administration Office (DAO) in Kathmandu to request a change to her legal gender on her nagarikta:

I approached the officer there and asked him to provide me with appropriate ID because I looked like a woman but I still had my nagarikta with a dhaka topi (a hat traditionally worn by some Nepali men, including in official photos) and a male name.

Her request was denied, so in 2015, Shrestha tried again. “The real problem for me is that my nagarikta had my birth name and a male photo. So I put in my request and told them this ID was giving me employment issues,” she said. Bhumika continued:

The DAO officials told me they would change my photo and give me the “other” marker but that it was impossible to change my name. So I did that, then I changed my passport right away. That year, I traveled to Delhi and to Taipei and both places had no problem. In India they ticked “T” [for transgender] based on my “O” documents; in Taiwan they gave me an “X” [for indeterminate] in the gender box. But in Kathmandu, there were problems. At the airport, they couldn’t decide what box to tick for me or which security queue I belonged in—it was humiliating to have them debate this in public. This was just the beginning for me with “O” documents, but it kept going like this—lots of queries everywhere I went, lots of extra waiting for verification because officials looking at my documents had never seen one like this before.

Frustrated, Shrestha decided to approach the DAO again in 2020. “This time, I went with my SRS [sex reassignment surgery] papers and asked for ID that has my name Bhumika on it,” she said. “They told me they’d had a few other people recently come with SRS and ask for gender change and to come back in a month. When I went back, it was a different official, but he told me the same thing, and he said the medical verification process was compulsory.”

The DAO forwarded Shrestha’s request to the Medical Board, and the Board asked her to come for a physical exam. She recounted:

At Bir Hospital, I met with doctors. I showed them my surgery documents; they said it wasn’t enough. They wanted to see my body. It was so humiliating. There was a female nurse with me. They told me this was to prevent abuse from male doctors. I understand that, but the fact that they said it to me like that made me feel even less comfortable. The doctor started feeling around my groin, he said, “to make sure everything is in the right place.” He also told me that if I had a flat chest, he couldn’t consider me a woman.

Shrestha was humiliated. She described her feelings during the experience:

The way the process works with the Medical Board makes us uncomfortable. It was very intimidating to get naked in front of a bunch of strangers. And this is how it is being applied in all the bureaucracy—they send us all to medical exams even though the Home Ministry has endorsed the concept of self-identification.

DAO officials received the Medical Board’s report and summoned Shrestha for a meeting. “They told me they could only change my name from Kailash to Kailashi, but not to Bhumika,” she said. “But I told them that I was too famous under my name [Bhumika]—in politics and on television—for them to give me another fake name. So they gave me Bhumika.” At that time, Shrestha’s main issue with her nagarikta was the male name and photograph, not the gender marker, so she never requested that they change it. However, when she received her new nagarikta three months later, it listed her legal gender as “F.” She accepted it and was happy with the speed with which her case had been resolved, although she attributed it to her status:

I got my new ID in three months; I know people who are still waiting after three years. It just worked out for me because of my public profile—the officials didn’t want to look bad by failing in my case.

Shilpa Chowdhury, a 39-year-old trans woman from Dang district, told Human Rights Watch a similar story. She was happy with her “O” document, but officials said she needed to undergo gender-affirming surgery in order to change her name. When she did the surgery, they changed her name and her legal gender to “F.” Chowdhury felt that her political connections and reputation helped ease the process for her.

However, as Shrestha emphasized, the nagarikta is not the only paperwork: “Changing [your] nagarikta is important, but just having one document changed doesn’t mean you’re finished—there’s all the other ones, then there are the forms that the people checking your documents need to fill out.” Other interviewees, including Rukshana Kapali, whose case at the Supreme Court is detailed later in this report, stressed similar issues in comprehensively changing their documents.

For Sarita L., undergoing gender-affirming surgery in India in 2020 led her to seek a medical verification exam at Bir Hospital, a government hospital in central Kathmandu, in 2021. “Other people I knew had gone through it and said it was fine, not great but fine, so I just decided to get it over with,” she said. Sarita had asked to be seen by only one doctor, but once she entered the clinic room, two others came in. “I didn’t like it, but I thought they were doctors, so I had to do what they wanted.” The plastic surgeon overseeing the first part of her exam called in his colleagues to observe: eight in total. “I felt like I had to do it, let them touch me, let them watch. A woman doctor put her fingers in my vagina and when I winced in pain, she removed them,” she said. After that experience, she stopped pursuing the subsequent steps in the administrative process and has not been comfortable seeing a doctor since then.

Dipeksha M., the 26-year-old trans woman in Kathmandu, described how despite undergoing gender-affirming surgeries and acquiring all of the supposedly required documentation for medical verification, she still faced significant hurdles in the process. Dipeksha first submitted her documents to the Medical Board at Bir Hospital for verification. After following up daily with the office, she was told three weeks later to come and collect the documents. She said:

I had to put my legal name on the registration list with the clerk, so when they called me to see the doctor, they were calling my deadname. It was the first time I got deadnamed in a long time, and the first time following my surgery, so that was quite jarring.

The officials handed her back her documents, which were stamped “Certified.” Next, she had to undergo medical exams. The first was with a plastic surgeon. The senior plastic surgeon was not in that day, so she was told to come back in a week. “When I went back, I did get to meet that senior doctor, but I had to insist that a woman nurse be in the room, which seemed to irritate him, but he didn’t resist,” Dipeksha said. The nurse inspected Dipeksha’s genitals before the doctor did as well, although the doctor did not touch her during the exam. “Having to come out repeatedly and explain and justify yourself to a hospital clerk or administrative staffer in a public setting with dozens of people who could listen in—it’s exhausting and terrifying,” she said.

Following the exam, Dipeksha took the medical paperwork back to the Medical Board, but the clerk said the meeting was going to be delayed, so she should come back the following week. She returned prepared to wait it out.

I brought my laptop and some books and just did work sitting there, refusing to leave. I’m tall and I speak English and own a laptop—that signals something to the officials that they should take me seriously. Not everyone can pull that off. I basically just performed all of my privilege until they did what I needed.

But receiving the recommendation letter from the Medical Board was just the beginning for Dipeksha, as it is for most trans people in Nepal who elect to undergo these steps. She had to return to the ward office in the district where she was born and begin a negotiation process with them to accept the Medical Board’s letter. “No one in the ward office even knew what transgender meant,” Dipeksha said. “So me showing them these medical documents and asking them write a letter to the Chief District Officer [CDO] about changing my legal gender was mind-boggling to them.” She had to return for several days to argue with the officials, who repeatedly told her, “We’re not sure if we can trust you.”

Eventually, Dipeksha decided to travel to the District Administration Office, which was in a different town, and try to advocate for herself there. Upon arrival, she realized that she had interacted with the CDO staffer because they had both worked previously at the same INGO, and so they struck up a conversation as former colleagues. “She was eager to help me, so she called the ward office while I sat there and told them to write the letter to her so she could process it.” Dipeksha traveled back to the ward office the next day, received the letter, and then carried it to the CDO’s office the following day.

After that, Dipeksha had to submit all of the letters—from the Medical Board, Ward Office, and CDO—to the Ministry of Home Affairs. In addition, Dipeksha understood that she had to include her original birth certificate and her original nagarikta. She called in a favor with a colleague at the United Nations Nepal country office to ask if they could send the documents in a diplomatic pouch, and they agreed. At the time of her interview with Human Rights Watch in December 2022, Dipeksha had been waiting for three months with no updates, which made her nervous. “When I’ve called [the Ministry of Home Affairs] for an update, they tell me they have to verify each of the documents on the phone, and sometimes officials in other offices don’t pick up, so it delays things,” she said.

Triya’s Experience with the Medical Verification Process In December 2022, Human Rights Watch and a Nepali LGBT rights activist joined Triya Rai, 43, at Bir Hospital in her effort to obtain a recommendation letter from the Nepal Medical Board that her legal gender be changed, a step in her so-called medical verification process. It is December 13, a sunny winter day in Kathmandu. Triya arrives at Bir Hospital, a bustling, over-capacity government facility in the center of the city, just before 9 a.m. She joins a queue to get a ticket and a book that will be used by doctors to document her care. We ride up three stories in an elevator. The first stop is in a small examination room. There are two men in sweatshirts sitting there; one has a mask on. Simran, an activist who has accompanied more than a dozen trans people through this same procedure, points for me, and then Triya, to sit, before she sits herself. Triya hands the booklet to one of the doctors, a plastic surgeon. He opens it and asks her what she’s there for. Triya darts her eyes over to Simran. “She’s transgender,” Simran says. “And she needs the medical letter to change her citizenship card.” The plastic surgeon starts writing in the book. A male patient enters and sits with the doctor who isn’t busy writing. The doctor writes instructions, mutters something about antibiotics, and sends the man away. Another man enters with a bloodied cast on his arm. The doctor sends him out, saying they will need the examination bed soon. Meanwhile, the plastic surgeon stops writing and gestures for Triya to go sit on the bed, which is crammed in a corner behind tattered curtains. She stands up, hiking up her down jacket so she can access her belt. He puts on gloves while she shuffles over to the bed. Simran pipes up: “Is there a female nurse here?” The doctor says yes and tells the man with the cast, who is standing in the doorway, to shout into the hallway for a female nurse. The nurse arrives two minutes later, and the surgeon stands up. They each yank one side of the curtain to close it, but it only covers about two-thirds of the space. Their examination takes about 90 seconds. The curtain is yanked. The doctor snaps off the gloves, sits down, and starts writing again. Triya emerges into our field of vision and sits next to the doctor. Simran asks: “Did he feel your breasts?” She nods. The guy with the arm cast is let in. There’s two more minutes of writing before we leave the examination room. Our second stop is a booth in the hallway, where Simran asks a woman for a form. She gets a two-page form plus a blank page. We shuffle Triya into the urology department. Simran goes inside to help Triya register—showing Triya’s legal male name and ID card to an elderly man with a ledger—then comes out to say: “we’re never allowed inside the urology exam room,” meaning we can’t accompany Triya for this exam. We sit in the hallway. Simran tells me she’s depressed: “I come here to help people who really want this, then I go to Singha Durbar [the government complex] to try to make this not happen anymore. It’s difficult. I hate this, but this is also a really good day for her, which is why she’s so happy, so I have to try to be happy with her so she has good feelings about it.” Triya comes out holding the form she received earlier. Simran snatches it and we walk 10 paces back to the booth where she had got it. She asks the woman inside for glue, takes a small envelope from Triya, and plucks out a single passport-style headshot: a recent image, with Triya’s long black hair pulled back. The form, in Nepali, is filled out in English and reads “gender dysphoria” in two boxes and in the third, “breast reconstruction—7 years back in Kathmandu (no documentation). Gender affirmation surgery stage I (vulva reconstruction) and chest reconstruction at Olmec Hospital—Delhi in December 2019.” On the next page in the top box: “well defined vulva. Vagina is lying above urethral opening. Breast well defined circa areola and nipple.” Simran glues a photo to the form and hands it back to the woman. I see the woman reading it and entering it into the ledger while two men lean over her, reading it too. They look up at Simran and crane their necks to look at Triya. The woman enters more information into her ledger and stamps a handwritten letter Simran wrote for Triya, which we take to the administration office (our third stop) for a signature. No one is inside that office, so we stand outside for 20 minutes. A man approaches. Simran recognizes him and asks him to sign. “A transgender form,” she says. He signs, not reading it. Our fourth stop is the Medical Board office. We sit next to a man in a mask holding a pile of papers. He asks Triya: “Why are you here?” “Nagarikta.” “Nagarikta?” “Nagarikta.” “Why?” “I need to change it.” He looks baffled. “At the Medical Board?” “Why are you here?” she asks him. “I am a kidney patient and I need financial support, so I am here asking for it.” He looks back at his papers then looks up. “Nagarikta? Here?” “Yes, I need to change it.” Three other men in the room listen to this exchange. Triya sits down between me and Simran. An hour later, everything is done. Triya is told to return the following week and check on the status of her letter. A positive result will be a letter from the Medical Board confirming she has a vagina and describing it as adequate to qualify her as a legal woman. We are at the hospital for just under three hours in total, during which time at least 17 people are made aware of Triya’s reason for being there. Four are licensed health care professionals; the rest are hospital administration staff or onlookers.

Ritu N., a 27-year-old trans woman, also had to submit to medical verification at Bir Hospital as part of her gender verification process, in her case in November 2022. She explained: “The male doctor touched my breasts, but the female nurse checked my genitals. They weren’t rude, so it was OK, and I’m just excited to never have to be the center of attention again when my name gets called.”

While Ritu managed to cope with how she was treated, others experienced the medical verification procedure as traumatizing. Anita L., a 29-year-old trans woman from Kavre district who now lives in Kathmandu, said that her medical verification procedure at Bir Hospital in 2018 made her so uncomfortable that she stopped the procedure and postponed it until a later time. “I didn’t like how the male doctors were looking at me,” she said. “So I called a woman doctor friend and asked for her help. After she called Bir Hospital and got a promise that a female nurse would be present for my exam, I returned.”

But despite the nurse’s presence, the exam was humiliating for Anita. “The male doctors still touched me a lot,” she said. “They touched my breasts and genitals and inserted an instrument into my vagina to test its size. It was really uncomfortable.”

Roya G., a 38-year-old trans woman from Chitwan district explained how she was eager to do whatever it took to change her documents when she began her legal gender recognition process in 2020. “I initiated the process from the Chitwan CDO, all the way up to the Ministry of Home Affairs in Kathmandu,” she said. “I didn’t know my rights, so I begged a lot, including at the hospital. I went three days in a row and begged them to give me the medical verification exam. I had no idea while I was begging for it that it would be so horrible.” This exam was the first time someone else had touched Roya’s body since she underwent gender-affirming surgery in 2019. There were two male doctors in the room and no nurse. “One of the male doctors put his fingers in my vagina and also touched me all over my genitals and breasts,” Roya said. “I had all the documents from my surgery, but [the doctors] still forced me to do that.”

Following her exam and the Medical Board’s approval, Roya’s original documents were sent to the Ministry of Home Affairs in Kathmandu. By December 2022, more than two years later, they had not been returned. “For two years, I haven’t been able to apply for any government services because they all require the original nagarikta,” she said.

The Particular Impact of Medicalization on Trans Men

Roshan, a 30-year-old trans man in Kathmandu, credits his survival as a trans person to having family support and finding community organizations as a teenager. “I got to meet other trans people, learn about their experiences, and make my own decisions,” he said. But for Roshan and other trans men, legal gender recognition amid the creeping medicalization of gender identity in Nepal has posed acute challenges.

When he was 23, Roshan started hormone therapy and, using five years of savings, when he was 26, he underwent top surgery (to remove his breasts) in Kathmandu. “It was expensive, and it was the surgeon’s first trans surgery,” Roshan said. “I was left with big, painful scars, but I’m glad I did it.”

The surgeon advised Roshan to continue with gender-affirming operations, including a hysterectomy. “I tried to get one at a government hospital because it would be cheaper there and I was out of money, but they told me it would be illegal because my uterus wasn’t damaged,” Roshan said. The doctors told him that they could proceed with the hysterectomy if he got a letter from the Ministry of Health. Roshan tried for five months to obtain such a letter, but despite polite assurances from staff at the Ministry of Health, he never received it.

“Now when I approach my ward office, they say they want to see a ‘sex change certificate’ from the Nepal Medical Board,” Roshan said. He explained

The problem is, the surgeries I would need in order to get that, namely a phalloplasty, cannot be done in Nepal. And moreover, I don’t even want one. The Nepal Medical Board just wants to know if I have a penis or not. They’re not checking the penises of cisgender men, so I’m not sure why they have the right to look at my genitals.

The medicalization of legal gender recognition also raised significant barriers for Arun P., a 38-year-old trans man in the city of Nepalgunj. In 2018, he visited the District Administration Office (DAO) and requested to change his legal gender to male. “They told me I could change my name but not my gender,” Arun said. “The staff at the [DAO] specifically said that no gender change on nagarikta was possible until I got surgery.” He asked if he could get the “O” marker on his ID without surgery, but the officials said no and that surgery was required for any change to legal gender. “I felt awful in that moment—I felt as if I am not part of this world,” he said.

Arun left his family home when he was 18, after his parents made two attempts to marry him to men; one was his age and one much older. He lives on his own now, supporting himself as an outreach worker at a small NGO and doing odd jobs. His birth certificate is at his family home, and he is not sure family members would give it to him if he asked, adding yet another obstacle. Like other trans people, he has faced harassment and public humiliation due to his gender marker at airports, public toilets, while voting, and in seeking formal employment. However, Arun is intimidated by the potential cost of the surgery he was told to get in order to change his gender marker. “It’s very expensive,” he said, noting that he often comes up short on paying rent.

Procedures for changing legal gender are para-official, inconsistent, and difficult to navigate. Parina Chowdhury, a prominent trans woman activist in Nepalgunj, said her personal relationships with local government officials allowed her and some other well-connected and famous trans people to avoid medical verification procedures. Still, in her own encounters and those of other trans people she helped with the process, medicalization norms influenced how officials interacted with them.

In 2021, Parina underwent gender-affirming surgery in India and then approached the CDO in Nepalgunj with a request to change her legal gender to “O.” “He asked me ‘what is your proof?” and I replied ‘I am the proof,’” she said. “That was enough—he accepted it and wrote a recommendation letter, I never had to get a medical test.” But Parina was quick to acknowledge that it was her existing relationship with the official that led to this non-medicalized process. “Of course he knows me, everyone knows me around here,” she said. “And if that wasn’t the case, I would still have a male nagarikta with a dhaka topi in my photo.”

A Complaint to the National Human Rights Commission On December 8, 2022, Ashika Thapa, a trans woman in the city of Bhairahawa, filed a complaint with the regional office of the National Human Rights Commission. The full text is below, translated from Nepali to English: National Human Rights Commission, Lumbini Province. Subject: Requesting justice and compensation Dear Sir/Madam, My name is Ashish Thapa (Ashika). I am a transgender woman living in Tilottama Municipality, Ward No. 5. I went to the District Administration Office, Bhairahawa with a letter of recommendation from Ward No. 5 Office requesting nagarikta that reflected my gender identity. But the chief of administration handed me a letter asking me to get examined by a physician and to come back with evidence of my transgender status. I went to the Lumbini Provincial Hospital, Butwal, along with that letter and got examined by Dr. Bhuwan (surgeon) by baring my whole body. As the medical examination did not lead to any result, they (the hospital authorities) did not give me any written evidence. I am currently without citizenship documents, which has prevented me from doing many things. In this way, the District Administration Office, Bhairahawa has made fun of me and my gender identity in this manner. [Through this letter], I am requesting that the National Human Rights Commission take steps as soon as possible in order for me to acquire citizenship that reflects my gender identity and arrange for compensation for baring my identity (humiliating me by asking me to undress). As you command, Your Honor! Petitioner: Ashish Thapa (Ashika)

Medicalization and Social Services

Interviewees described how government officials used medicalized justifications to deny not only citizenship document changes, but also other social services.

Raju B., a 35-year-old trans man from the far west of Nepal, explained how he had not pursued legal gender recognition because it would require him to obtain documents from his family, from whom he was estranged. He had not lived with them for 13 years, after they tried twice to force him into heterosexual marriages. “I also hear from my peers about how badly they’ve been treated in the process, so I assume I would get treated the same. It’s too much for me to go into it knowing how awful it will be,” he said. Raju worked part-time for some NGOs over the years but struggled to support himself outside of the family home, so he was excited to learn in 2018 that the government was offering social security support for sexual and gender minorities.

“I went to the social security office with two other trans friends and the official told us ‘we can’t give you money because we can’t be sure you are really sexual and gender minorities,’” Raju said, explaining that the subsequent conversation between the officials that day suggested they incorrectly believed that all sexual and gender minorities were intersex. Consequently, Raju worked with a community-based organization to set up a meeting and information session to educate the officials about the range of sexual orientation and gender identity categories. Unfortunately, the session did not help Raju as hoped. He recalled the feedback from the officials at the end of the session was that “There are too many identities, so we won’t be able to provide social security to that many people. You need to have the ‘O’ marker on your nagarikta plus provide medical proof in order to receive this benefit.” Raju challenged them on the additional medical requirement, explaining that if the nagarikta said “other,” that should suffice for all government offices. He told us that the official replied: “Because you can’t reproduce, you need to go through a medical verification. Only a physician can tell us if you are really a sexual and gender minority community member.”

While medicalization has crept into some applicants’ experience, others have faced outright rejection. “I went to the DAO [in Nepalgunj] in 2013 and asked for my gender to be changed to ‘other,’” said Nandini L., a 32-year-old trans woman in Nepalgunj. “They told me, ‘If we change this document for you, we will get arrested.’ They didn’t ask me for surgery documents—I even had those from my castration in India—they just said that even with surgery proof, it wasn’t possible at all.”

Impact of Inadequate Legal Gender Recognition Policy

To force them to live an intimidating and invisible life by forcing them to hide their identity and live differently from how they would rather live with a sense of their own gender experience is to violate the rights of the sexual minority community.

—Pant v. Nepal, Supreme Court of Nepal, 2017

I would like to change my legal gender. It would bring me so much inner happiness—to feel that I am recognized and respected like that would be my biggest dream.

—Nandini L., 26, Nepalgunj, December 15, 2022

The right to recognition as a person before the law is a fundamental aspect of affirming the dignity and worth of every person. For transgender people whose documents do not recognize them according to their gender identity and appearance, everyday interactions can be fraught with humiliation and danger. Transgender people in Nepal interviewed for this report described how the lack of legal gender recognition, combined with pervasive and harmful stereotypes, has limited their ability to access services and exposed them to daily indignities.

Citizenship cards, according to a Supreme Court judgment discussing legal recognition for trans people, “must be obtained for the operation of day-to-day business.” But when trans people are blocked from changing their legal gender, they are forced to improvise on a daily basis. “I try to hide my ID documents as much as possible,” Raju B. said. “The NGO where I used to work gave me an employee ID that has my male name and photo on it and that seems to work in most places, so I just use that unless an official demands to see a government document.” Dipeksha M. described a similar tactic: “I use my [former INGO employer] ID to go to the bank and at the airport. It’s working for now, but it expires in a few months, and I have no idea what I’ll do after that.”

At an event hosted by Blue Diamond Society and UN Women in Kathmandu on December 22, 2023, Dr. Roshan Pokhrel, a psychiatrist and the secretary of health at the Ministry of Population and Health, said: “I commit to creating a simple and accessible process for people to change their legal gender.”

Complexities of the “Other” Gender Legal Category

The introduction of a third gender category into the Nepali systems has been implemented with mixed results.

Some of the complications are rooted in the definition of the third gender category. Within this category, there are numerous identities and expressions. An open-ended gender question posed as part of a survey of more than 1,200 sexual and gender minorities in Nepal conducted in 2013 captured more than seven common identity terms. According to anthropologist David Gellner, “Politically aware Nepalis understood very well that this was a heterogenous category mobilized in order to bring pressure on, and claim resources from, the state, even though many people found the new term confusing and even inappropriate.” Scholar Kumud Rana examined identity formation in her study of sexual and gender minorities in Nepal, explaining that “the ‘third gender,’ ‘meti,’ and ‘natuwa’ are different variations of the same category …However [individuals] thought of these categories as distinct from each other even though one person might identify with more than one of these categories.” Rana concluded that “reportedly indigenous terms … were all understood as gender—but also sexually-transgressive subjectivities which are all equivalent to each other, and to tesro lingi [third gender].” This observation accords with the Supreme Court’s capacious use of “third gender” to refer to a range of identities and expressions in Pant v. Nepal (2007).

While such a flexible and capacious category, based on the principle of self-identification, is a step forward and accords with human rights standards, it is not sufficient: trans individuals who identify as male or female and who object to being placed in the third gender category should be able to seek and gain state recognition as male or female.

Some trans people are comfortable using terminology anchored in indigenous categories to refer to their identity, and their rights can be recognized by a third gender marker on documents and records. Others are not, as they identify with male or female categories; their rights to legal recognition should not be circumscribed to either choosing to carry documents reflecting their birth-assigned sex, or a third gender marker. The male and female categories should be available to them as well, on the same principle of “self-feeling.”

The Nepali government, working with civil society, has made considerable strides in opening space for sexual and gender minorities, including trans people, to enjoy their fundamental rights. However, by limiting the available gender marker for trans people to “other” (and not including “male” or “female” as gender marker options for trans people), the current system is inadequate. This combined with uneven application of the law, and an increased reliance on medical certification, leads to individual rights violations for trans people in Nepal, including in public spaces and employment opportunities.

Harassment and Humiliation in Public Spaces

Simply going from one place to another can be a dangerous and humiliating experience for people whose documents do not match their gender expression. The stakes are high, particularly for international travel, ranging from fraud accusations and exposure to intense scrutiny and humiliation. UN human rights experts have condemned such targeting of transgender people in security processes.

These barriers impact trans people in Nepal, and nearly every trans person interviewed for this report described an instance of interrogation, humiliation, or delay when attempting to access transportation. Gendered queues at airport security were a frequently cited problem; instances on buses were also mentioned.

Raju B., a trans man who would like documents listing him as male but does not have them, recounted a trip to Delhi:

At the Kathmandu airport, the official looked at my ID and sent me to the female queue. The women in the queue stared at me and whispered, then after a few minutes, a guard pulled me out of the queue and berated me, telling me to go to the male queue. When I got to the front of the male queue, the guard there looked at my ID and shouted “why are you here, sister?”

Raju explained that this situation ended thanks to a friend advocating for him by shouting back at the airport official until he relented and allowed Raju to stand in the female queue.

Kathmandu airport staff harassed Dipeksha M., a 26-year-old trans woman, in the summer of 2022 on the night she returned from her gender-affirming surgery in Thailand. “It was 2 a.m. and the guard insisted on patting me down, then shouted at me ‘this isn’t you!’ in front of the whole queue of other people trying to pass through immigration,” she said.

Ritu N., a 27-year-old trans woman from Tanahun district, faced similar harassment at the Kathmandu airport.

In September of 2022, after I had had my surgery in Bangkok, officials at the Kathmandu airport for a domestic flight harassed me because of my gender marker. I had to explain myself, my body, my surgery in Bangkok. They held my ID for over an hour, and discussed amongst themselves whether it was really me on the card. That was the point where I realized I needed to pursue a new ID. I realized it might involve some awful moments with a doctor and it might take years to get the new card, but it’s better than the daily humiliations.

For Roya G. and Gita G., trans women in Kathmandu who do sex work, discordant gender markers have created physical and financial vulnerabilities. Roya explained how she is very careful with sex work clients in terms of disclosing that she is trans. “I’ve been beaten, blackmailed, and denied payment by clients once they discover I am trans, so I hide it all the time,” she said. “I can’t have them see any document that indicates my legal name or gender because I haven’t changed it yet.” Gita explained another problem posed by her legal gender:

Sex work clients increasingly want to pay with apps, but when I register with an app, I have to register with my bank account, which is in my legal male name, so that’s what shows up on the app. I get nervous when new clients, or clients who don’t know I’m trans, see my app profile with my male name.

Barriers to Employment

The limited options for legal gender recognition and lack of consistent application of the Supreme Court’s orders in Nepal has negatively impacted transgender individuals’ ability to secure employment and their right to be treated with dignity and respect. This puts transgender people at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to finding and keeping a job. In a 2021 study of 200 trans women in Kathmandu, researchers found that 78 percent of respondents had been denied employment, they believed, because of their gender identity.

Roshan B., a trans man in Kathmandu, attempted to gain employment in the formal sector but got denied once the employer noticed the discordance on his citizenship card. “I sent in my CV and nagarikta (with a female gender marker, name, and photo) and the company called me for an interview for a receptionist position,” he said. “But when I arrived, the boss said ‘oh, we expected a pretty lady, not you—so we can’t hire you.’”

“Having a ‘F’ document will make looking for formal employment easier,” said one interviewee, a 43-year-old trans woman who does sex work. “I have tried to get other jobs, but they either reject me directly or just never call me back. I’m a competent person, and I think I can get work.”

For Anita L., 29, every time she has been hired, formally or informally, she ends up facing harassment at work. “People put me under scrutiny because my voice is a little deep or my mannerisms aren’t 100% traditionally feminine,” she said. “I accept and express myself as trans but that doesn’t mean people are allowed to harm me, and it doesn’t mean the government should play a role in making a bad situation worse by creating obstacles to me obtaining a proper ID.”

Chandika N., a 50-year-0ld trans woman in Nepalgunj, has only ever worked in the informal sector “because every time I would try to get a more formal job, such as at a hotel as a cleaner, they would say ‘but you’re a woman and this document says man, so bring us another one or we can’t hire you.’” Chandika heard that if she gets surgery, she can change her documents to “F,” but given her economic precariousness, the financial barriers make the surgery impossible to imagine:

I want to get food first, and health care and housing. Then if I have more money, I’ll go for surgery, I guess. It would be better to just have the new documents without spending all that money on surgery.

Impact of Covid-19 Measures

Emergency and crisis situations such as the Covid-19 pandemic exacerbate structural inequalities, including for LGBT people. While struggles with stigma, discrimination, and violence are experienced by various marginalized populations, LGBT people may be disproportionately impacted in specific ways. Narrow definitions of gender and family can put LGBT people at risk of exclusion from aid, relief, and services.

In Nepal, as this report documents, and in other parts of the world, many transgender people do not have ID documents that match their identity and expression. This means any time they have to show ID to an official—for example, to travel or access healthcare or aid—potentially poses risks. Services that are distributed in a sex-segregated manner are potentially discriminatory for people who express one gender and carry an ID that lists another. This situation can occur in humanitarian assistance situations, as aid and relief are often delivered to “family” units, which can be strictly defined as one-man/one-woman households, thus excluding many LGBT people and families.

Although disaster response mechanisms in Nepal already failed to include trans people prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, the government is making the same mistakes. “The relief packages from the government after the 2015 earthquake and during the Covid-19 pandemic required ID, which made it basically impossible for trans people who hadn’t gotten their documents changed to present for relief services,” Roshan B., a trans man in Kathmandu told Human Rights Watch.

The pandemic further exposed the ongoing exclusions of and challenges for LGBT people in crises, prompting the Nepal UN Women office and activists, including Rukshana Kapali, to write a Feminist and Queer Charter of Demands in Response to Covid-19 in Nepal.

Raju B., a trans man, explained:

The reality is that Covid lockdowns made employment, which was bad before for us, even worse. A lot of us had broken with our families and moved out to rented rooms, so we really needed income. When that stopped because of lockdowns, some of us had to go back and live with our families. And staying inside with them all the time—it was torture for some of us. They really treated us badly and made us feel horrible all the time. I know of two suicides of lesbian friends in the past two years near here as a result of this. Economic independence is our safety; without it, we are at risk of constant poor treatment.

According to the Astraea Foundation, “Many LGBTQI+ individuals could not return to families that had abandoned them in the first place” to alleviate the financial stresses caused by Covid-19’s impact on Nepal’s economy.

Nepal has international legal obligations to make Covid-19 vaccines available and accessible to everyone. Upstream barriers to accessing Covid-19 vaccines put governments such as Nepal, who do not have the purchasing power to compete with wealthier governments, at a disadvantage. The failure of wealthy governments and pharmaceutical companies to share the intellectual property and transfer the relevant manufacturing technology created an artificial scarcity of lifesaving vaccines. Despite considerable financial and intellectual property-related barriers, Nepal eventually obtained adequate vaccine doses.

Discrimination against people whose ID documents have gender markers different from their appearance has been another barrier to vaccines for some trans people. While the Nepali government obtained vaccines to cover its entire population, availability and accessibility are not the same thing. This can be especially true for marginalized populations, like trans people, who already face discrimination and barriers to health care.

Arun P., a trans man in Nepalgunj, recounted his struggle to get vaccinated.

I first went to a government vaccination site, but I had to show my ID. And the person there asked “why are you carrying this ‘F’ nagarikta? This isn’t you.” They told me to come back later, but the next day, another person just said the same thing. I realized they were never going to let me get the vaccine, so I just stopped going. I only got a Covid vaccine injection because BDS had them at the office.

Advocacy efforts by BDS and its affiliate organizations across the country resulted in a third gender option being added to vaccine cards as well as targeted outreach to trans people during Covid-19 vaccine campaigns in some areas, leading to improved access. GAVI, the global vaccine organization, explained the positive shift: “A rigid male/female ID system in Nepal was preventing many members of the country’s transgender community from getting the COVID-19 jab. A group of activists, working with the government, is turning things around.”

National Jurisprudence on Gender Identity and Human Rights

I completely disapprove of the medicalized process for legal gender recognition. The whole idea is incoherent—they would never ask a cisgender person to get a genital exam if they lost their nagarikta and needed a replacement. Gender verification through genitals makes no sense; they’re just doing this because they want to control us.

—Shilpa Chowdhury, a trans activist from Dang district, December 11, 2022

The creeping medicalization of legal gender recognition in Nepal is nested in a complex interface that involves the administrative state, the sociopolitical authority afforded to medical practitioners, and the urgent, pragmatic desires of trans people to recognition before the law. With the beginning of the peace process in 2006 and the promulgation of the Interim Constitution in January 2007, a wave of LGBT rights activism successfully used constitutional litigation. Successive Supreme Court judgments have ordered authorities to implement a procedure based on a trans person’s self-identification—for a third gender category, or for male and female categories—and respect the rights of trans people through inclusion in social schemes. The court’s existing analysis should guide future judgments, including the cases currently pending at time of writing, and the development of legislation related to trans people’s rights.

Sunil Babu Pant and others v. Nepal (2007)

The original case, Pant and others v. Nepal, remains foundational in its orders to respect the self-proclaimed gender identity of trans people and its specific instructions to amend citizenship documents to include a third gender based solely on the criterion of “self-feeling.”

The Supreme Court in 2007 was unambiguous in its conclusions about the human rights of trans people:

If any legal provisions exist that restrict the people of third gender from enjoying fundamental rights and other human rights provided by Part III of the Constitution and international conventions relating to the human rights which Nepal has already ratified and applied as national laws, with their own identity, such provisions shall be considered as arbitrary, unreasonable and discriminatory. Similarly, the action of the state that enforces such laws shall also be considered as arbitrary, unreasonable and discriminatory.

The bulk of the judgment’s citations were European cases involving legal gender recognition for trans people who have undergone surgeries. However, in line with the then-recent Yogyakarta Principles, justice Bala Ram KC wrote that the sole criterion for being legally recognized as third gender in Nepal would be based on self-identification, not on any medical (or other) criteria: “Legal provisions should be made to provide for gender identity to the people of transgender or third gender, under which female third gender, male third gender and intersexual are grouped, as per the concerned person’s self-feeling.”

The judgment reads:

It is wrong to say that a person’s sex depends on some limited range of factors, such as the state of the person’s gonads, Chromosomes or genitals (whether at birth or at some other time)… the relevant matters include the person’s biological and physical characteristics at birth; … the person’s self perception as a man or woman; … and the person’s biological, psychological and physical characteristics at the time of the marriage, including any biological features of the person’s brain that are associated with a particular sex.

Dilu Buduja v. Nepal (2015)

In this case, the Supreme Court directed the government to issue passports with gender markers that align with those who had a third indicator on their nagarikta. The petitioner was a citizen who had changed his legal gender on his nagarikta to “third” and applied for a passport listing him as “third.” The passport office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied the passport request, and told the Supreme Court that they could not issue a passport with a gender other than “male” or “female” because their software had already been set to only accommodate two gender categories.

Arguing that “Third-gender individuals are also human,” the court ordered the passport office to update its software and issue passports in three genders. Citing advances in “third,” “other,” and “X” passports issued by other countries, global passport regulations set by the International Civil Aviation Organization, and the adjustments that had already been made in Nepal to include a third gender category on citizenship documents and the census, the court stated:

Given that such efforts have been made, without discrimination, to recognize them at par with the general citizens, there can be no question about not being able to provide the third-gender recognition in the sought passport in accordance with the petitioner's demand.

Sunil Babu Pant and others v. Nepal (2017)

Pant and two trans activists petitioned the Supreme Court to order the government to facilitate the legal recognition of the “other” gender category on citizenship documents. The applicants had attempted to start the legal gender change process in their home districts, much as in the cases documented in this report, but their applications were either denied or severely delayed. The government’s responses to the court indicated that the authorities felt the law was clear and trans people had the right to change their legal gender, but failures of implementation at a local level was not the central authorities’ concern. Ultimately, the court sided with the petitioners and ordered the government “to amend and modify the necessary laws regarding this matter,” specifically calling for name—and not only gender—changes to be possible on official documents.

The judgment, reproduced in full in Appendix 2, also featured strong human rights arguments for allowing self-identification in legal gender recognition procedures, including:

· “It is solely the individual right to self-determination of any person to acquire gender identity as per his/her perception. It is not relevant to determine the biological gender of any person by other person, society, state or the law. Any provisions injurious to independent reputation and dignity of human being shall not be acceptable from the viewpoint of human rights.”

· “To have to remain with identity cards that are different from their actual identity means for the gender minority community that their self-respect is hurt and that their sense of community ownership is weakened. To force them to live an intimidating and invisible life by forcing them to hide their identity and live differently from how they would rather live with a sense of their own gender experience is to violate the rights of the sexual minority community.”

Rukshana Kapali v. Nepal (2021)

In this case, trans activist Rukshana Kapali has petitioned the Supreme Court on the basis of the 2015 constitution, which explicitly recognizes the rights of sexual and gender minorities, previous Supreme Court decisions, and international standards to order education authorities to amend relevant certificates and diplomas with her gender identity. Kapali had attempted to be legally recognized as “female” on her original citizenship card when she turned 16 (the age when the nagarikta is acquired) in 2015. Despite her request, the nagarikta was produced identifying her as “other” gender, and her subsequent attempts to have her educational registration documents, exams, and diplomas issued with her chosen female name and her female gender identity were denied.

“I have had to face hurdles in different places for four years as my certificate and identity card are not according to my real identity,” she wrote in her petition.. Her writ petition, which is featured in Appendix 4, details the grueling steps she has taken since 2015 to amend her nagarikta and other documents, and the Kafkaesque outcomes she has endured. For example, she writes:

I have two passports. The first was issued on 16 January, 2017. In the passport I got my gender description “F” (female). I have had the opportunity to attend many international conferences and travel abroad frequently. After my passport sheets expired, I applied for a new passport. But at that time, as my citizenship mentioned “other”, people filing the form started making counter-questions saying that I should not apply for “female”. I was in a hurry to get a visa to attend a conference in Canada. On 20 September, 2018, another passport was issued in which the gender details “O” (Other) was stated.

Interim Order (2023)

While Kapali awaited her delayed hearing at the Supreme Court, she received additional bad news. Purbanchal University law school, where she had been enrolled as a student, withheld her exam results, insisting that they can only be released in her deadname and sex assigned at birth.

Kapali appealed to the Supreme Court, asking that the university and relevant government authorities

not state her dead gender, that her gender identity be amended on her SLC [an official document indicating results for class 10 exam] that the results of her first year of BA LLB not be withheld, and that she be allowed to take the examinations of the second year of BA LLB in a dignified manner.

On January 6, 2023, the Court ordered the National Examinations Board to release her results according to her gender identity and name, finding that:

[N]ot allowing any person to enroll at a school or university based on their gender identity, not allowing them to obtain an education, or preventing them from taking an examination would appear to be a serious violation of the rights enshrined in the Constitution.

The Court further elaborated:

Gender identity is an individual’s private matter. In order for an individual to freely enjoy their personal liberties and right to live with dignity, the dignity and respect for gender identity must be upheld. The Constitution of Nepal has guaranteed the right to education as a fundamental right. In this vein, it is clear that gender identity may not be an obstruction on any ground when it comes to obtaining an education. Linking the issue of gender identity to education and using that as a basis to create any hindrance to university enrollment or any act related to learning goes against all the provisions envisaged by the Constitution for an individual’s human dignity and it is an unexpected situation that cannot even be imagined in civilized society. This makes a mockery of the constitutionally guaranteed right to live with dignity. If an undesirable obstruction is created in the way of a citizen’s right to obtain an education, then fundamental rights lose purpose for them.

The order concluded by instructing the National Examinations Board not to withhold her results, not to obstruct her access to education due to her gender identity, and specifically not to obstruct her access to her educational results on the basis of her gender identity.

At the time of publishing this report, Human Rights Watch was aware that Kapali’s case had been resolved by the Supreme Court, and that the judgment was in favor of the petitioner, but other explanatory details are unknown as of now.

Adheep Pokhrel and Tobias Volz. v. Ministry of Home Affairs, Department of Immigration (2023)

The case was brought by a gay couple—Adheep Pokhrel, a Nepali citizen, and Tobias Volz, a German citizen. The pair were legally married in Germany in 2018. They applied for a non-tourist visa for Volz in July 2022, which would entitle him to the same rights to live in Nepal as a married heterosexual spouse in the same circumstance. Nepali authorities denied the request on the grounds that the application form reads “husband” and “wife” and does not recognize two husbands.

In addition to ordering the department of immigration to grant Volz a non-tourist visa, the court also instructed the government to urgently consider a 2015 court-ordered committee report (from Pant v. Nepal, 2007) that recommended broader recognition of same-sex relationships. The court ruled that failure to recognize same-sex spouses violates Nepal’s constitution and its international human rights obligations.

While the judgment primarily focuses on same-sex relationship recognition, it also involves nuanced discussions of terminology and human rights related to sexual orientation and gender identity. For example, the judgment explains:

Generally speaking, the term ""third gender"" is used to indicate communities other than men and women. In several documents, the use of ""third gender"" also refers to the transgender community. Given the current context where various terms of gender identity have been developed and individuals are openly identifying themselves with those identities, ""third gender"" cannot denote everyone and, therefore, the use of such a term can potentially diminish the identity of the members of the gender and sexual minority community as a whole. At a time when there seems to be a general agreement to use the more inclusive term SOGIESC [sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, and sex characteristics] instead of LGBTIQA+ [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer, and asexual], which cannot represent the entire non-binary community, the use of ""third gender"" to address the entire non-binary community would seem contrary to the principle of inclusion as well.

The judgment makes important strides in clarifying terminology related to gender identity and, while acknowledging that a range of identities may be understood under a “third gender” heading and some people may pursue legal recognition as “third gender,” others may identify as male, female, or a range of indigenous identity terms.

International Law and Legal Gender Recognition

In its 2014 review of Nepal, the UN Human Rights Committee, which monitors state compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), complimented Nepal’s progress on transgender rights, noting “[t]he introduction of a third gender in various official documents, including citizenship certificates, pursuant to the Supreme Court judgment of 21 December 2007.” In its currently-pending review of Nepal, the Human Rights Committee has asked the government to indicate what steps it has taken to protect against discrimination on the basis of gender identity.

The ICCPR, which Nepal ratified in 1991, provides for equal civil and political rights for all (article 3), the right to recognition for everyone before the law (article 16), the right to privacy (article 17), and equality before the law and the equal protection of the law without discrimination on any grounds, including sex (article 26).

The right to recognition is captured in Principle 3 of the Yogyakarta Principles on the Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, which was developed by international human rights experts, including former Member of Parliament in Nepal, Sunil Babu Pant, and endorsed by the UN. Principle 3 states that:

Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law. Persons of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities shall enjoy legal capacity in all aspects of life.

Data confirms that the impacts of the climate crisis fall hardest on countries and people who are already struggling and who have contributed the least to climate change. But the right policies can both confront the climate crisis and protect and improve people’s social and economic rights.

Low- and middle-income countries are disproportionately vulnerable to rising sea levels, severe storms, and extreme heat due to climate change, and marginalized people are most susceptible to the damage caused by these events.

To make matters worse, when policies intended to confront the climate crisis are poorly designed, they can also fall hardest on people who are less well-off, widening inequalities. For example, policies that increase energy costs without an adequate redistribution mechanism – such as flat carbon taxes or removing fossil fuels subsidies – risk increasing the cost of living , which can weigh most heavily on those with the lowest incomes. This can make people feel like they are forced to choose between feeding their families and a livable planet.

But correctly designed climate policies could help mitigate inequality in economies. At COP27, the 2022 UN Climate Change Conference, states established the Just Transition Work Programme (JTWP) to start doing just that. The scope and design of the JTWP, which is a process to generate ideas and build consensus among governments, was further developed at COP28. The resulting final declaration calls for two annual dialogues, think formal discussions. It also identifies key topics within the scope of a just transition, such as the socioeconomic dimension of transition, sustainable development and poverty elimination, social protection and labor rights, and international cooperation.

Today, the Climate Action Network, a global network of more than 1,900 civil society organizations, including Human Rights Watch, urged the JTWP to focus its dialogues on ensuring that countries’ approaches to enable a just transition are inclusive and participatory. Dialogues should also focus on the mobilization of resources to support people whose incomes, access to resources, or eco-systems are harmed by the transition. The JTWP should also address agricultural and food systems, and the impact of climate policies – such as removing fossil fuel subsidies – and universal social security.

The stakes are high.

“We are deeply grateful for the Dutch Postcode Lottery’s renewed partnership,” said Tirana Hassan, executive director at Human Rights Watch. “With the Postcode Lottery’s vital support, we will continue to address deep-rooted inequities and work toward a world in which nobody is left behind.”

The partnership has contributed to positive change for millions of people around the world. It helped get aid flowing to Venezuela’s people in need, raised pressure on Brazil to stop burning in the Amazon region, led Tanzania to allow pregnant girls and young mothers to return to school, and resulted in 119 countries committing to end using schools for military purposes.

The Dutch Postcode Lottery is part of the Postcode Lottery Group, which operates in Germany, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. Since its founding in 1989, the Group has donated more than €12.6 billion to good causes, making it the third largest private donor in the world.",LOW,20240214T151500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Tirana Hassan, executive director at Human Rights Watch",Various global entities,Global,Sustain and expand successful partnerships; increase advocacy on urgent issues.,Human rights violations and neglect of justice,Netherlands,"Systemic inequities, climate change, conflict"

Thank you for inviting all of us to testify today about this increasingly worrying issue. For decades, Human Rights Watch and other groups have documented how various governments around the world have reached beyond their borders to engage in repression of human rights defenders, journalists, civil society activists, dissidents, political opponents, and others deemed to be a security or political threat. This is what has come to be labeled transnational repression: governments reaching over their borders to commit abuses against their citizens or members of their diaspora.

Transnational repression has taken the form of targeted killings, abductions and enforced disappearances, unlawful deportations, abuse of consular services, the targeting and collective punishment of relatives. It can also take the form of digital attacks, including threats, harassment, cyber-hacking, doxing, or swatting.

Understandably, some US policy makers are particularly concerned with transnational repression by governments that are hostile to the US, such as China, Russia, and Iran. The reporting of Human Rights Watch, Freedom House, and other groups has documented abuses by these countries but also by other governments in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. We have heard from victims of transnational repression and friends and relatives of victims about its impacts, not only on those targeted, but also on entire communities who are intimidated or silenced by it.

Increasingly, we are also documenting transnational repression abuses by governments that enjoy close ties with the United States, countries with which the US is expanding economic, security, and intelligence ties.

At this hearing, Human Rights Watch wants to focus on two such countries in particular: Rwanda and India.

We would request that the committee place into evidence a written submission on issues in Rwanda of my colleague Lewis Mudge, of Human Rights Watch’s Africa Division.

I will here focus on India and go into further detail.

Like Rwanda, India has relatively close diplomatic ties with the United States, and these ties have grown especially over the last 10 years. Yet during this period, India’s human rights situation has been rapidly deteriorating. The worsening situation—and increasing incidence of the government misusing legal institutions as well as committing rights violations against perceived enemies—is well documented in recent reports by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the American Bar Association, the US Commission on International Religious Freedom, and an especially disturbing report on India last week by the US Holocaust Memorial Museum.

And in recent years, we have seen this repression begin spilling over India’s borders.

As the committee is aware, the government of India has been placed in the spotlight by the recent indictment of an Indian national in New York City for allegedly attempting to hire an assassin to murder a Sikh Indian-American resident there, which echoes earlier accusations by the Canadian government about a similar plot there.

These are extraordinarily serious allegations, but they did not occur in a vacuum. They are linked to the deteriorating rights situation back in India. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government’s ultranationalist ideology promoting Hindu supremacy has fueled and encouraged violence against religious minorities, especially Muslims and Christians, but also attempted to label Sikh farmers protesting against government agriculture laws as Sikh separatists. Police and other authorities have failed to hold supporters of the BJP and members of BJP-affiliated groups to account for violence, often instead targeting members of marginalized communities or their advocates.

Within India, we have documented the BJP-led government’s attempts to silence dissent using intimidation and harassment of peaceful critics through raids and arbitrary arrests, including under the draconian Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, India’s primary counterterrorism law.

Outside of India, the Indian government is increasingly intimidating people via various denials of basic consular services—such as cancellations or refusals to renew passports or Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) booklets or refusing to allow diaspora members to enter the country. The government has a record of misusing OCI status to attack critics. Christine Mehta, a researcher with Amnesty International India, had her OCI status revoked in 2014 and was deported, apparently in retaliation for her work on an Amnesty report, published the following year, on human rights violations by Indian security forces in Jammu and Kashmir. In February, the government revoked the OCI status of Sweden based academic, Ashok Swain, because he has “persistently and willfully indulged in writings and inflammatory speeches that tarnished the image of the country and its institutions in the eyes of international community.”

A British journalist, Aatish Taseer, had his OCI revoked after he wrote a critical article about Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Time magazine, ostensibly due to his father’s Pakistani origins. In January 2024, the Indian Home Ministry sent a “show-cause notice” to French journalist Vanessa Dougnac with OCI status “because her reportage allegedly created a ‘biased negative perception of India.’” Dougnac, a resident of India for 22 years, denied the allegations and said she has “never engaged in any acts that are in any manner prejudicial to Indian interests as is being alleged,” and is cooperating with the “legal process.”

The ruling BJP is also increasingly using its online troll armies to harass and intimidate critics and journalists overseas, especially in the United States. A December 2023 Washington Post investigation on alleged online harassment described that an organization linked to Indian intelligence agencies “combined fact-based research with unsubstantiated claims to paint U.S. government figures, researchers, humanitarian groups and Indian American rights activists as part of a conspiracy, purportedly led by global Islamic groups and billionaire George Soros, to undermine India.”

The online capacities of the BJP have also been used to intimidate critics.

The case of Sabrina Siddiqui, of the Wall Street Journal, provides an example. Last summer, during a White House press conference during Prime Minister Modi’s visit to Washington, Siddiqui asked Modi a question about India’s human rights record.

Within hours, she came under withering attack from various senior officials in India’s ruling party, including the head of its so-called IT Cell, which has a record of leading mass trolling attacks against critics of the government. The wave of online attacks, much of which was ad hominem, questioned her objectivity based on false statements about her national origins.

This online criticism, both publicly and in private messaging over social media sites, contained explicit threats, including to kill her, rape her, and kill her then 13-month-old baby, among others. At their height, tweets mentioning Sabrina were being posted on X, formerly Twitter, at the rate of one per second.

The orchestration of this online campaign constituted conduct that—provided other factors were shown—would meet the legal definition of criminal threats, harassment, and intimidation prohibited by the federal stalking statute.

Siddiqui cancelled plans to travel to India in September 2023 during President Joe Biden’s trip to the G20 Summit, due to concerns about security.

These are apparent actions by the Indian government against a US citizen in the United States. And she is not alone. Other US citizens of Indian origin have faced online attacks of this kind, some in situations clearly indicating orchestration by the ruling party.

In recent months, I have spoken to several members of the Indian diaspora who have told me of concern about possible revocations of passports or OCI cards, which have increased in recent years, and feeling physically unsafe from mass online campaigns of threats and harassment. Even here, in Washington, or New York, over 7,000 miles from India, I have heard people tell me of feeling that they are at risk, that their children are at risk, on the grounds that the online harassment could inspire a BJP supporter to engage in violence against them.

People have told me that they have changed their behavior, kept a lower profile online, refrained from posting even innocuous comments about India—say, about its cricket team—for fear it might set off online attacks.

That is the impact on victims and their families and their personal security. But we should focus also on the other far-reaching effects of transnational repression, including its chilling effect on the rights to freedom of expression, association, and assembly, which harms all of us.

Transnational repression leads to self-censorship. Even if some reporters and human rights defenders continue their work, others cannot afford to do so. As a result, intended research and reporting on a government’s human rights record does not happen. Those who wish to report on incidents of abuse with which they are aware or investigated—and led them to flee their homeland—become justifiably afraid to report them.

And this impacts US government interests in promoting human rights abroad. Because of the Indian government’s transnational repression in the United States, information and debate about India’s human rights record is stifled. Statements and letters of concern go unwritten. Congressional hearings do not happen. Legislation is not introduced. Proper reviews of military sales or assistance to India do not occur.

Transnational repression harms the ability of democratic governments to obtain and craft human rights policy toward other countries. And this is especially worrying with governments that enjoy close diplomatic ties with the US—not just India but Bahrain, Ethiopia, Thailand, and Rwanda: countries that have with some success used transnational repression to blunt Washington’s criticism of their rights records.

What can the US Congress do about this? Human Rights Watch recommends that Congress should:

Maintain awareness that transnational repression comes not only from more hostile governments, but even with some that are close US allies.

Support recently proposed legislation to formalize State Department policy on transnational repression and assist victims and affected communities.

Communicate formally and informally with governments with close ties, like India and Rwanda, to express serious concerns with reports of their involvement in transnational repression and by raising specific cases.

Adopt targeted sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes, on those implicated in the most serious abuses.

Review extradition, legal cooperation, and intelligence-sharing agreements with governments involved in transnational repression. Identify agreements and processes that need additional oversight or that should be discontinued to prevent abuse.

(Kathmandu) – The government of Nepal should urgently create a clear, simple, and rights-respecting procedure that would allow transgender and third gender people to obtain official documents in accordance with their gender identity, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. While Nepali policy allows in principle for transgender to people to obtain documents marked “other,” implementation is piecemeal and those who want “male” or “female” as their legal gender are forced to undergo invasive and unnecessary medical interventions and examinations.

The 67-page report, “‘We Have to Beg So Many People’: Human Rights Violations in Nepal’s Legal Gender Recognition Practices,” documents the significant policy gaps that remain in the implementation of Nepal’s legal recognition for transgender people, despite global recognition of Nepal’s progress. Nepal’s pioneering recognition of a third gender “other” category based on self-identification garnered widespread praise and made Nepal an important touchpoint for the rights of sexual and gender minorities. But Nepal has no explicit legal option to change a gender marker to “male” or “female,” and even the procedure for the third gender option is unclear and ad hoc. Interactions between transgender people and the state have become particularly fraught with discriminatory, ill-informed, and requirements for harmful medical practices.

“We began the fight for our dignity in 2001 and we secured a major victory at the Supreme Court in 2007, but the government has not yet implemented the order to recognize us based on our identities,” said Manisha Dhakal, executive director at the Blue Diamond Society , an LGBT rights organization. “Generations of transgender and third gender Nepalis have faced barriers and humiliation because of policy gaps, and we need real change now.”

In 2007, the first Supreme Court judgment on sexual orientation and gender identity ordered the government to take three steps: audit all laws and scrap those that discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity; form a committee to study same-sex marriage policy options; and legally recognize a third gender category based on an individual’s own self-identification. The judgment in Pant et al. v. Nepal (2007) has been cited by courts around the world, including the Supreme Court of India, courts in the United States considering gender on passports, and the European Court of Human Rights, as a positive example. However, Nepali authorities continue to lag in carrying out the court’s order to recognize gender identity on the basis of self-identification.

Human Rights Watch found that some people – including people pursuing documents that list them as “third gender” or “other” – have been denied documents changing their gender or wrongly told they must undergo surgery to be eligible. A small number of people have been able to change their documents from “male” to “female,” but doing so invariably involves an invasive and humiliating physical exam in a medical setting, an experience that is rife with human rights violations.

“Trans women are women and trans men are men, and Nepal needs to match its reputation as a so-called beacon of hope for sexual and gender minorities with comprehensive policy change to respect our rights,” said Rukshana Kapali, chief executive officer at Queer Youth Group Nepal. “Nepal got a lot of credit for instituting the third gender option on citizenship certificates, but it is not implemented consistently, and it does not uphold the rights of people who identify as women and men.”

Human Rights Watch conducted the research for this report between August 2022 and December 2023. A researcher interviewed 18 transgender people and 1 intersex person who had attempted to change their legal gender or had not undertaken the process due to various barriers, as well as activists who help others undertake the legal gender recognition process, and government officials.

International human rights law and global medical standards of care support the complete separation of medical and legal processes with regard to gender transition. People seeking transition-related medical interventions should not face legal barriers, and people attempting to change their legal gender and name should not be required to undergo any medical procedures. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health, an international, multidisciplinary professional association, “opposes all medical requirements that act as barriers to those wishing to change legal sex or gender markers on documents.” The organization stated that “[m]edical and other barriers to gender recognition for transgender individuals may harm physical and mental health.”

The Yogyakarta Principles – drafted and signed in 2006 by a group of experts, including a former Nepal parliament member, Sunil Babu Pant – state that each person’s self-defined sexual orientation and gender identity is “integral to their personality” and is a basic aspect of identity, personal autonomy, dignity, and freedom. The principles are clear that gender recognition may involve, “if freely chosen, modification of bodily appearance or function by medical, surgical or other means.” Put simply, the process for legal recognition should be separate from any medical interventions. But if an individual’s personal transition process requires medical support, those services should be available and accessible.

Based on the Yogyakarta Principles, the Supreme Court in 2007 said that “self-feeling” is central to securing the rights of transgender people. Subsequent court decisions have further emphasized this principle. Nepal authorities should consistently apply this principle, and its application should not allow medical practitioners or bureaucrats to confirm or deny an applicant’s self-declared gender identity, Human Rights Watch said.

Nepal’s lack of a clear procedure for self-declaration of gender identity has led to decisions in individual cases based on government officials’ perceptions rather than the person’s “self-feeling.” Trans people who approach different administrative offices are given different advice and instructions, which sometimes contradicts what their peers are told for the same process elsewhere. One trans woman interviewed said: “The state just throwing in medical steps is a way they think they’re stabilizing something that was confusing, whereas we experience it as yet another barrier and yet another way in which we have to beg for our rights.”

“Forcing our community to undergo medical procedures that are expensive, unavailable, and in many cases unwanted by the individuals themselves, is a violation of our rights,” said Simran Sherchan, executive director at the Federation of Sexual and Gender Minorities-Nepal. “International consensus is that medical procedures for transitioning and legal procedures for transitioning need to be completely separated, and Nepal needs to make that clear.”",HIGH,20240215T064500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Manisha Dhakal, Rukshana Kapali, Simran Sherchan",Nepal Government,"Kathmandu, Nepal","Implement a clear, consistent, rights-respecting procedure for transgender individuals' legal gender recognition without medical prerequisites.","Lack of a clear, rights-respecting procedure for transgender individuals to obtain official documents in accordance with their gender identity.",Nepal,"Policy gaps, discriminatory practices, invasive medical procedures required for legal recognition"

These developments occur within a broader context of systematic attacks on political opponents and human rights defenders and erosion of civic freedoms.

On February 9, 2024, renowned human rights defender Rocio San Miguel was arbitrarily detained at Caracas Airport in Venezuela, while traveling with her daughter. Her detention follows a pattern of systematic arbitrary arrests and short-term enforced disappearances in the country. While the Attorney General acknowledged her detention, he failed to provide information on her whereabouts, despite efforts by her legal team to locate her. Some of San Miguel’s family members were also detained and later released. San Miguel and her ex-partner remain in detention, allegedly at the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service (SEBIN) and the General Directorate of Military Counterintelligence (DGCIM) headquarters, respectively. At the time of the publication of this statement, neither family members nor lawyers have been able to see them.

On 15 February, the Venezuelan government announced it was suspending the activities of the OHCHR, signaling a concerning escalation in the country’s attempts to evade international scrutiny and accountability. This decision came soon after the OHCHR expressed concern regarding the detention of San Miguel, noting that “her whereabouts remain unknown, potentially qualifying her detention as an enforced disappearance.” The announced suspension also took place a day after the publication of the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food’s report on his recent visit to Venezuela.

The OHCHR, including through its country presence in Caracas, has played an important role in monitoring and documenting the situation of human rights in the country and providing support and assistance to victims and survivors. The decision to suspend its presence therefore creates immediate protection gaps for individuals and communities at risk as the human rights situation is further deteriorating.

We strongly urge States, the UN Human Rights Council, and the broader international community to insist on the reestablishment of an effective OHCHR presence in the country and the release of all those arbitrarily detained for political reasons.

We also call upon the UN Human Rights Council to actively work towards the renewal of the mandate of the Fact-Finding Mission (FFM) in Venezuela in September 2024. The work of the FFM has been instrumental in investigating gross human rights violations and international crimes in Venezuela, some of which may amount to crimes against humanity, as well as identifying structural patterns and potential perpetrators of these crimes and violations. The FFM’s work, including through its public reporting mandate, remains essential to alert the international community of current patterns of repression and the risk of further deterioration. The FFM is also key to provide UN member States with recommendations on effective prevention and mitigation strategies in light of intensifying targeted persecution and system-wide repression.

Concerned governments and international actors, international organizations and justice mechanisms must remain steadfast in their commitment to uphold human rights in Venezuela, including during the upcoming session of the UN Human Rights Council.

(New York) – Indian authorities should urgently act to prevent further escalation in communal violence following the consecration of a controversial Hindu temple in Uttar Pradesh state on January 22, 2024, Human Rights Watch said today. Hindu processions that day led to sectarian clashes as well as incidents of vandalism, threats, and assault against Muslims and other religious minorities in several parts of the country.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who led the temple inauguration, had warned that those celebrating the temple should “show faith, not aggression.” However, as thousands of supporters of Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) joined cavalcades of vehicles across the country and shouted the slogan “Jai Shri Ram,” endorsing the god Ram, communal skirmishes broke out in a number of states including in Karnataka, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra , and Telangana.

“Prime Minister Modi’s explicit instructions against aggression often went unheeded, a casualty of violence emboldened by longstanding impunity, political patronage and protection,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Indian authorities need to take stronger action to end human rights abuses by Hindu militants.”

The most concerning incidents occurred in Maharashtra state, where a coalition government that includes the BJP took office in June 2022. In the Mira Road suburb of the state capital, Mumbai, arguments between Hindu men participating in a temple procession and Muslim residents soon flared into violence. The police arrested 13 men allegedly implicated in the violence.

Muslim witnesses said that in the evening before the temple inauguration, brawls broke out when Hindu mobs chanted slogans while brandishing sticks and swords in front of a mosque. When a militant Hindu mob returned to the same area on January 23, pelting stones and attacking shops, the police did little to control them. “The police are defending only one side,” Azeemuddin Sayed, a local social worker, told Human Rights Watch. “They should protect everyone. Or will they only protect based on religion?”

Abdul Haq Chaudhary said that the mob attacked his son and two workers, and damaged his vehicle. “They asked my son to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram,’ and when he refused, they started beating him,” Chaudhary said. He said that the mob attacked after they identified their vehicle as Muslim-owned as it had Islamic symbols. Chaudhary said he had filed a complaint, but the police had yet to make any arrests. “We have all the information. But the police are making excuses and saying they cannot spot anyone in the CCTV footage.”

After the Mira Road violence, the municipal authorities brought in bulldozers to demolish alleged illegal structures, most of them belonging to Muslims, that had been standing for decades. Local activists alleged that the government actions resulted in summary and collective punishment against Muslim residents.

Even as Prime Minister Modi declared on January 22 that the Ram temple was “a symbol of peace, patience, harmony and coordination in Indian society,” over a dozen instances of violent clashes were recorded across several Indian states. Many followed a similar pattern of young Hindu men displaying aggression, publicly brandishing sticks, swords, and in one case a gun. Violence did not escalate after the police intervened, showing that when ordered to do so, law enforcement can act in a rights-respecting manner, Human Rights Watch said.

A Muslim woman in Mumbai alleged that men chanting “Jai Shri Ram” harassed her on the streets. In Karnataka state, police arrested four men after a 17-year-old Dalit boy was assaulted and forced to say “Jai Shri Ram” for insulting Hindu gods because he had included a photo of the Dalit leader Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar on his WhatsApp status. Hindu mobs in Bihar celebrating the temple consecration allegedly set ablaze a Muslim cemetery.

In Uttar Pradesh, police arrested 11 people after the caretaker of a Mughal-era mosque in Agra complained that members of a Hindu procession forcibly placed saffron flags – symbolic of Hinduism – on the structure. In the state’s Sant Kabir Nagar district, police arrested five local residents who allegedly tried to enter a mosque twice while celebrating the temple consecration in a procession on January 22. In Telangana state, Muslim residents filed a police complaint after members of a Hindu procession allegedly threw shoes and papers at a mosque.

In some places, the violence followed confrontations between local Muslim and Hindu residents. In Gujarat, some threw stones when members of a Hindu procession lit firecrackers and played loud music in a Muslim neighborhood. In Telangana’s Sangareddy district, mobs set a shop on fire after an argument in which someone threw a shoe at the Hindu procession. In Panvel, Maharashtra, a scuffle ensued in a Muslim-dominated neighborhood after local residents confronted men chanting “Jai Shri Ram.” In Nagpur district, a brawl ensued between local Muslim residents and Hindu men celebrating the consecration. A communal clash in West Bengal on January 24 left at least 14 people injured.

The consecration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya is widely seen as a culmination of Hindu majoritarian and political demands led by the ruling BJP and its affiliates. The temple was constructed around the site where the 16th century Babri Mosque stood until a Hindu mob demolished it in 1992. Many Hindus believe that the mosque had been built on the ruins of a previous temple marking the birthplace of the Hindu god Ram. Thousands died in religious clashes and riots across the country following the demolition.

Secular and liberal groups in India organized screenings of documentaries during the temple inauguration to recall the brutalities that had marked the campaign for its construction. Both the authorities and Hindu groups targeted the screenings. In Hyderabad, three people were arrested after members of a Hindu group filed a complaint and allegedly vandalized the screening, accusing its organizers of “creating a communal issue.”

In Kerala, a Hindu mob threatened students of KR Narayanan National Institute of Visual Arts and Sciences, and disrupted the screening of the same documentary on the evening of January 22. In Pune, several men chanting slogans entered the Film and Television Institute of India to protest the screening of a documentary criticizing the Ram temple movement, vandalized the premises, and attacked students.

The authorities should act immediately to stem the deteriorating human rights situation in the country, particularly for freedoms of religion, expression, and association, Human Rights Watch said. Ahead of elections slated for this year, it is crucial to address rising fears of violence and discrimination against India’s Muslims and other religious minorities.

“A political campaign that enables violent triumphalism harms governance, rule of law, and India’s reputation as a democracy,” Pearson said. “The authorities need to ensure that the law is enforced impartially, and not to the benefit of the ruling party’s supporters.”",HIGH,20240131T053000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Elaine Pearson",Indian authorities and Hindu nationalist groups,"Ayodhya and various states including Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra, Telangana","Urgent action to protect minority rights and prevent further violence, impartial law enforcement",Failure to prevent communal violence and protect minority rights following the temple inauguration,India,"Longstanding impunity for Hindu nationalist groups, political patronage for violence"

International attention has focused in recent weeks on the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague, as the United Nations’ highest judicial body heard South Africa ’s case alleging that Israel is violating the 1948 Genocide Convention in Gaza. While a decision on the merits will likely take years, on January 26 the court issued provisional measures that include requiring Israel to prevent genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.

The case is one of several human rights-based claims before the ICJ. One group looking on with great interest is Afghan women, both inside the country and in the diaspora.

The ICJ is mainly responsible for settling disputes between states over matters of international law. Some of its recent cases have concerned human rights. In November 2019, Gambia brought a case under the Genocide Convention against Myanmar regarding alleged genocide against ethnic Rohingya. In June 2023, the Netherlands and Canada filed a case against Syria alleging it is violating the UN Convention Against Torture.

Since taking power in Afghanistan in August 2021, the Taliban have imposed a brutal crackdown on women and girls, violating rights in every aspect of their lives, including their ability to study, work, live free from violence, access health care, participate in public life, move freely, or even just walk in the park. These abuses continue to escalate and are blatant violations of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which Afghanistan ratified in 2003. CEDAW allows states that are parties to the treaty to bring to the ICJ disputes with other states parties “concerning the interpretation or the application” of the convention not settled by negotiation or arbitration.

Many governments around the world have denounced the Taliban’s full-scale attack on the rights of women and girls. While the International Criminal Court is investigating Taliban atrocity crimes, the ICJ offers governments that have expressed their solidarity with Afghan women another practical way to put Taliban abuses under judicial scrutiny – one which, as illustrated in other recent cases, can produce measures that could have a positive impact.

Afghan women and girls deserve their day in court against the Taliban, and the ICJ could play an important role. The support of just one state party to CEDAW could make that happen.",HIGH,20240131T053000Z,Afghan women,,Taliban,Afghanistan,Support initiatives to bring Taliban abuses to ICJ and enforce CEDAW provisions.,Violations of women's rights under Taliban rule,Afghanistan,"Taliban takeover, systemic gender discrimination"

Today, United States Senator Ben Cardin introduced the Human Rights Defenders Protection Act of 2024, which aims to protect individuals abroad “who face reprisals for defending human rights and democracy.” The law, if enacted, would strengthen the US government’s ability to “prevent, mitigate, and respond” to such cases.

Senator Cardin said this legislation “will help elevate, guide, and enhance US efforts to support these courageous individuals globally at a time when their efforts are more important than ever.”

The bill would integrate support for rights defenders into various US policies and programs and encourage engagement with the private sector. It aims to improve assistance for rights defenders living in exile from their home countries and strengthen US tools to hold perpetrators of rights abuses accountable.

Human Rights Watch has long documented the risks, threats, and attacks that rights defenders across the globe face. In Rwanda, for example, the government for many years has targeted with impunity rights defenders at home and extended its repression beyond its borders to silence Rwandan critics living abroad. Last December, the Emirati government brought new charges under its counterterrorism law against 87 activists and dissidents, including imprisoned rights defender Ahmed Mansoor.

The proposed legislation would create a new US visa for rights defenders who face a “credible fear of an urgent threat,” allowing those who qualify to reach safety before they are detained or harmed. It would also increase the number of US government personnel dedicated to democracy and human rights issues in the federal government and at embassies in countries with a high risk of rights abuses.

If passed, the legislation would require the US government to establish a “Global Strategy for Human Rights Defenders.” The strategy would survey current tools and resources to support human rights, identify how the government would prioritize and bolster protections for rights defenders, and establish specific goals for implementing the legislation’s policy objectives.

Human Rights Watch urges members of Congress to support passage of the bill. The law would tangibly recognize the work of human rights defenders abroad who frequently put their lives on the line to promote and protect human rights and would establish bold new policies to provide them a measure of security in the face of persecution.",HIGH,20240201T003000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Senator Ben Cardin, Ahmed Mansoor",Rwandan government and Emirati government,Rwanda and UAE,Support passage of the Human Rights Defenders Protection Act of 2024,Repression and persecution of human rights defenders,United States,"Political repression, government crackdown on dissent"

Introduction

Human Rights Watch welcomes the opportunity to provide input to the United Nations Human Rights Committee (the “Committee”) ahead of its upcoming review of Indonesia. This submission draws primarily on Human Rights Watch’s research on the situation of people with disabilities at home as well as in faith-healing centers, residential care institutions, and psychiatric hospitals across Indonesia from 2014 to 2020. It proposes issues and questions that Committee members may wish to raise with the government of Indonesia. We hope it will inform the Human Rights Committee’s assessment of the Indonesian government’s compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).

In 2016, Human Rights Watch published a 74-page report, “Living in Hell: Abuses against People with Psychosocial Disabilities in Indonesia , ” documenting abuses faced by people with disabilities, including children, in Indonesia, including stigma, arbitrary and prolonged detention, involuntary treatment, chaining or shackling, physical and sexual violence, as well as forced contraception. At the time, Human Rights Watch documented 175 cases of shackling and obtained evidence of another 200 documented cases.

In 2018, following additional research, Human Rights Watch published an updated report, “Indonesia: Shackling Reduced, but Persists , ” noting the positive steps taken by the Indonesian government to tackle shackling. The Indonesian government rolled out a nationwide outreach program to collect data, raise awareness, and provide community-based services, including mental health care.

A 2020 Human Rights Watch global report, “Living in Chains: Shackling of People with Psychosocial Disabilities Worldwide,” found that despite government efforts, the practice of chaining persisted in Indonesia and people with psychosocial disabilities continued to be arbitrarily detained in psychiatric hospitals, residential care institutions, and faith-healing centers where they face abuse.

Right to Equality and Non-discrimination (art. 2)

The 1945 Constitution of Indonesia guarantees fundamental rights to all its citizens. Although the constitution does not explicitly refer to persons with disabilities, it lays the foundation for other disability rights laws and provides the legal basis against discrimination.[1]

Indonesia’s Mental Health Act (MHA) of 2014 contains provisions for reducing stigma and bias against persons with psychosocial disabilities, and accountability for abuses including pasung (meaning to “tie” or “bind”).[2] Problematically, however, the law adopts a pejorative view of persons with psychosocial disabilities as people who have “obstacles in carrying out the functions of the human being,” who as such may be subjected to “coercive” rehabilitation.[3] It allows them to be stripped of legal capacity, without due process, including the right to make their own medical decisions.[4] Both of these provisions often lead to abusive treatment.

Shackling of Persons with Psychosocial Disabilities (arts. 7, 9, 10, 12)

In Indonesia, the widespread practice of pasung refers to the physical restraint of persons with real or perceived psychosocial disabilities, within the home or just outside.[5] Pasung is typically practiced by families who believe that the relative with the psychosocial disability is possessed by evil spirits, or are worried that the person might hurt themselves or others, or might run away. Pasung is also practiced by faith-healers in religious institutions as a form of punishment or “treatment” and by staff in care institutions. The continued practice and the government’s failure to take effective action constitutes serious violations of several rights found in the ICCPR.

Cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, involuntary medical treatment (art. 7, GC 20)

Pasung in Indonesia consists of chaining people or locking them in a room, shed, cage, or animal enclosure (including chicken coops, pig pens, and goat sheds) for periods ranging from hours to days, to years. The nature of shackling means people may not be able to stand or move at all, leading to long-term physiological damage and psychological trauma.

Research by Human Rights Watch globally has found that a person who is shackled can be affected by post-traumatic stress, malnutrition, infections, nerve damage, muscular atrophy, and cardiovascular problems.[6] In Indonesia, people who were shackled had no movement beyond the length of the chain – usually about two meters, having to bathe, defecate, urinate, and sleep within the radius where they were chained.[7]

Human Rights Watch met a 52-year-old woman with a psychosocial disability who was rescued by community health workers in Cijeruk, Bogor. “We locked her in her room for five years,” her sister said. “She would sleep on the floor; she couldn’t walk because her muscles had stopped working. We gave her a bucket to urinate and defecate in. It was very smelly. It made me very sad.” The family felt they had no alternative but to lock her up. But after a visit and help from outreach workers, her sister said, she was released and is now receiving support in the community.[8]

Pasung can also be a temporary measure that is used to restrain a person with a psychosocial disability for shorter time periods while the family goes out to work or when the person is having a crisis. In religious healing centers, it is used as a form of restraint, punishment, or “treatment.” In the case of private institutions and healing centers, the management may have an incentive to detain people as they are paid by the family. In many countries, including Indonesia, this is a profitable business.

In faith-healing centers, Human Rights Watch documented that persons with real or perceived psychosocial disabilities were routinely forced to take medication or alternative “treatments” (such as vigorous, painful massages and baths), without their consent.

Informed consent is a bedrock principle of medical ethics and international human rights law, and forcing individuals to take medicines without their knowledge or consent violates their rights.[9] The UN Special Rapporteur on torture has noted that “involuntary treatment and other psychiatric interventions in health-care facilities” can be forms of torture and ill-treatment.[10] In addition, the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women has condemned forced psychiatric treatment as a form of violence.[11] In her 2018 report, the UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities called on states to ensure that all health-related services “include a human rights-based approach to disability, are non-discriminatory, seek informed consent prior to any medical treatment, respect privacy and are free from torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.”[12]

Patients with psychosocial disabilities in government and privately run mental hospitals are also routinely forced to take medication, locked in isolation rooms, and subject to involuntary treatment ranging from physical and chemical restraints to unmodified electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).[13] Former UN Special Rapporteur on torture, Manfred Nowak, has noted that unmodified ECT (without anesthesia, muscle relaxants, and oxygen) is an unacceptable medical practice that may constitute torture or ill-treatment, as it may cause adverse effects such as cognitive deficits and loss of memory.[14]

Human Rights Watch documented 25 cases of physical violence including beatings and six cases of sexual violence, a lack of respect for privacy and dignity while bathing, and chaining children, women, and men close together – putting women and girls at risk of sexual violence.[15] Furthermore, Human Rights Watch documented 22 cases of forced seclusion, including of children, ranging from a few hours to over a month. In addition, in government as well as privately run residential care institutions, we found evidence of staff giving women contraception without their consent or knowledge.

Arbitrary detention, respect for inherent human dignity (arts. 9, 10, GC 8.1)

State-run residential institutions and private faith-healing centers where people with disabilities are arbitrarily detained are exceptionally overcrowded, unsanitary, and lack measures to support personal hygiene.[16]

Under Indonesian law, it is relatively easy to involuntarily admit a person with a psychosocial disability to an institution. The Mental Health Act (2014) allows a family member or guardian to admit a child or an adult with a psychosocial disability without their consent to a mental health or a social care institution, and without any judicial review. Human Rights Watch found 65 cases of people arbitrarily detained in mental hospitals, social care institutions, and nongovernmental organization-run or traditional or religious centers. None of those with psychosocial disabilities interviewed by Human Rights Watch who were living in institutions said that they were there voluntarily.[17]

In 2015, the UN Special Rapporteur on torture explicitly stated that shackling “unequivocally amount[s] to torture even if committed by non-State actors under conditions in which the State knows or ought to know about them.”[18] In her 2019 report, the UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities stressed that “States must protect persons with disabilities against home-based deprivation of liberty, including home confinement, shackling and pasung.”[19]

In 2022, following the initial report of Indonesia, the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities expressed concern “about deprivation of liberty on the basis of impairment, in particular for persons with psychosocial disabilities or intellectual disabilities” and explicitly referred to shackling, seclusion, and restraints as harmful practices.[20] The Committee called on the Indonesian government to “prohibit the use of shackling, seclusion and all forms of restraints in all settings, including within families and in social care institutions, and develop and promote non-coercive, community-based mental health supports and services.”[21]

Progress

Human Rights Watch’s 2018 follow-up report, “Indonesia: Shackling Reduced, But Persists , ” documents the important steps taken by the Indonesian government to end the practice of shackling people with psychosocial disabilities and expand community-based mental health services.

At the time, Human Rights Watch found that the number of people with psychosocial disabilities who were shackled or locked up in confined spaces had dropped from nearly 18,800 in 2016 to about 12,800 in July 2018, according to Indonesian government data.[22] The change resulted in part from a community outreach program to over 16.2 million households. Despite this progress, Human Rights Watch found that people with psychosocial disabilities continued to be detained arbitrarily in faith-healing centers, social care institutions, and mental hospitals.

Ratih, a woman with a psychosocial disability who had been detained for several years in the Yayasan Galuh Rehabilitation Center, a privately run institution on the outskirts of Jakarta, in Bekasi, said: “I have been chained here three times. The staff told me I was handcuffed for my own benefit. I got hit by the staff and was handcuffed for one whole week. I couldn’t even go to the toilet, I had to pee there, in my clothes. I had to ask my friend to help me eat but she was too scared [of the staff]…. I want to go home, I don’t belong here.”[23]

The Indonesian government officially banned pasung under law in 1977. However, the practice remains to this day. It is estimated that 57,000 people with psychosocial disabilities in Indonesia, including children, have been shackled at least once in their lives with approximately 15,000 still living in chains as of November 2019.[24] In many countries, including in Indonesia, Covid-19 disrupted basic services, leading to people being shackled for the very first time or returning to life in chains after having been released.

According to a 2023 media report, seven people with psychosocial disabilities who were shackled died over a three-months period on Flores Island.[25]

In 2023, the Indonesian Mental Health Association petitioned the Constitutional Court of Indonesia to review article 433 of the Civil Code to ban guardianship of people with psychosocial or intellectual disabilities. In July 2023, in an important step forward, the Constitutional Court partially granted the petitioners’ request by altering the nature of guardianship of people with disabilities from being mandatory to being optional.

Human Rights Watch encourages the Committee to ask the Indonesian government:

Is there official data on the number of people who are currently shackled in Indonesia?

What steps has the government taken to eliminate the practice of shackling of people with psychosocial disabilities?

How many children with psychosocial disabilities are currently arbitrarily detained in faith-healing centers, government-run as well as private residential care institutions, and psychiatric hospitals across Indonesia?

What steps has the government taken to end the arbitrary detention of people with psychosocial disabilities in psychiatric hospitals, residential care institutions, and faith-healing centers?

What concrete steps has the government taken to ban all forms of involuntary treatment, including ECT, without the person’s free and informed consent?

What steps has the government taken to develop adequate, quality, and voluntary community-based support and mental health services?

Human Rights Watch asks the Committee to consider including the following recommendations in its concluding observations on Indonesia:

Strengthen and monitor the implementation of laws banning pasung.

Recognize institutionalization based on the existence of a disability as a form of discrimination and without consent of the individual as a form of arbitrary detention.

Ban all forms of involuntary treatment, including ECT, without the person’s free and informed consent and in all circumstances involving children. Explicitly prohibit the use of seclusion and prolonged restraint. Define exceptional circumstances in which a patient may be considered temporarily unable to give free and informed consent and, in such circumstances, immediate medical treatment may be administered as it would be to any other patient without a disability incapable of consenting to treatment at that moment, provided that the treatment is strictly necessary to address a life-threatening condition or a condition of similar gravity.

Develop a time-bound plan to shift progressively to community-based mental health, support, and independent living services.

Create and implement a de-institutionalization policy and a time-bound action plan for de-institutionalization, based on the values of equality, independence, and inclusion for persons with disabilities.

Ensure that people who have been released from state and private institutions have access to psychosocial support and social services. Children should have access to child psychologists and special support services.

Progressively develop voluntary and accessible community-based mental health support services, in consultation with people with psychosocial disabilities and with the support of international donors and partners. This should include the development of psychosocial support services and integration of mental health services in the primary healthcare system.

Amend or repeal all domestic legislation that is contrary to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to ensure that persons with psychosocial or intellectual disabilities are guaranteed legal capacity, equal recognition before the law, supported decision-making as opposed to guardianship (plenary and limited), freedom from discrimination, and protection from arbitrary detention and treatment.

Conduct regular, unannounced monitoring visits to government and private social care institutions as well as faith-healing centers, with unhindered and confidential interaction with both staff and patients, and report publicly on the findings from these visits.

(Austin, February 1, 2024) – Increasingly extreme rhetoric from political leaders and escalations of Texas’ Operation Lone Star border deterrence program are increasing the risk to the lives and safety of immigrants and border residents alike, Human Rights Watch said today.

Earlier in January, three migrants, two of them children, drowned in the Rio Grande near Shelby Park, in the city of Eagle Pass, Texas. Days earlier, Texas officials had seized the park against the city’s wishes and prohibited federal agents from accessing the park, impeding rescue operations. The drownings and park seizure follow a statement by Texas Governor Greg Abbott on January 5 during a radio interview that the “only thing we're not doing is shooting people” because “the Biden Administration would charge us with murder.”

“Pushing people back into the river where there is razor wire and into more dangerous parts of the river while denying access to rescue people is unconscionable,” said Bob Libal, a Human Rights Watch consultant in Texas. “It risks more deaths and injuries.”

On January 22, the US Supreme Court ruled Texas cannot stop federal agents from cutting or removing razor wire that Texan authorities placed along the Rio Grande. However, Texas installed more razor wire at the border and Governor Abbott invoked Article 1, section 10, clause 3 of the US Constitution, asserting Texas’ right to self-defense when it is being invaded.

Video footage taken by the Dutch TV show EénVandaag in December 2023 shows Texas Military Department members using riot shields to push migrants back along the Rio Grande riverbank. The video also shows several migrants with deep cuts from the razor wire.

The US had previously asked courts to force Texas to remove saw-bladed buoy barriers installed in the river.

While there is no evidence Operation Lone Star has slowed migration, the program has led to injuries and deaths, consistently violated the rights of migrants and US citizens, and suppressed freedoms of association and expression of groups providing basic aid in Texas, Human Rights Watch said.

Dangerous chases of vehicles thought to contain migrants under Operation Lone Star have led to crashes that killed at least 74 people and injured at least another 189 in a 29-month period, according to a Human Rights Watch report released in November 2023. The dead and injured included migrants and US citizens, including many bystanders.

Operation Lone Star has most likely strengthened illicit actors who profit from the heightened fears of migrants and the blocked or impeded opportunities for people to request asylum in the United States, which is their right under US law. Criminal cartels’ profits increase when migrants attempt to enter the US by traveling through remote and deadly terrain.

In December 2023, Governor Abbott signed three additional measures into law that are likely to harm migrants, asylum seekers, and communities in Texas.

One measure, SB 4, would allow state and local police to arrest migrants entering Texas between official border crossings and charge them with either improper entry, punishable up to a year in prison, or improper re-entry, punishable by 2 to 20 years in prison. The new law, which goes into effect in March, applies throughout Texas and is likely to increase racial profiling, clog state courts, and fill jails. It is also likely to distract police from other public safety work by requiring them to instead focus on arresting and prosecuting people seeking to rejoin family, find protection, or make a better life. Civil rights groups and the US federal government have challenged the measure on constitutional grounds.

Another measure creates a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison for people found guilty of smuggling or running a “stash house.” Human Rights Watch found that of the thousands booked for smuggling under Texas’ existing laws, the vast majority were young Texans. Nearly 80 percent of those booked for smuggling were US citizens, with a median age of 26. Almost 13 percent were 18 or 19.

Another law will more than double funding to continue border wall construction, adding $1.54 billion to an existing purse of nearly $1.5 billion to build 40 miles of barriers along Texas’ 1,200-mile border with Mexico. Texas has now spent or allocated almost $12 billion to Operation Lone Star.

“Operation Lone Star has ballooned into a nearly $12-billion multilayered state government program of unnecessarily harsh laws,” Libal said. “Make no mistake: Operation Lone Star risks lives and recklessly squanders public resources.”",VERY HIGH,20240201T191500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Greg Abbott, Bob Libal",Texas State Government,"Eagle Pass, Texas & Rio Grande",Reassess and halt Operation Lone Star; prioritize rights of migrants and public safety.,Human rights violations against migrants and border residents due to Operation Lone Star and related laws,United States,Increased anti-immigration rhetoric and policies

If so, then parts of your car could be made with forced labor from China. Let's explain how. The first thing you need to know is that factories in China make the most cars in the world . Major brands such as General Motors, Tesla, BYD, Toyota, and Volkswagen manufacture and sell cars in China. Factories in China are also increasingly exporting cars and car parts to global markets. So where does the forced labor come in? Well, almost 10 percent of the world’s aluminum, a key material for car making, is produced in the Xinjiang region of China. Xinjiang is home to the Uyghurs, a predominantly Muslim Turkic ethnic group whose culture and language are different from China’s majority Han population. The Chinese government has long repressed Uyghurs and in recent years committed crimes against humanity in Xinjiang. The government’s abuses include: An estimated one million arbitrary detentions.

an intrusive mass surveillance system

(and) cultural and religious persecution The Chinese government has also subjected Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslim communities to forced labor, both in detention centers and through labor transfer programs. Labor transfers relocate Uyghurs from their homes in rural areas to urban areas to work in factories. Teams of government officials go door-to-door to identify candidates for transfers. Human Rights Watch and other organizations analyzed hundreds of Chinese government and company documents available online, and found links between Xinjiang’s aluminum producers and labor transfers. Uyghurs fear detention or other sanctions if they refuse the transfers, so there’s little choice but to accept the jobs and relocate. Labor transfer workers frequently face ideological indoctrination and limits on their freedom of movement. So how could aluminum produced by forced labor end up in your car? Aluminum from Xinjiang is exported to other regions of China, where it is melted down again, enabling it to enter global supply chains undetected. And maybe into the car that you use. Car companies are aware of the Chinese government’s repression of Uyghurs and the risk of forced labor in their supply chain . But some c armakers have succumbed to Chinese government pressure to apply weaker human rights and responsible sourcing standards in their operations in China. Consumers should not have to buy or drive vehicles with links to grave abuses in Xinjiang. So, what can be done? When looking to buy a new car, consumers should ask manufacturers how they protect against links to human rights abuses, including forced labor in Xinjiang. Car companies should require their suppliers, in China and elsewhere, to prove the source of raw materials and show they are free from human rights violations. Countries should require companies to disclose their supply chains and prohibit the import of products containing parts or materials produced by forced labor. The cars we drive shouldn’t be made with forced labor.

(New York) – Global carmakers, including General Motors, Tesla, BYD, Toyota, and Volkswagen, are failing to minimize the risk of Uyghur forced labor being used in their aluminum supply chains, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today.



The 99-page report, “Asleep at the Wheel: Car Companies’ Complicity in Forced Labor in China,” finds that some carmakers have succumbed to Chinese government pressure to apply weaker human rights and responsible sourcing standards at their Chinese joint ventures than in their global operations, increasing the risk of exposure to forced labor in Xinjiang. Most have done too little to map their aluminum supply chains and identify links to forced labor.

“Car companies simply don’t know the extent of their links to forced labor in Xinjiang in their aluminum supply chains,” said Jim Wormington, senior researcher and advocate for corporate accountability at Human Rights Watch. “Consumers should know their cars might contain materials linked to forced labor or other abuses in Xinjiang.”

The link between Xinjiang, a region in northwestern China, the aluminum industry, and forced labor is the Chinese government-backed labor transfer programs, which coerce Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims into jobs in Xinjiang and other regions.



Human Rights Watch reviewed online Chinese state media articles, company reports, and government statements and found credible evidence that aluminum producers in Xinjiang are participating in labor transfers. Human Rights Watch also uncovered evidence that fossil fuel companies that supply coal to aluminum producers in Xinjiang have received labor transfer workers at their coal mines. Xinjiang’s aluminum smelters depend on the region’s abundant and highly polluting coal supplies to fuel the energy-intensive process of aluminum production.



In 2023, domestic and foreign manufacturers in China produced and exported more cars than any other country. Since 2017, the Chinese government has committed crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, including arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, and cultural and religious persecution, and has subjected Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslim communities to forced labor inside and outside Xinjiang.



The Chinese government has sought to make Xinjiang an industrial hub even as it expanded abuses against Uyghurs. Xinjiang’s aluminum production has grown from approximately one million tons in 2010 to six million tons in 2022. More than 15 percent of the aluminum produced in China, or 9 percent of global supply, now comes from the region. Aluminum is used in dozens of automotive parts, from engine blocks and vehicle frames to wheels and electric battery foils, which are both used by manufacturers in China and exported to global carmakers.



Most of Xinjiang’s aluminum is shipped out of the region and mixed with other metals to make aluminum alloys in other parts of China, including for the car industry. Once an aluminum ingot has been melted and mixed with other materials, it is impossible to determine whether or how much of it came from Xinjiang, enabling tainted aluminum to enter domestic and global supply chains undetected.



Aluminum ingots from Xinjiang are bought and sold by commodities traders, further obscuring the links between Xinjiang and supply chains. Glencore, a global commodities trader, told Human Rights Watch it purchases aluminum from a Xinjiang-based smelter for sale to domestic customers in China but stated that “we recognize the risks of forced labor associated with Xinjiang” and said it had conducted due diligence at the supplier’s facilities in Xinjiang.



Car companies have a responsibility under the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights to identify, prevent, and mitigate the presence of forced labor and other human rights abuses in their supply chains. The high level of repression and surveillance in Xinjiang, including threats to workers and auditors, makes it impossible for companies to credibly investigate allegations of forced labor and consider potential remediation. Car companies should instead map their supply chains and disengage from any supplier found to source parts or materials from Xinjiang.



Some carmakers contend that because they do not operate or control their Chinese joint ventures, they are less able to address the joint ventures’ supply chain links to Xinjiang. Volkswagen, which holds 50 percent of the equity in its joint venture with SAIC, a Chinese carmaker, told Human Rights Watch it is not legally responsible for human rights impacts in their joint venture’s supply chain under Germany’s supply chain law because the law only covers subsidiaries in which companies have “decisive influence.”



German government guidance, however, sets out a range of criteria for determining whether a company has “decisive influence,” including “whether the subsidiary manufactures and exploits the same products or provides the same services as the parent company.” SAIC-Volkswagen manufactures cars for the Chinese market under the Volkswagen brand. The law also applies to Volkswagen’s direct suppliers, which could include SAIC-Volkswagen.



Companies in joint ventures also have a responsibility under the UN Guiding Principles to use their leverage to address the risk of forced labor in the joint venture’s supply chain. Volkswagen said that the company “assumes responsibility … to use its leverage over its Chinese joint ventures to address the risk of human rights abuses.” But when asked about potential links between SAIC-Volkswagen and an aluminum producer in Xinjiang, Volkswagen responded: “We have no transparency about the supplier relationships of the non-controlled shareholding SAIC-Volkswagen.” Volkswagen did say that its directly controlled operations outside China had prioritized supply chain mapping for aluminum parts, but acknowledged it had “blind spots” over the origin of the aluminum in its cars.



General Motors, Toyota, and the Chinese car company BYD did not respond to questions about oversight of Chinese joint ventures, supply chain mapping, or the origin of their aluminum. General Motors instead said, “GM is committed to conducting due diligence and working collaboratively with industry partners, stakeholders, and organizations to address any potential risks related to forced labor in our supply chain.”



Tesla, which builds cars for China’s domestic market and for export at its Shanghai Gigafactory, said that it had “in several cases” mapped its aluminum supply chain and had not found evidence of forced labor. However, the company did not specify how much of the aluminum in its cars remains of unknown origin.



Car industry staff and responsible sourcing experts, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the threat of Chinese government retaliation deterred companies from talking to their China-based suppliers and joint ventures about their potential links to forced labor in Xinjiang. The Chinese government has initiated criminal investigations targeting companies or individuals that help businesses investigate their potential links to human rights abuses in China, including forced labor in Xinjiang.



The Chinese government’s hostility to scrutiny underscores the need for other governments to pay more attention to companies’ respect for human rights in China. Several jurisdictions, including the United States and the European Union, have enacted or are planning laws banning the import of products linked to forced labor. Governments should also pass laws requiring companies to disclose their supply chains and identify potential links to human rights abuses.



“China is a dominant player in the global car industry and governments need to ensure that companies building cars or sourcing parts in China are not tainted by the government’s repression in Xinjiang,” Wormington said. “Doing business in China should not mean having to use or benefit from forced labor.”",VERY HIGH,20240201T094500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Jim Wormington, Human Rights Watch","Car manufacturers including General Motors, Tesla, BYD, Toyota, and Volkswagen","Xinjiang, China",Car companies must prove source of raw materials; governments to require supply chain disclosure,Complicity in forced labor in aluminum supply chains linked to Uyghur oppression,China,Chinese government repression of Uyghurs; push to develop Xinjiang as an industrial hub

(São Paulo) – The administration of Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva should rally legislators to approve the Escazú Agreement, more than 150 Brazilian and international organizations said today in a letter to Institutional Relations Minister Alexandre Padilha. The regional agreement protects the rights of access to information and to justice, as well as public participation in decision-making processes on environmental matters, and contains specific provisions for protecting environmental human rights defenders.

The letter's signatories include organizations working with communities affected by environmental destruction and associated violence; groups working on environment, Indigenous rights, transparency, access to information, and human rights; and academic institutions.

“The Lula administration took a very important step by sending the Escazú Agreement to Congress for approval last year,” said Andrea Carvalho, Brazil researcher at Human Rights Watch. “It now needs to engage lawmakers to ensure approval of a treaty that would further the government’s stated goal of protecting Brazil’s forests and taking a leading international role in fighting climate change.”

In March 2018, 24 Latin American and Caribbean states adopted the Regional Agreement on Access to Information, Public Participation, Justice in Environmental Matters in Latin American and the Caribbean, also known as the Escazú Agreement. Brazil signed the treaty that year but took no further action on it until May 2023, when President Lula finally sent it to legislators for ratification. Congressional approval is still pending. The agreement is currently under consideration by the foreign affairs committee in the Chamber of Deputies.

The agreement guarantees everyone’s right to access environmental information, such as on environmental risks and environmental protection, as well as to meaningfully participate in decision-making processes that affect their lives and the environment. It also requires countries to ensure adequate access to justice when those rights are violated, adopt measures to provide environmental defenders with a safe and enabling environment “so that they are able to act free from threat, restriction and insecurity,” and hold accountable anyone who threatens or commits acts of violence and intimidation against them.

The agreement is particularly relevant to countries like Brazil, where environmental and land defenders face threats and attacks. Human Rights Watch has documented the plight of communities in the Amazon trying to hold on to their land and protect the environment and their livelihoods from the onslaught of criminal networks involved in illegal logging, mining, and land grabs. The perpetrators of these acts of violence are rarely brought to justice.

Between April 22 and 24, the 15 countries that have ratified the Escazú Agreement will gather in Santiago, Chile, for the third Conference of the Parties (COP3). The Lula administration should send high-level officials as observers to show that Brazil is eager to join their efforts to protect the environment and those standing up to defend it across the region, Human Rights Watch said.

“Approving the Escazú Agreement should not be a partisan issue,” said Joara Marchezini, project coordinator at Nupef Institute and member of the Escazú Brazil Movement. “The agreement would benefit everyone by fostering government transparency, access to information, and stronger protection for Brazil’s natural heritage and its defenders. All parties in Congress should support it.”",HIGH,20240326T050000Z,over 150 Brazilian and international organizations,"Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Alexandre Padilha, Andrea Carvalho, Joara Marchezini",Brazilian government,Brazil,"Approve the Escazú Agreement, engage lawmakers to support it",Failure to approve the Escazú Agreement,Brazil,"Environmental destruction, violence against defenders, lack of political will"

(Washington, DC) - A new executive branch resolution broadening the scope for security agents’ use of firearms in Argentina runs counter to basic human rights standards and opens the door to abuse, Human Rights Watch said today.

On March 14, 2024, Security Minister Patricia Bullrich approved the resolution citing increased gang violence in the city of Rosario, Santa Fe province, which Human Rights Watch visited in late February. The resolution contains loopholes and ambiguities that could allow security officers to employ firearms in an unacceptably broad set of circumstances. It applies to all national security forces, including the national police and the national penitentiary service.

“People in Rosario and elsewhere in Argentina should be able to go about their daily lives without fear due to insecurity,” said Juanita Goebertus, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. “To achieve that, the government should be strengthening judicial capacity and preventing gang recruitment, not opening the door to excessive use of force.”

The resolution is an extended version of another resolution that Bullrich passed in 2018, when she was also Security Minister. Human Rights Watch had called for its modification as it ran counter to international human rights standards.

Rosario is the urban center with the highest rate of homicides in Argentina, five times higher than the average national rate. Its location, on the banks of a key waterway for regional trade and connected by land to Paraguay and Bolivia, makes it strategic for drug trafficking. For more than a decade, various local gangs have fought over control of the local drug trade. In the first two weeks of March, two taxi drivers, a bus driver, and a gas station employee were killed. Some analysts say the killings were possibly a countermove by gangs against the authorities’ measures to exert greater control in prisons.

When Human Rights Watch visited Rosario, provincial and municipal authorities, as well as judges, prosecutors, and experts on gang violence, emphasized the importance of strengthening judicial and prosecutorial capacities to investigate crimes by local gangs, their financing, and their connections with corrupt politicians. They also cited the need to prevent gang recruitment by improving education and job opportunities.

The resolution’s vague language is inconsistent with human rights standards that limit the use of firearms, Human Rights Watch said.

The resolution fails to distinguish between the use of firearms and the deliberately lethal use of firearms—that is, the distinction between shooting and shooting with the intent to kill. This is a key distinction because, even in those limited cases in which the use of firearms is justifiable, officers should generally not shoot to kill. Under the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, which the resolution cites but to which it fails to adhere, the intentional lethal use of firearms is permissible only “when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life.”

Moreover, the resolution allows federal security officers to use firearms when “non-violent means are ineffective,” without specifying that there are other means that should be employed before using firearms.

Under the UN Basic Principles, security officers may only employ firearms when “less extreme means,” including both non-violent and violent ones, are insufficient. This key provision recognizes that firearms are more likely to cause death or injury than other uses of force. Security forces may only use firearms when less lethal modes of force and non-violent means remain ineffective or without any promise of achieving the intended result.

The resolution undermines both administrative and judicial accountability for the use of firearms by security forces, Human Rights Watch said.

It provides that authorities cannot adopt “precautionary nor disciplinary measures” against an official “credibly” believed to have complied with the resolution, unless and until courts have issued a final criminal decision otherwise. This would make it impossible for authorities to discipline officers unless they have been convicted of a crime. It also eliminates the requirement, established in the 2018 resolution, that security forces “rapidly” prepare an administrative report after an officer uses a firearm causing injuries or death.

In a separate step, the Justice Ministry decided to carry out, starting in May, an adversarial system in criminal proceedings in the federal court system in Rosario, as part of a developing implementation of the system throughout the country. If effectively put in place, this change has the potential to accelerate criminal cases and more clearly distinguish between the functions of judges and prosecutors. However, authorities at the Attorney General’s Office and the Justice Ministry told Human Rights Watch that there were few, if any, additional resources available to implement the new system.

The administration of President Javier Milei should ensure adequate funding, resources, and training to ensure rights-respecting and effective investigations under the new system, Human Rights Watch said.",HIGH,20240325T170000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Security Minister Patricia Bullrich, Juanita Goebertus (Americas director at Human Rights Watch)",Argentine government/security forces,"Rosario, Santa Fe province, Argentina","Strengthen judicial and prosecutorial capacities, enhance education and job opportunities, ensure rights-respecting investigations",Broadening the scope for security agents’ use of firearms runs counter to human rights standards and opens the door to abuse,Argentina,"Gang violence, lack of judicial capacity, poor socio-economic conditions"

This submission focuses on ill-treatment in government-run detention centers, corporal punishment, the right to education, unregistered marriages, and the repatriation and reintegration of Iraqi children detained in northeast Syria.

Ill-Treatment in Government-Run Detention Centers (articles 2, 3, 19, 24, 27, 28, 37, 39, and 40)

Government authorities detain children in overcrowded, unsanitary, and in some cases inhumane conditions.[1] A source within the prison system shared with Human Rights Watch in 2019 evidence including photos of overcrowded prison cells in Nineveh, from earlier that year, holding children and women on charges of Islamic State (ISIS) affiliation in conditions so degrading that they amounted to ill-treatment.[2]

In federal Iraq, children are sometimes detained with adults in severely overcrowded and unsanitary conditions, with no access to education, rehabilitation, or contact with their families. As of early 2023, an estimated 100 children were being held with their mothers, many of whom are foreign nationals who have been charged with terrorism-related offenses, at Rusafa prison in Baghdad.[3] Children held in the Reformatory for Women and Children in Erbil report better conditions, including good food and separation from adult detainees. However, as of 2019, children suspected of ISIS association received no education, were confined to their rooms for up to 48 hours at a time, and were denied phone calls with their families during pretrial detention. Some also reported that reformatory guards beat them for perceived misbehavior. Human Rights Watch estimates that at the end of 2018, Iraqi and Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) authorities were detaining approximately 1,500 children for alleged ISIS affiliation. Many experienced horrific torture at the hands of detention center authorities.[4]

Detention authorities also ill-treat lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people.[5] In eight cases documented by Human Rights Watch in 2021, abuses by armed groups and state actors, including arbitrary arrest and sexual violence, were against children as young as 15 at the time.

Human Rights Watch encourages the Committee to call on the government of Iraq to:

Set up a National Preventative Mechanism for the prevention of torture and ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture.

Ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure.

Ensure that the treatment of children who committed criminal acts as members of ISIS are in line with international children’s rights standards, including that detention is used only as a last resort and for the shortest period of time and that children are not detained with unrelated adults, and that measures are primarily targeted towards their rehabilitation and reintegration.

Review detention center policies and procedures to ensure that detainees are moved to facilities that are equipped to meet basic international standards and are accessible to government inspection, and with regular access by independent monitors and relatives.

Take all appropriate measures to end torture and other ill-treatment, summary killings, and other abuses, including those based on sexual orientation and gender expression and identity, and compensate all families of victims of unlawful killings and survivors of serious abuse.

Investigate all credible allegations of torture and other detention-related abuses, dismiss any and all evidence, including confessions, obtained by torture, and punish those deemed responsible appropriately.

Corporal Punishment (articles 19, 24, and 28)

On December 10, 2018, a 9-year-old boy in Erbil died after being hit in the head by his teacher.[6] In Iraq, corporal punishment remains lawful. The Penal Code provides a defense to criminal liability for “the disciplining by parents and teachers of children under their authority within certain limits prescribed by law or by custom,”[7] but Iraq’s 2005 Constitution states that “all forms of violence and abuse in the family, school and society shall be prohibited.”[8] The 2018 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey found that almost 60 percent of children aged 1-14 were exposed to corporal punishment, and 31 percent to severe physical punishment (such as hitting or slapping on the face, head, or ears).[9] 18 percent of caregivers believed that physical punishment is necessary.[10]

Human Rights Watch encourages the Committee to:

Ask the government of Iraq how recent cases of corporal punishment have been monitored and reported, and to provide recent data on the prevalence of violent discipline in schools.

Call on the government of Iraq to ensure that all forms of violent discipline in all settings, including in the home, are explicitly prohibited.

Right to Education (article 28)

Access to education during the Covid-19 pandemic

From March 2020 to March 2022, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, Iraqi schools were fully closed for 51 weeks and only partially open for 27 weeks.[11] While the government transitioned to various forms of distance learning, Human Rights Watch found several barriers to accessing education, including the compounding effects of armed conflict and new education costs.[12]

For example, in northern Iraq, a father told Human Rights Watch in June 2020 that none of his five children, aged between 8 and 15, had received any education since schools closed in February that year.[13] In Erbil, a teacher at a school for families who fled ISIS in 2014 and had not returned to their areas of origin “due to the mass destruction of infrastructure, including schools,” said many of her students’ families are poor. As a result, even though the Kurdistan Region’s education ministry started online education, “it is hard to cater for all the students, because not all of them are connected to the internet. They cannot afford internet costs.”[14] The teacher also said her school did not provide her equipment or financial assistance for online teaching. “I did not have internet prior to the school shutdown, and I was forced to adapt and try to get internet using 3G data on my phone… The connection is not reliable. I do not have unlimited access and I have to pay for the data that I use.”[15]

Human Rights Watch recommends that the Committee:

Ask the Iraqi government how the extent of children’s learning loss due to Covid-19 school closures has been assessed, and what measures have been taken to remedy lost learning.

Call on the government to strategically allocate educational resources to marginalized and low-income groups and those shown to have been particularly affected in their education during the pandemic.

Call on the government to adopt measures to provide affordable, reliable, quality, and accessible internet, including targeted measures to provide free, equitable access to the internet for educational content, as well as to develop or expand device affordability and availability initiatives for schools and families. This should be carried out to the extent that online learning is used beyond Covid-19 school closures and in a manner that protects children’s privacy online.

Commend the government of Iraq for providing two years of free pre-primary and free secondary education under its domestic law.

Protection of education from attack

The Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack (GCPEA) identified at least 17 reports of attacks on schools in Iraq between 2020 and 2023.[16] Reported attacks also occurred sporadically in 2018 and 2019.[17] Many of the incidents involved improvised explosive devices (IEDs) placed in or near schools. Between 2020 and 2023, GCPEA also collected at least 17 reported incidents of attacks on students, teachers, and other education personnel, occurring in both the contexts of conflict violence and protest repression. It also identified over 75 incidents of military use of schools and universities.[18]

Iraq endorsed the Safe Schools Declaration in May 2015.[19] The Safe Schools Declaration[20] is an inter-governmental political commitment that provides countries the opportunity to express political support for the protection of students, teachers, and schools during times of armed conflict; the importance of the continuation of education during armed conflict; and the implementation of the Guidelines for Protecting Schools and Universities from Military Use during Armed Conflict. [21]

Human Rights Watch encourages the Committee to:

Ask the government of Iraq whether protections for schools from military use are included in any policies, rules, or trainings for Iraq’s armed forces.

Recommend that the government incorporate the Safe Schools Declaration’s standards in domestic policy, military operational frameworks, and legislation, and share any good practices with other countries in the region.

Recommend that the government impartially and systematically investigate attacks on students, teachers, and schools, and appropriately prosecute those responsible.

Unregistered Marriages (articles 7, 8, 18, 24, 26, 28, and 34)

Each year, tens of thousands of Iraqi couples enter into unregistered marriages. These marriages are officiated by religious leaders and are culturally accepted as valid marriages; however, they are not legally valid until they are registered with the Personal Status Court and the couple is issued a civil marriage contract. Frequently, people opt for unregistered marriages to circumvent marriage requirements in the Personal Status Law, particularly restrictions on child marriage, forced marriage, and polygamy. In addition, Iraqis living in ISIS-controlled territory between 2014 and 2017 who married were also only issued marriage certificates by ISIS, which are not recognized by the Iraqi state.[22]

Child marriage

Human Rights Watch has found that in Iraq unregistered religious marriages are functioning as loopholes enabling child marriage.[23] In 2021, the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq reported that 22 percent of unregistered marriages involved girls under the age of 14.[24] Local partners told Human Rights Watch that they believe most unregistered marriages involved girls under 18. Over the last 20 years, rates of child marriage in Iraq have been steadily increasing.[25]

Iraq’s Personal Status Law sets the legal age for marriage at 18, or 15 with a judge’s permission, depending on the child’s “maturity and physical capacity.”[26] The consequences of child marriage for girls include increased risks of sexual and domestic violence, death during childbirth, mental health harms, and impeded access to education and employment.[27] Because of harmful gender norms, girls are frequently seen as economic burdens on a family, and marriage can be seen as a way to lift that burden, obtain a dowry, and perhaps secure their daughters’ future.[28] In Iraq, girls who are deprived of basic education are more likely to enter into child marriage and early childbearing.[29]

Access to public services and social protection

Iraq has discriminatory policies that link access to several public services and social protection schemes to an individual’s marital status. For example, girls and women are required to show proof that they are married to give birth in hospitals or access prenatal care. As a result, some are forced to opt for at-home births, increasing the risk of not having adequate medical support to address complications during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postnatal period. This risk is heightened in adolescent pregnancies.

Without a civil marriage contract, girls and women also have no legal protection or recourse to claim their rights to dowry, spousal maintenance, and inheritance in the event they are being denied it.[30] Article 57(1) of the Personal Status Law states that “the mother is more deserving of the custody and upbringing of the child, as long as the marriage is valid and after separation, unless the child in custody is harmed by this measure.” However, a condition is that the responsible parent has reached 18 years of age. Because religious marriages are often used to skirt domestic law on the legal age of marriage, affected girls may be trapped in abusive relationships for fear of losing their children.

Access to civil documentation

These barriers can also create negative downstream effects on the rights of children born into unregistered marriages. Under Iraq’s Birth and Death Registration Law of 1971, parents can only obtain birth certificates for babies born in wedlock, meaning children in unregistered marriages are unable to obtain any other identity document and are at risk of losing their legal identity or becoming stateless.[31]

Proof of paternity is also required to register a child’s birth. Iraqi law does not allow for the registration of a child under the name of just the mother, with the father’s identity listed as unknown or unspecified.[32] Thus, even though nationality can be passed from mother to child, single-parent families may still end up with stateless children. This problem additionally affects children born of rape and conflict-related sexual violence, whose mothers may not know or may not wish to disclose the identity of the father.

Without this crucial civil documentation, the child will be cut off from accessing most public services and social protection schemes in Iraq, including education, health care, employment, food distribution, housing, and social protection schemes.[33]

There are no provisions in Iraq’s Personal Status Law that punish religious leaders who officiate marriages outside the court and where such marriages are in violation of the law, enabling religious leaders to violate Iraqi law with impunity. It is possible to initiate prosecutions against religious leaders by using Article 240 of the Iraqi Penal Code, which punishes any person who contravenes an order issued by an official body. However, public prosecutors have never used this provision.

Human Rights Watch encourages the Committee to call on the government of Iraq to:

Adopt a national action plan to eliminate child marriage in Iraq and set the minimum age of marriage at 18 without exception.

Reform the relevant laws governing citizenship and birth registration to permit the registration of all births and the obtention of Iraqi citizenship and associated legal documents.

Amend the Penal Code and Personal Status Law to include punishments for religious leaders who officiate marriages in violation of the Personal Status Law.

Allow children without documents to enroll in school and obtain education certificates.

End all inquiries about the marital status of girls and women accessing health care and allow in-hospital births and prenatal care for all girls and women, regardless of their marital status.

Repatriation and reintegration of Iraqi children detained in northeast Syria (articles 3, 6, 9, 19, 24, 28, 37, and 39)

Several thousand Iraqis, most of them children, are detained in al-Hol and Roj, two locked, sprawling camps in northeast Syria primarily holding the wives, other adult female relatives, and children of male ISIS suspects. As of January 2024, they are among about 47,000 people from about 60 countries unlawfully detained in the camps, including more than 17,000 from Iraq.[34] Most of these detainees were rounded up in late 2018 or early 2019 by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) as they toppled the last remnant of ISIS’s self-declared caliphate in northeast Syria.

Iraq is to be commended for bringing home more than 10,000 Iraqis unlawfully detained as ISIS suspects and family members from northeast Syria – more than 7,000 from al-Hol camp, most of them women and children,[35] as well as up to 3,000 men and more than 200 boys who had been held in prisons.[36] Iraq has committed to repatriating the rest.

Nevertheless, Human Rights Watch is concerned about the deplorable conditions of detention for Iraqi nationals who have yet to be repatriated from northeast Syria. Although Iraq has increased efforts to assist returnees,[37] Human Rights Watch is concerned about inadequate shelter, including in detention centers for both adults and children, as well as insufficient food, water, healthcare, economic support, and other rehabilitation and reintegration assistance for those whom it has brought home.

Conditions for Iraqi Children Detained in Northeast Syria

Conditions in the camps and prisons in Northeast Syria are dire.[38] Health care, clean water, shelter, and education and recreation for children, are grossly inadequate. Mothers interviewed by Human Rights Watch said they hide their children in their tents to protect them from sexual predators, abusive camp guards, and ISIS recruiters and fighters.[39] Children have drowned in sewage pits,[40] died in tent fires,[41] and been hit and killed by water trucks,[42] and hundreds have died from treatable illnesses.[43] Some younger children attend informal preschool, but most children have no access to education and have missed out on years of schooling.

Conditions are even worse in the prisons and makeshift detention centers where the SDF is detaining approximately 10,000 from about 20 countries, including about 2,000 who are boys or who were apprehended before they turned 18.[44] Some boys were detained when they were as young as 12.[45] In the prisons, overcrowding initially was so severe that many of the detainees slept shoulder to shoulder.[46] Sources including aid groups estimate that hundreds of detained boys have tuberculosis that was untreated for well over a year, that many are malnourished, and that some need specialized surgery or advanced treatment for wounds or other medical conditions.[47] Although sources have told Human Rights Watch that all Iraqi boys who had been held without charge in prisons have been repatriated to Iraq, we have received conflicting accounts as to whether Iraq has yet brought home all Iraqi male detainees and if not, whether those who remain include young men who have been unlawfully imprisoned since they were children.

Human Rights Watch recommends that the Committee ask the Iraqi government:

What is the Iraqi government’s current timeline to finish repatriating all Iraqi nationals including children detained in northeast Syria as ISIS suspects or family members? Please include in your response your plans for men detained in prisons, as well as Iraqi men, women and children detained in Al-Hol and Roj camps.

How many Iraqi males remain detained in northeast Syria for suspected ISIS ties and how many of these men were boys (males under age 18) when they were first placed in detention in northeast Syria? Are any Iraqi boys still detained in prisons for suspected ISIS ties?

How many Iraqi boys who were repatriated from detention centers in northeast Syria are still detained in Iraqi prisons? What are the conditions of detention, including their access to water, medical care, education, recreation, and communication with family including visits? What is the level of humanitarian access for these boys? What are the government’s plans for them?

How many Iraqi men (males aged 18 and over) whom Iraq has repatriated from northeast Syria are detained in Iraqi prisons? How many of these men were children when they were initially placed in prisons for ISIS suspects and family members in northeast Syria? What are the conditions of detention, including their access to water, medical care, education, recreation, and communication with family including visits? What is the level of humanitarian access for these men? What are the government’s plans for them?

What are the conditions in Jeddah 1 camp? What steps are taken to ensure returnees temporarily placed in Jeddah 1 are prepared to return to their home communities before they go home, and what safeguards are in place to ensure these returns are safe and voluntary?

Human Rights Watch recommends that the Committee call on the Iraqi government to:

Continue the repatriations, as a matter of urgent priority, of all Iraqi nationals arbitrarily detained in northeast Syria, giving precedence to children and other particularly vulnerable citizens in both camps and other places of detention.

Provide returnees with rehabilitation and reintegration services, including medical and psychosocial support. Conduct individualized assessments to tailor assistance to each returnee’s particular circumstances, considering gender, age, educational needs, family situation, and cultural background.

Malian armed forces and Wagner Group foreign fighters unlawfully killed and summarily executed several dozen civilians in counterinsurgency operations in Mali’s central and northern regions since December.

Mali’s Russia-backed transitional military government is committing horrific abuses and is leaving the regional group that could provide scrutiny into its human rights situation.

The mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council’s independent expert on human rights in Mali, who assists the Malian government to protect human rights, should be renewed and given adequate resources.

(Nairobi) – Malian armed forces and Wagner Group foreign fighters have unlawfully killed and summarily executed several dozen civilians during counterinsurgency operations in Mali’s central and northern regions since December 2023, Human Rights Watch said today. Military drone strikes on a wedding celebration on February 16, 2024, and during a burial on February 17, 2024, killed at least 14 civilians, including 4 children.



Mali has long been engaged in an armed conflict with Islamist armed groups linked to Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. The recent abuses have occurred at a time when Mali’s relations with the United Nations and neighboring West African governments have sharply deteriorated. In December, the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), pulled out of the country at the request of Mali’s transitional military authorities, raising concerns about the protection of civilians and the monitoring of abuses. In January, the transitional authorities announced that Mali would leave the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which would deprive victims of gross human rights violations of the ability to seek justice through the ECOWAS Community Court of Justice.



“Mali’s Russia-backed transitional military government is not only committing horrific abuses, but it is working to eliminate scrutiny into its human rights situation,” said Ilaria Allegrozzi, senior Sahel researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The Malian authorities should urgently work with independent experts to monitor human rights violations and ensure that those responsible are held to account.”



Between January 1 and March 7, Human Rights Watch interviewed by telephone 31 people with knowledge of the incidents in central and northern Mali. These included 20 witnesses to abuses, as well as community leaders, activists, international organization representatives, journalists, and academics. On March 1, Human Rights Watch sent letters to Mali’s justice and defense ministers detailing its findings and inquiring about alleged abuses. The Malian authorities did not respond.



Witnesses reported serious abuses by the Malian armed forces and the Wagner Group, the Russia-linked military security contractor, during counterinsurgency operations against Islamist armed groups in the villages of Attara, in Timbuktu region; Dakka Sebbe and Nienanpela in Segou region; Dioura and Gatie Loumo in Mopti region; Ouro Fer, Nara region. They said that in most of the operations, foreign, non-French-speaking armed men described as “white” or “Wagner"" took part. In Dakka Sebbe, the operation was carried out almost entirely by Wagner fighters. In Attara, more Wagner fighters were identified than Malian soldiers.



Wagner personnel first deployed to Bamako, Mali’s capital, by December 2021 with support from the Russian armed forces. Human Rights Watch has previously documented grave abuses by Malian security forces and allied fighters believed to be from the Wagner Group. In August 2023, Russia vetoed a UN Security Council resolution that would have extended the work of the panel of experts tracking abuses by armed groups and Malian security forces and Wagner fighters, curbing efforts to bring accountability for conflict-related violations.



On January 26, scores of Malian soldiers searching for Islamist fighters in Ouro Fero village went door-to-door and arrested 25 people, including 4 children. Later that day, villagers found their bodies about four kilometers from Ouro Fero. “We found the bodies on a hill, charred, bound by the hands, and blindfolded,” said a 26-year-old villager who helped bury the bodies. “They had all been shot in the head.”



On February 16, a Malian drone strike on an outdoor wedding celebration in Konokassi killed at least five men and two boys and wounded three others. The following day, as villagers attempted to bury the bodies, a second drone strike hit a group of people at the Konokassi cemetery, killing five men and two boys and injuring six others. Villagers said that while the Al-Qaeda-linked Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims (Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wa al-Muslimeen, JNIM) controls the areas around Konakassi, none of their fighters were at the wedding.



Islamist armed groups have committed serious abuses in Mali for over a decade. They have summarily executed hundreds of people accused of collaborating with government forces; raped women and girls; planted indiscriminate improvised explosive devices; forced civilians into adhering to their version of Islam; looted and burned property; and denied civilians food and aid during sieges of cities and towns.



“Whatever we choose is bad, wherever we go is to face suffering,” said a man from Nienanpela village, where on January 23 Malian soldiers and Wagner fighters executed a 75-year-old man who was unable to flee. “The jihadists are brutal and have imposed their way of Islam on us, but the military and Wagner [fighters] who are supposed to protect us, what they do is only to kill, loot, and burn.”



Mamoudou Kassogué, Mali’s justice minister, told the UN Human Rights Council on February 28 that his government had “deployed major efforts to investigate allegations of human rights violations,” including those “made against security and defense forces.” He also promised that the National Directorate for Human Rights, a Justice Ministry body, would begin its work. The directorate was created in April 2023 to develop human rights-related policies and prevent human rights abuses by carrying out recommendations from human rights organizations, including the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC).



Malian human rights advocates expressed skepticism that the commission could be effective, since its head will report directly to the justice minister. “The NHRC is today the only independent human rights body left in the country, but it faces challenges,” said a prominent Malian human rights defender. “When MINUSMA was still around, the NHRC, human rights defenders, as well as victims and witnesses of abuse felt reassured. Now, few dare to speak out.”



The mandate of the UN independent expert on human rights in Mali, who assists the Malian government to promote and protect human rights, expires on April 4. The UN Human Rights Council should renew the independent expert’s mandate and ensure that their office has the resources it needs, Human Rights Watch said.



All parties to the armed conflict in Mali, including members of foreign armed groups, are bound by international humanitarian law. Applicable law includes Common Article 3 to the 1949 Geneva Conventions and customary international law. The laws of war prohibit the killing or ill-treatment of people in custody, attacks that do not discriminate between civilians and combatants, and the destruction or looting of civilian property, among other violations. Individuals who commit violations of the laws of war with criminal intent, that is deliberately or recklessly, are responsible for war crimes. Commanders who knew or should have known about abuses by their subordinates but did not prevent them or punish those responsible may be liable as a matter of command responsibility.



“The Malian army and Wagner Group fighters have shown deliberate cruelty against Malian civilians that should be investigated as war crimes,” Allegrozzi said. “Malian authorities should continue working with the National Human Rights Commission and the UN independent expert to gather evidence of serious abuses, ensure credible and impartial investigations, and bring those responsible to justice.”



For witness accounts and other details, please see below. The names of those interviewed have been withheld for their protection.



Malian Military Drone Strike



Konokassi, Segou region, February 16 and 17



On February 16 at about 3 p.m., a Malian drone bombed a wedding celebration in an open-air location in Konokassi, Segou region, three witnesses told Human Rights Watch. The attack killed at least five men and two boys, and wounded three other men. The following day, as villagers attempted to bury the bodies of those killed during the wedding, a second drone strike hit a group of people at the Konokassi cemetery killing five men and two boys, and injuring six other men.



Mali has acquired Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drones since 2022. These remotely piloted aerial combat vehicles can surveil, accurately target, and deliver up to four MAM-L laser-guided bombs.



A 57-year-old man who lost his 20-year-old son during the first strike said that they were sitting in three groups: the youth, friends of the groom, about 30 of them; and the adults, about 20 men and 10 elders. “When we saw the drone coming from the south, we did not bother too much because since November 2023, we are used to seeing this drone, it comes many times and flies over the village,” he said. “But this time, we suddenly heard a noise, like a whistle and then the big ‘boom!’ of the explosion.”



The JNIM Islamist armed group operates in the Segou region. However, witnesses said there were no Islamist fighters or any other armed men at the wedding. “There were no jihadists at the wedding,” the man said:



They are present in our area, but they do not mix with us, they are in the bush. They would never come to a civilian wedding … They don’t celebrate weddings. They ask the father for a girl’s hand. If he accepts, they pay [him] the dowry and it’s over; there is no party. If the father refuses, they might take the girl by force.

A 34-year-old man said:



The strike occurred at about 3 p.m. It’s because of the jihadists that we now celebrate weddings during the day. They have forbidden us to do it at night, as we used to do … They also do not want men and women to mix, that’s why that day, women were inside the house of the groom, while men and boys were celebrating the wedding outside.

Another 57-year-old man said:



The bomb struck the group of young people … We all ran away, even the wounded ran. There were three wounded: one with a broken arm; another wounded in the head; another with an injured shoulder. Looking at the wounds, they looked like blade wounds, very deep … We did not come back to the village until the following day.

Witnesses said that the following day, some villagers went back to Konokassi to bury the bodies of those killed at the wedding but were hit by a second drone strike.



The man who lost his son during the first strike said:



We found seven bodies, three of which were totally torn apart. We first buried the three on the spot, then we wrapped the other four in clothes and took them to the cemetery. We were digging the graves when we saw a drone coming, which looked like the one we saw the day before. It flew over us before dropping a bomb. We were shaken by the explosion. I fell and ran away. I was injured lightly in my back. We fled to the bush and late at night some of us, including myself, went back to the cemetery and counted seven more dead. We buried them in a hurry.

Human Rights Watch reviewed two lists of victims and wounded compiled by survivors and residents, with the names of 14 people killed and 9 injured in the two strikes. There are 10 names on the list of victims of the first strike: the dead included 5 men, ages 18 to 30, a 16-year-old boy and a 17-year-old boy, and the three injured were all men, ages 18 to 30. The list for the second strike included 13 names: the 7 fatalities were 5 men, ages 19 to 24, a 17-year-old boy and 14-year-old boy, and the 6 injured were all men, ages 22 to 61.



Radio France Internationale also reported the incident, stating that “a drone hit a wedding in Konokassi, in Mariko district. Six people were killed instantly. The next day, Saturday, the drone struck the same locality again during the burial of the previous day's victims. Six other people were killed. And several others injured.”



Abuses by Malian Armed Forces and Wagner Fighters



Ouro Fero (also known as Welingara), Nara Region, January 26



On January 26, scores of Malian soldiers carried out an operation in Ouro Fero village, searching for Islamist fighters, four witnesses said. During the operation, they went door-to-door and arrested 25 people, including 4 children. Later the same day, villagers found the charred bodies of the 25 people who were arrested about four kilometers from Ouro Fero. The JNIM armed group is known to operate in the area.



Witnesses said that the operation was a reprisal following an attack claimed by the JNIM, on the military base in Mourdiah, 18 kilometers from Ouro Fero, on December 25. A 26-year-old man from Ouro Fero said:



Following the attack on the military barracks in Mourdiah, we were expecting a violent response by the army. It’s always like this. Every time the jihadists attack the army, reprisals against civilians, especially ethnic Fulani, follow. The military accuses us of being accomplices to the jihadists while we just suffer their domination.

Witnesses said that the soldiers, who were coming from the Mourdiah military base, were armed with Kalashnikov-style assault rifles and wore camouflage uniforms, body armor, and helmets. They said the soldiers arrived from the east side of Ouro Fero at about 6 a.m. and surrounded the village while shooting in the air, which caused people to flee. A 56-year-old herder said:



I was awakened by shooting. I went outside, saw people running, and joined them. Once we arrived at the west side of the village, we realized that we could not continue because the military had surrounded the whole village. So, I returned home and hid on top of a shed, under some straw and grass … I saw two soldiers break into my home. I could hear them asking my wife: “Where is your husband?” She replied I wasn’t around … Before leaving, one of the two soldiers told my wife that they were conducting the operation to identify suspected Islamist fighters to take them to their camp in Mourdiah to interrogate them.

Witnesses said that at the end of the operation, at about 7 a.m., the soldiers arrested 21 men and 4 boys.



Witnesses said that later the same day, people from a nearby settlement, about four kilometers from Ouro Fero, informed them by telephone that they saw the military stop there with a group of people, then heard gunfire. A group of 12 villagers from Ouro Fero, including two Human Rights Watch interviewed, said they rushed to the site where they found the bodies of those arrested that day. The victims, witnesses said, were bound and blindfolded, and appeared to have been shot before being burned.



A man who found the bodies said:



Before finding the bodies, we found the place where the soldiers had searched the victims’ pockets. We found some identity cards and hats. Then, about 200 meters further, we found the bodies of all those arrested in the morning. Their hands were tied, their eyes blindfolded. They were shot, some in the head, before being burned … We buried them at about 5 p.m. We collected several stones and placed them around the bodies, then we poured sand on them and covered them with tree branches.

Human Rights Watch reviewed two lists compiled by survivors and Ouro Fero’s residents with 25 names of victims, including 21 men, ages 21 to 67, and 4 boys, ages 12 to 16.



On January 30, French media Radio France Internationale also reported on the killings in Ouro Fero, also mentioning the presence of Wagner fighters. On February 1, the UN high commissioner for human rights stated that he was “appalled by credible allegations that Malian armed forces accompanied by foreign military personnel summarily executed at least 25 people in the village of Welingara,” on January 26, and called for an “impartial investigation” to bring those responsible accountable.



On January 26, the chief of Ouro Fero sent a letter to the Malian defense minister, which Human Rights Watch reviewed, informing him of the army killings in his village and expressing his regret. He said that soldiers killed 25 people, including a man who could not see well and children, and that their bodies were burned.



Attara, Timbuktu Region, January 25



On January 25, the Malian armed forces and Wagner fighters carried out a military operation in Attara, a village on the banks of the Niger River, in an area where the JNIM is known to operate. They threatened villagers with death, summarily killed seven civilian men, and looted property, three witnesses said.



Witnesses said that soldiers and Wagner fighters came from Leré, a city about 65 kilometers from Attara.



A 57-year-old herder said:



Early in the morning, our relatives from Leré called to inform us that a convoy of more than 100 Malian military vehicles with Wagner [fighters] had left Leré and was heading in our direction. Given the abuses committed by Wagner [fighters], their movements are always monitored by villagers … We also received calls from other relatives as the convoy moved forward, passing through the villages of Dianke and Sambani. Our contacts told us that in Sambani, the convoy split into two groups, one heading toward Attara and the other toward Soumpi.

Soldiers based in Leré participated in “Operation Maliko,” which was created by a January 30, 2020 decree signed by then-President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta to “counter terrorist and criminal threats.” The operation falls under the direct command of the chief of the general staff of the Malian armed forces and is divided in geographic sectors. Credible sources told Human Rights Watch that the soldiers based in Leré operate under Sector 3, whose commander is Col. Seydou Niangadou.



Witnesses said that one of the convoys of about 50 military vehicles, including armored vehicles and pickup trucks carrying soldiers and Wagner fighters, arrived in Attara at about 10 a.m. Soldiers and Wagner fighters went door to door, pulling men, women, and children out of homes and rounding them up by the Niger river. A 55-year-old man said:



I was at the market when the military and Wagner [fighters] came, ordering everyone to go by the riverside. There were more Wagner [fighters] than Malian soldiers. They rounded up villagers there. They stood in front of us pointing their guns. Then, a Wagner [fighter] took a Quran. He … started preaching. He spoke a language I did not understand, but it wasn’t French. A Malian soldier translated in Bambara [language]. He said: “God authorized us to secure you. The Quran itself says that you must submit to our authority. If you refuse, we will kill you … Do not let yourselves be led astray by the jihadists who lie to you by saying that we, the soldiers, are kuffar (nonbelievers); we are more legitimate than the jihadists.

Witnesses said that some people attempted to escape during the sermon, and the Malian soldiers and Wagner fighters shot them, killing seven men, four of whom fell into the river. The 57-year-old witness said:



As soon as the Wagner [fighter] threatened the community with death, seven people stood up and ran away. But the soldiers and the Wagner [fighters] immediately opened fire. Three were killed by the side of the river and died instantly. Four more attempted to catch a boat but were hit by gunfire and fell into the river … When the soldiers left, we recovered their bodies from the water.

Human Rights Watch obtained three lists of victims compiled by survivors and Attara residents, with names of three men ages 27, 28, and 35. Witnesses said that they could not identify the other four people killed because they were not from Attara, but they said they were all civilians and ethnic Tuareg traders.



Witnesses said that soldiers and Wagner fighters also looted all the shops at the Attara market, taking goods and money. “I used to own a large shop in the Attara market, selling fuel,” said a 74-year-old trader. “I lost up to 5 million CFA [US$8,200] in barrels of fuel. The military took everything from me and looted almost the entire market.”



Dakka Sebbe, Segou Region, January 25



On January 25, scores of Wagner fighters, with at least one Malian soldier, attacked the ethnic-Bozo settlement of Dakka Sebbe, two witnesses said. Dakka Sebbe is in a region where the JNIM regularly carries out attacks. The fighters tortured three ethnic-Fulani herders, men whom they suspected of collaborating with Islamist armed groups.



One of the victims, 35, said:



At 10 a.m., about 100 Wagner [fighters] riding motorbikes stormed the settlement. Because we know that the Wagner [fighters] and the military only go after ethnic-Fulani men, my two friends and I hid in a house. But three Wagner [fighters] broke into the house and pulled us out. They were tall, wore camouflage military uniforms, and carried Kalashnikovs. They were masked. They spoke a language I did not understand.… They started kicking us with their boots … and the butts of their guns. Then, one of the Wagner [fighters] called someone, probably a Malian soldier, and gave me the phone. The man on the phone asked me in Bambara whether we had been caught with weapons. I said no.… But the two other Wagner [fighters] did not seem to be satisfied with my answer and beat us again. One of the two took a knife from his bag and threatened to slaughter us.

Nienanpela, Segou Region, January 23



On January 23, at about 9 a.m., scores of Malian soldiers in pickup trucks stormed Nienanpela village and executed a 75-year-old man, two witnesses reported.



A 52-year-old man said:



Villagers were informed that soldiers from Dougabougou were heading toward Nienanpela. So, everyone fled fearing the military. I hid in the nearby bush and saw a convoy of 17 pickup trucks with Malian soldiers arrive. They carried Kalashnikovs, wore helmets and body armor. They found no one in the village, but an older man who had gone grazing his animals early in the morning and had returned.… When the soldiers left, I went back to the village with other people. We found his body and buried him.

The 34-year-old son of the victim said:



I did not see how the soldiers killed my father because I hid in the bush when they came. But I heard at least two gunshots from my hiding place.… When I went back to the village, I discovered the body of my father lying on the left side, with a bullet wound in the forehead and another one on his right side. My father was an old man and could not run away. Villagers wrapped up his body in some clothes and buried him in the local cemetery.

Dioura, Mopti Region, January 7



On January 7 at about 8 p.m., two Malian soldiers arrested a 50-year-old ethnic-Fulani man whom they suspected of collaborating with Islamist armed groups in Dioura, his relatives said. Villagers found the body of the man the following day with a bullet wound to the head, about a kilometer from Dioura. The JNIM armed group operates in the area.



The man’s mother said:



The soldiers broke into our home and searched it looking for my son. They did not find him. They remained outside. Meanwhile, my son came back from the mosque and was immediately arrested. The soldiers said they would take him to their base, about two kilometers away, for interrogation. I begged them not to. But they said that if I didn’t stop talking, they would kill me. Then they drove off with him in a pickup truck. That was the last time I saw my son.

The wife of the man, who was also present at the time of the arrest, said:



When the soldiers left, I went to see a villager who knows the military and asked him if he could go to their base to inquire about my husband.… The next day he went, and the military told him that my husband was doing fine and that they were not yet done with the interrogation. By noon, however, a man came to my house to inform me that the body of my husband had been found under a tree.

Villagers attempted to bury the man’s body on January 8, but soldiers prevented them from doing so by shooting in the air. “It was thanks to the intercession of a soldier from Dioura that we could bury the body on January 9,” said the victim’s wife.



Gatie Loumo, Mopti Region, December 18, 2023



On December 18 at about 9. a.m., Malian soldiers and Wagner fighters searching for Islamist fighters surrounded the village of Gatie Loumo, in the Mopti region where the JNIM operates, three witnesses said. The military arrived in about 30 vehicles, including three armored vehicles, pickup trucks, and motorbikes. They entered the village on foot heading towards the market area where they killed at least 21 men, and looted motorbikes, shops, and money. Witnesses said that the soldiers and the Wagner fighters came from the military base in Leré, about 30 kilometers from Gatie Loumo, and that the attack was a reprisal against the community for allegedly collaborating with Islamist armed groups.



A 35-year-old villager said:



About 10 days before the attack, we received messages on WhatsApp saying that the military and Wagner [fighters] based in Leré were preparing an operation in our area and specifically in Gatie Loumo.… In fact, the day of the attack, the soldiers arrived from and left to that direction.

He said that they also found the body of one of those killed from the village on the road linking Gatie Loumo to Leré.



A 52-year-old trader said:



The Wagner [fighters] were masked or wore sunglasses. The Malians were not masked. Both had the same camouflage uniform and were heavily armed. Once at the market, they began to arrest traders. Wagner [fighters] carried out the arrests. … Many fled out of fear. … I saw a Wagner [fighter] shoot a cattle trader from close range at about 20 meters from where I was standing in my shop. The victim fell and the Wagner [fighter] searched his pockets and stole money. Then, that same Wagner [fighter], with another one and a Malian soldier, headed toward my shop. The Malian soldier asked me: “What are you doing here?” I replied that it was my shop. He said that I am selling products to the jihadists. I replied that I only sell biscuits and candies to the kids. So, he said: “Don’t sell your stuff to terrorists.” And then, they left.

Another 35-year-old man said:



I was at the market with my friend Salla Dambere, a well-known trader. The soldiers and the Wagner [fighters] invaded the market, looting shops and shooting people. They took Salla and beat him before taking him away. I ran to save my life. … When they [soldiers] were gone, I was informed that Salla’s body was found on the road between Gatie Loumo and Leré, where the soldiers came from. I went there with six other men, and I saw the body. I noticed marks of torture; his throat had been slit. He was slaughtered like an animal. We buried the body where we found it. On my way back to the village, I saw the body of another man, an ethnic Tuareg, shot in the head.

The first 35-year-old man said:



When the soldiers left, we identified the bodies of 14 people from Gatie Loumo, and we buried them in four graves. The other seven people killed were not from Gatie Loumo, they came from the nearby village of Kelesegui, so we could not identify them. But the following day, their relatives came to take these bodies. All the people were shot in the head or in the chest.

Human Rights Watch obtained three lists of victims compiled by survivors and Gatie Loumo residents, with the names of 14 people between 20 and 70 years.



Witnesses said soldiers and Wagner fighters looted almost all shops at the market, as well as motorbikes and money.



“The material toll of the attack is heavy,” said the 52-year-old trader. “The soldiers and the Wagner [fighters] looted about 20 shops, 60 Sanili motorbikes, and nearly thirty million CFA francs from the traders they killed.”",VERY HIGH,20240328T053000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Malian Foreign Affairs Minister Abdoulaye Diop, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Ilaria Allegrozzi (Human Rights Watch)",Malian armed forces and Wagner Group foreign fighters,"Central and Northern Mali, specific areas include Konokassi, Ouro Fero, Attara, Dakka Sebbe, Nienanpela, Dioura, Gatie Loumo","Renew and adequately resource UN Human Rights Council expert mandate in Mali, conduct credible investigations into abuses.",Unlawfully killing and summarily executing civilians during counterinsurgency operations,Mali,"Long-standing conflict with Islamist armed groups, deteriorating relations with international bodies"

A Michigan law that requires a young person to obtain parental consent to have an abortion threatens the health and safety of youth in the state and violates their human rights.

In some cases, disclosing a pregnancy to a parent will result in abuse or being forced to leave home or continue the pregnancy, and judicial bypass can be subjective and cause delays.

Michigan’s forced parental consent for abortion law should be immediately repealed to ensure young people’s safety and dignity.

(New York) – A Michigan law that requires a young person to obtain parental consent to have an abortion threatens the health and safety of youth in the state and violates their human rights, according to a new report released today by Human Rights Watch, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Michigan, and the Michigan Organization on Adolescent Sexual Health (MOASH).

The 36-page report, “In Harm’s Way: How Michigan’s Forced Parental Consent for Abortion Law Hurts Young People” examines the impact of a Michigan law that requires people under age 18 seeking an abortion to have a parent or legal guardian’s written consent or get approval from a judge in a process known as “judicial bypass.”

The report found that some young people fear that disclosing a pregnancy to a parent will result in physical or emotional abuse, being forced to move out of the home, being forced to continue the pregnancy against their will, or alienation from their families. The alternative, judicial bypass, can be invasive, distressing, and even traumatizing for young people, the report found. Judges’ decisions can be highly subjective, and those with anti-abortion views can unduly block young people’s ability to get care. Judicial bypass often delays care by a week or more, limiting patients’ already constrained and time-sensitive healthcare options.

“No one should have to face a judge to access basic health care,” said Jo Becker, children’s rights advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. “Michigan should repeal this harmful and dehumanizing law.”

The report is based on court data from 2007 through 2022, in-depth interviews with nearly two dozen Michigan experts, including judicial bypass attorneys, healthcare providers, and reproductive justice advocates, as well as analysis of state health department data and other state records. Other report findings include:

About 700 young people (mostly ages 16 and 17) have abortions in Michigan each year, and more than 85 percent involve a parent in their abortion decision.

When a young person does not involve a parent, it is often rooted in concern for their safety and well-being. One healthcare provider said a young client told her: “I can’t tell my parents because they will literally beat me, kick me out, and I’ll be on the street.”

Some young people do not have access to a parent or legal guardian due to a parent’s illness, death, or incarceration; challenges establishing or demonstrating legal guardianship; or other reasons.

State court data showed that each year about 100 young people—roughly 14 percent of those under 18 obtaining abortions in the state—go through the judicial bypass process.

Young people face logistical hurdles throughout the judicial bypass process, including finding an attorney, scheduling and attending hearings, taking time off school, and securing transportation to and from court.

Some attorneys said judges made stigmatizing comments or gave their clients demeaning lectures before granting their petitions. One attorney said that a judge asked her client: “Are you aware that some people who have abortions regret it later in life?” Another attorney said a judge lectured his client about adoption as an alternative, citing couples who were unable to have children.

The time required for judicial bypass can leave young people ineligible for medication abortion, forcing them to have more expensive and invasive procedures.

The law compels some young people to involve unsupportive or abusive parents in their abortion decisions, even when it is not in their best interests. One healthcare provider said she had treated multiple young people whose parents asked her to withhold pain medication during their abortion procedures.

“Forced parental consent not only violates a young person’s constitutional right to make decisions about their reproductive health, it needlessly delays care and harms pregnant young people,” said Merissa Kovach, political director at the ACLU of Michigan. “That is why the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, and the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine are among medical organizations in agreement that young people should not be compelled or required to involve parents in their decisions about abortion care.”

The report concludes that Michigan’s forced parental consent law undermines the safety, health, and dignity of young people seeking abortion care in Michigan, whether they obtain parental consent or go through judicial bypass, and regardless of whether their request for a judicial waiver is granted or denied.

The report urges the immediate repeal of Michigan’s forced parental consent for abortion law to ensure that people under 18 can access this health care without being forced to involve a parent, legal guardian, or judge.

“Young people deserve the right to have power and control over their bodies, including if and when they are pregnant,” said Taryn Gal, executive director at the Michigan Organization on Adolescent Sexual Health (MOASH). “Youth in Michigan tell us that the judicial bypass process is not youth-friendly or accessible; it creates an unwarranted barrier to critical health care. No young person should be forced to continue a pregnancy that they do not want.”",HIGH,20240328T043000Z,"Human Rights Watch, ACLU of Michigan, MOASH","Jo Becker (Human Rights Watch), Merissa Kovach (ACLU of Michigan), Taryn Gal (MOASH)",State of Michigan,"Michigan, United States",Repeal forced parental consent law to uphold youth health and rights,Forced parental consent for abortion violates human rights and jeopardizes youth health and safety,United States,"Concerns about parental involvement and abuse, societal attitudes towards youth rights and reproductive health"

(Bangkok) – The Thai parliament’s upper house should promptly pass a same-sex marriage bill that the lower house approved by an overwhelming majority on March 27, 2024, Human Rights Watch said today. Thailand would become the first country in Southeast Asia, and the second in Asia, to recognize same-sex relationships.

Thailand’s House of Representatives passed the Marriage Equality Act with the approval of 400 of the 415 members present. Ten voted against the bill, two abstained, and three did not vote.

“Thailand is poised to send an important message to the rest of Asia by recognizing same-sex relationships,” said Kyle Knight, interim co-director of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights program at Human Rights Watch. “Lawmakers should not delay this important occasion, which could create momentum across the region to respect the fundamental rights of LGBT people.”

The rights to marry and to form a family are fundamental rights recognized in article 23 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which Thailand has ratified. Various international human rights bodies, including the United Nations Human Rights Committee, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women have rejected the idea that a “family,” as understood under international human rights law, must conform to any single model.

Thailand’s Marriage Equality Act makes important amendments to the civil and commercial code language concerning spouses, in particular by changing “men and women” and “husband and wife” to “individuals” and “marriage partners.” However, LGBT rights advocates have raised concerns that it leaves in place “mother” and “father,” rather than replacing those terms with the more gender-neutral “parent,” which could cause complications for same-sex couples attempting to adopt and raise children.

Thirty-seven countries currently recognize same-sex marriage in their national laws. Taiwan became the first country in Asia to recognize same-sex marriage in 2019. Nepal has recognized some same-sex marriages in 2023 and 2024 under an interim order from the Supreme Court while a final judgment is forthcoming.

Passing same-sex marriage legislation is an opportunity for Thailand to match its positive global reputation on LGBT rights with tangible legal protections, Human Rights Watch said. For decades, Thailand has been a destination for LGBT tourists, and in particular for transgender people seeking gender-affirming health care. Thailand still offers no protections for transgender people, and lawmakers should also seriously consider passing much-needed reforms for trans rights as well.

“Social acceptance has its limitations and is no substitute for protections grounded in law,” Knight said. “Thailand is on the brink of offering more legal protections for LGBT people than it ever has in its history, and setting a positive example for the region.”",LOW,20240328T043000Z,Human Rights Watch,Kyle Knight,Thai parliament’s upper house,"Bangkok, Thailand",Pass the same-sex marriage bill and implement protections for transgender rights,Failure to promptly pass a same-sex marriage bill,Thailand,"Social acceptance, lack of legal recognition for same-sex relationships"

This submission focuses on mandatory hijab regulations, Indonesia’s new criminal code, the right to education, and the rights of children with disabilities.

Mandatory Hijab Regulations (articles 2, 14, 16, 24, and 28)

Since first being introduced in West Sumatra in 2001, Indonesia has imposed 120 local mandatory hijab regulations, compelling millions of girls and women to wear the jilbab, or hijab, the female headdress covering the hair, neck, and chest. It is usually required in combination with a long skirt and a long-sleeved shirt. The National Commission on Violence Against Women reported that 73 such regulations were still in force as of August 2023. [1] Sanctions include verbal warnings, expulsion from school or work, and jail terms of up to three months.

In 2021, Human Rights Watch documented widespread bullying of girls and women to pressure them to wear the jilbab, as well as the deep psychological distress such bullying causes.[2] In at least 24 provinces, girls who did not comply were forced to leave school or withdrew under pressure.[3] Bullying and intimidation to wear the jilbab also takes place on social media. Human Rights Watch documented intimidating and threatening messages, including death threats and threats of violence, conveyed to girls via Facebook and WhatsApp.

By July 2022, nearly 150,000 schools in Indonesia’s 24 Muslim-majority provinces enforced mandatory jilbab rules, based on both local and national regulations. In some conservative Muslim areas such as Aceh and West Sumatra, even non-Muslim girls have also been forced to wear the jilbab.[4]

In June 2014, then-Education Minister Mohammad Nuh issued an ambiguously worded regulation that implied all female Muslim students from grades 1 to 12 (roughly ages 6 to 18) must wear a jilbab as part of their state school uniform.[5] In February 2021, Education and Culture Minister Nadiem Makarim, Home Affairs Minister Tito Karnavian, and Religious Affairs Minister Yaqut Cholil Qoumas formally issued a decree that allows any student or teacher to choose what to wear in school with or without “religious attributes.” The decree ordered local governments and school principals and administrations to abandon regulations requiring a jilbab in state schools.[6]

In May 2021, Indonesia’s Supreme Court canceled the new regulation. The panel of three judges ruled that the regulation violated four national laws, and children have no right to choose their clothes.[7] In response, more than 800 public figures signed a petition condemning the Supreme Court’s decision and asked the Judiciary Commission to review it, saying the regulation was unconstitutional and discriminatory. In June 2021, the Judiciary Commission rejected the petition on a technicality.[8]

In a bid to overcome the Supreme Court ban, in September 2022, the education minister issued a new regulation on state school uniforms, decreeing that schools should not mandate girls “to wear a certain uniform.” It also requires that local governments adhere to this national regulation. However, the new regulation did not require local governments to revoke their respective mandatory hijab rules, which the previous (now cancelled) decree required.[9]

Human Rights Watch recommends that the Committee call on the government of Indonesia to:

Issue a public policy statement that all national and local ordinances and regulations requiring the jilbab and other female clothing are discriminatory, should not be enforced, and should be repealed.

Send to parliament draft legislation repealing existing provincial and local regulations that discriminate on the basis of gender, including regulations that require girls to wear a jilbab or other prescribed clothing, and banning any new discriminatory regulations in the future.

Work with Islamic organizations, including the Nahdlatul Ulama and the Muhammadiyah, to create a public messaging campaign against requiring or pressuring girls to wear the jilbab or other Islamic dress, and promoting tolerance and inclusivity.

Order government officials to revoke discriminatory ordinances and to stop pressuring girls to wear the jilbab or other religious dress and take disciplinary action against those who violate this order.

Indonesia’s New Criminal Code (articles 2, 6, 16, 17, 24, and 28)

Indonesia’s parliament passed a new criminal code in December 2022 that contains provisions that constitute serious infringements of human rights, including the rights to life, health, freedom from torture and degrading treatment, and privacy.[10]

Articles in the law maintain the criminalization of abortion with some exceptions, and now also criminalize distributing information about contraception to children and providing information about obtaining an abortion to anyone. These provisions especially harm girls, in particular their rights to comprehensive and inclusive sexual and reproductive health education and information. They also negatively impact girls’ ability to protect their health and to make informed choices about their bodies. These provisions can lead to unwanted pregnancies, which can affect a range of rights, including ending a girl’s education, contributing to child marriage, as well as putting girls’ health and lives at risk.[11]

The new law also provides that the government will recognize “any living law” in the country, which is likely to be interpreted to extend formal legality to hundreds of Sharia (Islamic law) regulations imposed by local officials in areas across the country. Many of these regulations discriminate against girls and include provisions such as curfews specifically targeting females, female genital mutilation, and mandatory hijab dress codes.[12]

Human Rights Watch recommends that the Committee call on the government of Indonesia to:

Repeal all discriminatory clauses in the new Criminal Code, including those that violate the rights to health and education of children.

Right to Education (article 28)

Indonesia provides nine years of free and compulsory basic education,[13] comprising primary and junior secondary levels.[14] Indonesia does not provide universal free pre-primary education. In 2015, the government committed to implementing a 12-year compulsory education policy,[15] yet completion rates at the lower and upper secondary levels were 88 percent and 67 percent respectively in 2020.[16] At the pre-primary level, the net enrollment rate was just 43 percent in 2022.[17]

Access to education during the Covid-19 pandemic

From March 2020 to March 2022, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, Indonesian schools were fully closed for 20 weeks and only partially open for 72 weeks.[18] While the government transitioned to various forms of distance learning, Human Rights Watch found several barriers to accessing education.[19]

For example, a student in a small village in North Sulawesi said that around 30 percent of his classmates lived in remote areas with internet that was so unreliable that “these classmates [could not] participate in online class because there [was] no signal when it rain[ed].”[20] Some children went to extraordinary lengths to try to access the internet for learning. One student who lived on the island of Borneo travelled 24 kilometers by motorbike, four times a week, to find a strong enough phone signal to receive WhatsApp messages from her teachers and email back her assignments.[21]

Some children had no access to any kind of device that would enable learning or allow them to stay in touch with their teachers. A student in Papua said she returned assignments by phone. But “in my class, all students who [did] not have an [Android] phone are Indigenous Papuan students, plus three new settler children [predominately from Java]. How could you learn without an [Android] phone?” She also said that although her school distributed some schoolbooks, they did not give out physics, biology, and chemistry books “because those books were expensive.”[22]

Protection of education from attack

As of November 2023, Indonesia was contributing 2,452 troops to United Nations peace operations,[23] including in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic, both countries where attacks on education have been documented as a problem.[24] These troops are required to comply with the UN Department of Peace Operations’ UN Infantry Battalion Manual (2012), which includes the provision that “schools shall not be used by the military in their operations.”[25]

The Safe Schools Declaration[26] is an inter-governmental political commitment that provides countries with the opportunity to express political support for the protection of students, teachers, and schools during times of armed conflict; the importance of the continuation of education during armed conflict; and the implementation of the Guidelines for Protecting Schools and Universities from Military Use during Armed Conflict. [27] As of January 2024, 119 states have endorsed the declaration,[28] including 31 fellow members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. However, Indonesia has not endorsed the declaration.

Human Rights Watch recommends that the Committee ask the government of Indonesia:

What barriers does the government see to providing at least one year of free and compulsory pre-primary education, and fully implementing 12 years of free primary and secondary education?

How has the extent of children’s learning loss due to Covid-19 school closures been assessed, and what measures have been taken to remedy lost learning?

Are protections for schools from military use included in any policies, rules, or trainings for Indonesia’s armed forces, including in pre-deployment training for peace operations?

Human Rights Watch recommends that the Committee call on the government of Indonesia to:

Make at least one year of pre-primary education free and compulsory.

Strategically allocate educational resources to marginalized and low-income groups and those shown to have been particularly affected in their education during the pandemic.

Adopt measures to provide affordable, reliable, quality, and accessible internet, including targeted measures to provide free, equitable access to the internet for educational content, and develop or expand device affordability and availability initiatives for schools and families. To the extent that online learning is used beyond Covid-19 school closures, Human Rights Watch recommends that it should be done in a manner that protects children’s privacy online.

Ensure Indonesian laws, policies, or trainings, including pre-deployment trainings for UN peace operations, provide explicit protection for schools from military use during armed conflict.

Endorse and implement the Safe Schools Declaration.

Rights of Children with Disabilities (articles 19, 23, 37, and 39)

In Indonesia, many people with psychosocial disabilities (mental health conditions), including children, are shackled by their families or placed in overcrowded and unsanitary institutions against their will, due to widespread stigma and lack of community-based support, including mental health services. Human Rights Watch conducted research in Indonesia documenting these and other abuses between 2014-2021.[29]

The practice of shackling, known locally as pasung (meaning to “tie” or “bind”), refers to the physical restraint of children and adults with real or perceived psychosocial disabilities, within or just outside the home. Pasung is typically practiced by families who believe that the child with the psychosocial disability is possessed by evil spirits, or are worried that the child might hurt themselves or others, or might run away.

Pasung in Indonesia consists of chaining people or locking them in a room, shed, cage, or animal enclosure (including chicken coops, pig pens, and goat sheds) for periods ranging from hours to days, to years. It can also be a temporary measure that is used to restrain a child with a psychosocial disability for shorter periods, while the family goes out to work or when the child is having a crisis.[30]

Research by Human Rights Watch globally has found that children who are shackled can be affected by post-traumatic stress, malnutrition, infections, nerve damage, muscular atrophy, and cardiovascular problems.[31] In Indonesia, children who were shackled had no movement beyond the length of the chain—normally about two meters, having to bathe, defecate, urinate, and sleep within the radius where they are chained.[32]

In 2015, the UN Special Rapporteur on torture stated that shackling “unequivocally amount[s] to torture even if committed by non-State actors under conditions in which the State knows or ought to know about them.”[33]

Pasung is also practiced in faith healing centers and state-run residential institutions as a form of restraint, punishment, or “treatment.” In the case of private institutions and healing centers, management may have an incentive to detain children as they are paid by the family. In many countries, including Indonesia, it is a profitable business.

The Indonesian government officially banned pasung under law in 1977. However, the practice remains to this day. It is estimated that 57,000 people with psychosocial disabilities in Indonesia, including children, have been shackled at least once in their lives, with approximately 15,000 still living in chains as of November 2019.[34]

In 2022, the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities called on the Indonesian government to “prohibit the use of shackling, seclusion and all forms of restraints in all settings, including within family settings and in social care institutions, and develop and promote non-coercive, community-based mental health supports and services.”[35]

In 2020, Human Rights Watch published a global report noting the positive steps taken by the Indonesian government to tackle shackling, including a national outreach and awareness raising program reaching over 48 million people.[36] Nonetheless, Indonesia’s national basic health survey (Riskesdas) showed that in 2018, 12,800 people, including children, were still shackled or locked in confined spaces (down from 18,800 in 2016).

Institutionalization

The institutionalization of children with disabilities is widespread in Indonesia and has already been noted as an issue of particular concern to this Committee.[37]

Under Indonesian law, it is relatively easy to involuntarily admit a person with a psychosocial disability to an institution. The Mental Health Act (2014) allows a family member or guardian to admit a child or adult with a psychosocial disability without their consent to a mental health or social care institution without any judicial review. Children placed in residential care institutions have the right to a periodic review of the treatment they received, but Human Rights Watch found this not to be the case, with many institutions not even having formal admission or discharge processes.[38]

Detention in faith-healing centers is also arbitrary. For example, Haji Hamdan Saiful Bahri, an Islamic faith healer who runs Kampung ChiLanjang, a private healing center in Cianjur, described how he diagnosed a 13-year-old boy before admitting him to his institution for religious treatment. Bahri said: “I touched his chest, head, and legs to do photo sonogram [X-ray] to find out his illness. He started screaming so I knew he was depressed.” The process for discharge was similarly arbitrary. “When the [body] heat becomes cold, they’re ready to leave,” Bahri said. “When I take them outside to the market or to play football and the person feels cold, it means they’re cured.”[39]

State-run residential institutions and private faith-healing centers where children with disabilities are arbitrarily detained are exceptionally overcrowded and unsanitary and lack measures to support personal hygiene. Residents commonly lack access to a toilet and are forced to eat, sleep, urinate, and defecate in a radius of no more than one to two meters. In state-run mental hospitals, people with disabilities, including children, are also routinely forced to take medication, locked in isolation rooms, and subjected to involuntary treatment ranging from physical and chemical restraints to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).[40]

Human Rights Watch found that children were being subjected to “unmodified” ECT at one institution visited, Grogol Mental Hospital in Java.[41] This was done without any apparent consent from the patient or their families, and the ECT consent form at the hospital did not even have a space for a patient’s or guardian’s signature. The child’s consent and preferences are not taken into account in function of their evolving capacity. Then-UN Special Rapporteur on torture Manfred Nowak noted that unmodified ECT (that is, administered without anesthesia, muscle relaxants, and oxygen) is an unacceptable medical practice that may constitute torture or ill-treatment, which can lead to cognitive defects and loss of memory.[42]

The World Health Organization Resource Book on mental health, human rights, and legislation states that “there are no indications for the use of ECT on minors [defined as anyone below 18], and hence this should be prohibited through legislation.”[43]

Human Rights Watch also found instances of institutions routinely placing children in enforced seclusion, usually as a form of punishment or disciplinary measure. In hospitals, children have separate isolation rooms within the children’s ward, but in social care institutions, children were found to share rooms with adults, with limited or no oversight.[44] This leaves children at unacceptable risk of harm and abuse and represents failure by the institutions to adequately protect them.

At all six hospitals visited by Human Rights Watch, children with psychosocial disabilities were subject to physical restraint during a crisis, a fight, or if they resisted while being injected with medication. The use of physical restraints is permissible under the Mental Health Act (2014), despite the UN Special Rapporteur on torture having previously stated that “there can be no therapeutic justification for the use of… prolonged restraint of persons with disabilities… [which] may constitute torture or ill-treatment.”[45] The current Special Rapporteur on torture has noted that the restraint of an individual with psychosocial disabilities in particular, even for a short time, may constitute torture or inhumane treatment.[46]

Human Rights Watch recommends that the Committee call on the Indonesian government to:

Strengthen and monitor the implementation of laws banning pasung.

Recognize institutionalization based on the existence of a disability as a form of discrimination and without consent of the individual as a form of arbitrary detention.

Ensure that children who have been released from state and private institutions have access to psychosocial support and social services, including specialist child psychologists and support services.

Ban all forms of involuntary treatment, including ECT, without the person’s free and informed consent and in all circumstances involving children. Explicitly prohibit the use of seclusion and prolonged restraint.

Develop a time-bound plan to shift progressively to community-based mental health, support, and independent living services.

Create and implement a de-institutionalization policy and a time-bound action plan for de-institutionalization, based on the values of equality, independence, and inclusion for children with disabilities.

Conduct regular, unannounced monitoring visits to government and private social care institutions as well as faith-healing centers, with unhindered and confidential interaction with both staff and patients, and report publicly on the findings from these visits.

Train and sensitize government health workers, mental health professionals, and staff in institutions to the concerns and needs of persons with psychosocial disabilities, including children, and create a confidential and effective complaint mechanism for individuals with psychosocial disabilities to report abuse.

(Beirut) – A Houthi court sentenced 32 men, 9 of them to death, on January 23, 2024, in an unfair mass trial based on dubious charges of “sodomy,” Human Rights Watch said today. The Houthis should end their use of the death penalty and other forms of cruel and degrading punishment and provide fair trials for those charged.

In addition to death sentences that include crucifixion and stoning, the Houthi court sentenced 23 men to prison for periods of up to 10 years. Three of them were also sentenced to public flogging. The initial court indictment, dated October 17, 2023, included serious due process violations and egregious violations of Yemen’s own criminal procedural code, Human Rights Watch found.

“In an abhorrent disregard for the rule of law, the Houthis are handing down death sentences and subjecting men to public mistreatment without a semblance of due process,” said Niku Jafarnia, Yemen and Bahrain researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The Houthis are using these cruel measures to distract from their failure to govern and provide people in their territories with basic needs.”

Human Rights Watch reviewed the official indictments against the 32 men by the Houthi courts and videos of the Houthi court proceedings posted on social media, and interviewed a lawyer with knowledge of the case. Blatant due process violations included police officers failing to provide arrest warrants and unlawfully searching and confiscating the men’s phones. The lawyer questioned whether those charged had adequate access to legal counsel.

Human Rights Watch has documented serious violations by governments in the Middle East and North Africa targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people online and using “illegitimately obtained digital photos, chats, and similar information” to prosecute them.

The Yemeni Criminal Procedures law, under articles 132 and 172, prohibits warrantless arrests as well as seizing people’s belongings in police custody. Article 181 also prohibits police interrogations without the presence of a lawyer.

The Houthi armed group took over Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, in September 2014, causing the internationally recognized Yemeni government to flee. The Houthis, as a non-state actor that exercises “de facto control over [a] territory and population,” are obligated to “respect and protect the human rights of individuals and groups” living under their control.

Human Rights Watch has also documented systematic abuses in Houthi prisons. In a 2023 report, the UN Security Council’s Panel of Experts on Yemen found that “Houthi-held prisoners are subjected to systematic psychological and physical torture, including the denial of medical intervention to cure the injuries caused by the torture inflicted, which for some prisoners resulted in permanent disabilities and death.”

On October 10, 2023, another Houthi-run court in Dhamar city, a Yemeni governorate south of Sanaa, convicted 16 men of committing “immoral acts,” according to the official indictment reviewed by Human Rights Watch. According to a post on X by al-Mashhad al-Yemeni, a local news website, on February 14, 2024, Houthi forces gathered 30 men, including the 16 men who had been convicted on October 10, in a cemetery in Dhamar, and stated that they were going to execute the men by stoning them to death. The men were instead returned to detention, according to the same local news website.

Two activists and a lawyer told Human Rights Watch that the families of several defendants fled Dhamar governorate to escape the social stigma associated with the accusations. Another Yemeni activist with knowledge of the case said: “Charging and putting people on trial because of ‘immoral acts’ has catastrophic long-term consequences on people’s lives in Yemen, even if they are fabricated or made up. Those charged and their families will be impacted and stigmatized forever.”

Houthis have repeatedly arrested people who have been critical of their policies under the guise of “committing immoral acts,” Human Rights Watch said. In January 2024, the Houthis arrested Judge Abdulwahab Qatran on charges related to alcohol consumption after he criticized the Houthis’ Red Sea attacks on social media. In 2021, a Houthi court sentenced a Yemeni model and actress, Intisar al-Hammadi, as well as three other women, to prison after convicting them on charges of committing “an indecent act.”

According to Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor, Houthi courts have sentenced 350 people to death since taking over the capital in 2014 and executed 11 of them. On September 18, 2021, Houthi forces executed 9 people, reportedly including a 17-year-old, in Sanaa’s Tahrir Square. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said that “the defendants were sentenced to death in a judicial process that violated their constitutional rights and did not comply with fair trial standards under international law.”

International human rights standards, including the Arab Charter on Human Rights, ratified by Yemen, obligate countries that use the death penalty to restrict its enforcement to exceptional circumstances for the “most serious crimes.”

Human Rights Watch opposes the death penalty in all countries and under all circumstances. Capital punishment is unique in its cruelty and finality, and its determination is often plagued with arbitrariness, prejudice, and error, Human Rights Watch said.

“To cover up their brutality, Houthis are charging people with immoral acts, especially for those who oppose them,” said Jafarnia. “The Houthis should immediately end the use of the death penalty and other forms of cruel and degrading punishments and provide due process for those charged.”",VERY HIGH,20240327T050000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Niku Jafarnia (HRW researcher), Judge Abdulwahab Qatran, Intisar al-Hammadi",Houthi court,"Dhamar city and Sanaa, Yemen","End the death penalty and cruel treatments, ensure due process","Unfair mass trial, death sentences, and due process violations",Yemen,"Houthi governance failures, social stigma in Yemen"

NOTE: Andrew is off on holiday, and while he's gone we'll be featuring some of his colleagues' work. Today's main story is authored by Kseniya Kvitka, Assistant Researcher on Ukraine.

On March 2, Andriy Sidak raced to his sister’s apartment building fearing the worst.

Earlier, a Russian drone had struck the building in the north part of Odesa. What he found was rubble and dust, the mangled remains of what had been a nine-story residential building. Witnesses say the drone hit the building at the sixth-floor level, causing concrete slabs of the upper floors of the building to collapse on the lower levels.

Sidak entered what remained of the apartment where his sister Anna Gaidarzhi lived with her husband Serhii and two children, a four-month-old son Tymofii and a three-year-old daughter Lizzi.

“The living room …, where they had a piano and a sofa, was gone. The huge concrete slab blocked the doorway to the bedroom where Anna and Tymofii slept,” said Sidak. “Their bodies were found last … in the basement. They died in their sleep, flattened by the rubble.”

Serhii and Lizzi survived.

In total, 12 people were killed in the attack, five of them children, the youngest of them Tymofii Gaidarzhi. The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine called it “the deadliest incident for children in more than nine months.”

Mykhailo Voitov, who lived on the seventh floor, was also killed in the collapse. His wife, Angelina, had fled to Germany in 2022 with their 11-year-old daughter because she was distressed about the war. The couple had been married for 33 years, and before the war started, had never been apart for more than one day.

“Our daughter was very frightened,” Angelina said after her husband’s funeral. “She has only just begun to settle down. I don’t know how her father’s death will impact her.”

Ukrainian authorities stated that the defense forces shot down seven drones launched by the Russian forces into Odesa that night. One drone hit a residential building. Human Rights Watch was unable to determine whether Ukrainian forces attempted to intercept the drone.

Russia’s full-scale invasion has killed and injured tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians. According to the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, most of the casualties have been from the use in populated areas of explosive weapons, such as missiles, drones, and artillery.

“The country is falling apart. There is no state authority left. The authorities now are the criminals.”

The words of a senior police official sum up the situation in Haiti today.

What this means for ordinary Haitians, however, was perhaps better expressed by a 23-year-old mechanic in the capital, Port-au-Prince: “There is no state, the police are scared, and they have no way to defend us from the gangs that shoot, kill, kidnap, rape women, and take away everything from us on a daily basis.”

Haiti is on the brink of a total collapse. In fact, it’s probably already past that point, as violent criminal groups seek to overthrow the government.

The groups’ actions have practically shut down the economy and the delivery of humanitarian aid. Their assaults on two prisons have set loose almost 4,700 prisoners. Nearly all transportation, including the country’s main port and international airport, is at a standstill.

The prime minister, Ariel Henry, failed to organize elections and step down by February 7 as promised, leading to protests and deeper chaos. Now, he’s outside the country, unable to return since he traveled to Kenya to finalize arrangements for the Kenyan-led international security support mission, which has been beset by legal, funding, and operational problems.

Right now, the most powerful person in the country may be Jimmy Chérizier aka “Barbecue,” the leader of Haiti’s main criminal coalition, known as G9. He’s working with a rival criminal gang to remove Henry from power and confront the international support mission when it arrives.

Criminal gangs already control much of the country. They have killed more than 1,100 people and injured nearly 700 others in 2024 alone. Some 13,000 people have been killed, injured, and kidnapped by criminal groups since January 2022. Thousands of women and children have been victims of sexual violence.

More than 362,000 people have been internally displaced. Food insecurity in Haiti is among the worst in the world. Many children are out of school, and often fall prey to recruitment by criminal gangs.

The people of Haiti desperately need international support, and the Kenyan-led mission will certainly be entering an extremely hostile environment. Pledges of support have come from the US, Canada, and France. Benin, Chad, Bangladesh, Barbados, and The Bahamas have committed to deploying forces alongside Kenyan police officers.

The history of international interventions in Haiti is littered with serious errors, even horrors. Governments need to avoid past failures, which means putting the protection of human rights at the core of the mission.

Haitian civil society could help show the way. Independent charities and activist groups have developed proposals to restore the rule of law, security, and access to basic necessities. International actors should work with these folks on the ground who understand the situation best.

(New York) – Pakistan’s newly elected prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, should make human rights a key focus of his government, Human Rights Watch said in a letter today to the prime minister. The new Pakistani government should adopt an agenda that actively promotes and protects human rights, advances the rule of law, and strengthens democratic institutions.

“Pakistani Prime Minister Sharif’s new government faces many challenges that need to be addressed by upholding human rights,” said Patricia Gossman, associate Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The government should begin by reversing abusive laws and policies and demonstrating a genuine commitment to the rule of law and equal justice.”

As Pakistan faces one of the worst economic crises in its history, the government has an obligation to ensure adequate social security to uphold the rights of Pakistanis to health, food, social security, and an adequate standard of living.

Human Rights Watch urged the Pakistani government to take concrete steps to protect fundamental civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights in nine key areas. These are economic justice; electoral reforms; digital rights; freedom of expression and protecting civil society; freedom of religion and belief; prison reform; ending violence against women and girls; improving access to education; and protecting rights in counterterrorism operations.",HIGH,20240311T144500Z,Human Rights Watch,Shehbaz Sharif,Government of Pakistan,Pakistan,"Adopt an agenda to protect human rights, enact reforms in key areas, and ensure accountability",Failure to uphold human rights and address abusive laws and policies,Pakistan,"Economic crisis, inadequate social policies, and abusive legislation"

For most of the world, restrictions put in place during the Covid-19 pandemic are a distant memory.

In North Korea, however, key pandemic-related restrictions are still in place – and it’s making people’s lives even more miserable in the hellscape of the so-called “Democratic People’s Republic.”

Specifically, this is about restrictions on movement and trade. In 2020, as the global pandemic raged, North Korea’s government largely sealed its border with neighboring China. It imposed excessive and unnecessary quarantines and new restrictions on economic activity and freedom of movement.

These measures have severely undermined food security in the country. Previously, many products North Koreans needed to survive entered the country from China through formal and informal trade routes. The Covid-related restrictions have worsened the already grave humanitarian and human rights situation in the country.

UN Security Council sanctions from 2016 and 2017, which limited most exports and some imports, add to the difficulties. The intention of the sanctions may have been to try to push the North Korean government to moderate some of its more unhinged geopolitical actions.

However, the sanctions have had the unintentional effect of hurting ordinary North Koreans. Their economic impact has harmed people’s ability to make a living and access food and essential goods.

In a sense, people are caught between the hammer of an extremely abusive government and the anvil of an international community, which is so frustrated with the totalitarian regime in Pyongyang, tries policies that have unintended consequences for long-suffering, ordinary North Koreans.

But while the UN Security Council should certainly review current sanctions on North Korea and their impacts, let’s be clear: the primary problem is the government, one of the most repressive in the world. Even before Covid-19 restrictions were put in place, North Korea was among the most authoritarian and isolated countries anywhere.

Ultimately, easing the hardships ordinary North Koreans face would take some serious policy reversals from North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un: reopening the borders for trade, relaxing internal travel restrictions, and allowing monitored international emergency assistance. In short, he should end all these “policies that have essentially made North Korea a giant prison.”

Just scrapping the pandemic-related restrictions would be a start.

Tomorrow, eleven Ugandan students will appear before a Kampala court for their activism against the planned East Africa crude oil pipeline (EACOP), one of the largest fossil fuel infrastructure projects currently under development globally. This is the latest in a series of harassment, threats, and arbitrary arrests against EACOP protestors.

These trials are part of a deeply concerning escalation of threats against human rights defenders in Uganda, particularly those raising concerns around oil development.

Police arrested the students last year, and according to media reports, beat them before remanding them to a maximum security prison. They are charged with the colonial era “common nuisance” offense, which Ugandan authorities have used to suppress legitimate protests.

Activists in Uganda oppose EACOP because of the risks it poses to the environment, local communities, and its potential contribution to climate change. And its construction coincides with a growing consensus amongst experts, including from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , that there cannot be any new fossil fuel projects if the world is to limit the worst impacts of climate change.

Last month, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders Mary Lawlor urged Ugandan authorities to “change course,” highlighting that “a pattern is emerging from Uganda, in which students peacefully advocating for the protection of human rights and the mitigation of climate change are violently arrested and criminalized.” Earlier this year, Lawlor and other UN Special Rapporteurs expressed grave concerns for the “violent arrests and alleged arbitrary detention of human rights defenders advocating for a just transition from the use of fossil fuels” in Uganda.

Last year, Human Rights Watch released a report documenting the Ugandan government’s crackdown on anti-fossil fuel activists and environmental defenders. The report documented harassment, threats, and arbitrary arrests of protesters lawfully raising concerns over EACOP’s potential contribution to climate change. It followed an earlier HRW report which documented violations related to EACOP's land acquisition process, including inadequate compensation for landowners, and undue pressure, intimidation, and threats of legal action against those who rejected compensation offers.

People have the right to protest peacefully about a planned pipeline that poses grave environmental and human rights risks.

When long-debated legislation is finally agreed on, optimists and pessimists often argue about whether the result of the political negotiations is a theoretical glass half-full or glass half-empty. This one tends toward the former.

Yesterday’s news that EU politicians approved a forced labor import ban is certainly encouraging. It will eventually help stop products linked to forced labor from entering the EU and increase pressure on governments and companies to stop forced labor practices.

It should ultimately have a positive impact on the estimated 3.9 million people trapped in state-imposed forced labor programs worldwide, not to mention on European manufacturers facing unfair competition.

Regular readers will recall our recent look at aluminum from Xinjiang, China, used by global automakers, as we asked: Is your car driving repression? The conclusion was that, while individual consumer awareness is important, the scale of the problem of forced labor in large-scale manufacturing requires the broader regulatory approach that only governments can provide.

What happened yesterday in the EU was a step in the right direction. After agreement between EU member state ambassadors and members of the European Parliament negotiating the deal, it now goes to the EU Council and Parliament for formal approval.

Experts who’ve been working for years to see this happen were rightly pleased.

Chloe Cranston of Anti-Slavery International called it a “huge result … Despite its weaknesses, this is a major step forward for ending forced labour globally.”

Steve Trent of the Environmental Justice Foundation, said it sent “a powerful message that the EU is upholding the fundamental values of dignity and respect for all people.”

My Human Rights Watch colleague Jim Wormington said it was “great news,” adding: “When it comes into force, the law will mean companies benefitting from forced labor, in Xinjiang and elsewhere, cannot sell to EU markets.”

But everyone involved also recognizes the EU’s new forced labor law is not all it could be.

It is, as my colleague Jim notes with regard to Xinjiang, weaker than the US law called the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. That US law, which came into force in 2022, rightly establishes the presumption that any product produced in whole or in part in Xinjiang, China, is made with forced labor and cannot be imported.

Still, the EU law does include measures to help investigators identify and stop products linked to state-imposed forced labor from entering the EU.

So, overall, the news is good. There is progress. The optimists can say the theoretical glass is half-full.

In late February, I joined youth from 14 countries for a four-day seminar on the rising civilian toll caused by bombing and shelling with explosive weapons in towns and cities during armed conflict. The event was hosted by Mines Action Canada, a co-founder—along with Human Rights Watch—of the International Network on Explosive Weapons (INEW).

The Political Declaration on the Protection of Civilians from the Use of Explosive Weapons in Populated Areas, adopted in Dublin, Ireland on November 18, 2022, provided guidance for the meeting. A total of 85 countries have endorsed the declaration, committing to prevent and provide remedies for the devastating humanitarian consequences of the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. The declaration calls on countries to adopt “policies and practices to help avoid civilian harm, including by restricting or refraining as appropriate from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas, when their use may be expected to cause harm to civilians or civilian objects.”

The seminar brought together young advocates, campaigners, and workers from countries affected by the use of explosive weapons, including Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sudan, Syria, and Ukraine. Rooting their interventions in their experiences, they exchanged community-sensitive best practices for local advocacy, education, and rebuilding efforts.

Participants challenged the idea that the use of explosive weapons in populated areas is an inevitable part of modern-day conflicts and discussed ways to encourage states to join the declaration and promote adherence to its tenets.

The meeting also established the group’s message ahead of an international conference on the declaration, which Norway is convening in Oslo next month. During the conference, the youth attendees will urge endorsing states to adopt an effective approach to implementing the declaration and to ensuring it meets the long-term needs of affected communities.

With the increased use of explosive weapons in towns and cities, youth participants will also call upon both states that have endorsed the declaration and those that have not to condemn all use of explosive weapons in populated areas as a moral imperative and a demonstration of solidarity with affected communities.",VERY HIGH,20240312T183000Z,youth advocates and participants from affected countries,participants of the seminar,states using explosive weapons,"Kyiv, Ukraine and other affected areas",adopt policies to avoid civilian harm and promote adherence to the declaration,Use of explosive weapons in populated areas causing civilian harm,Ukraine,modern-day conflicts and military strategies

In Pakistan, a WhatsApp message – even an alleged one – can have deadly consequences. Last week, a court in Gujrat district, Punjab, sentenced a 22-year-old student to death on charges of sharing blasphemous pictures and videos. A 17-year-old student was sentenced to life imprisonment in the same case because Pakistani law prohibits the death sentence for child offenders.

Blasphemy is an offense punishable by death in Pakistan. And although Pakistan’s blasphemy law has long been used abusively to carry out personal vendettas or prosecute members of minority religious communities, the increasing use of blasphemy provisions to jail and prosecute people for comments made on social media is a dangerous escalation.

However, the Punjab case is not first time that someone has been condemned to death over a social media post.

Aneeqa Atiq, 26, remains on death row after a court in Rawalpindi district sentenced her to death in January 2022, for allegedly sharing blasphemous material via WhatsApp. Junaid Hafeez, a university professor, has been imprisoned for more than 10 years and is facing a possible death sentence for accusations of sharing blasphemous material on Facebook. His lawyer, Rashid Rehman, was murdered in May 2014, an apparent reprisal for his willingness to defend people charged under Pakistan’s blasphemy laws.

In Pakistan, the mere accusation of blasphemy can put you at risk of physical harm. Since 1990, at least 65 people have reportedly been killed in Pakistan over claims of blasphemy. And on August 16, 2023, several hundred people attacked a Christian settlement in Faisalabad district, Punjab province, after two members of the community were accused of committing blasphemy.

Expanding the use of blasphemy cases against people for what they say or share on social media is an invitation for witch hunts.

(Washington, DC) – The International Monetary Fund (IMF) should urge Sri Lanka’s government to abandon draft legislation that would severely curtail civil society and jeopardize the IMF’s program in the country, Human Rights Watch said in a letter to the IMF that was released today. The proposed Non-Governmental Organizations (Registration and Supervision) Act is among several recent and planned measures that would curtail fundamental freedoms, despite the critical role of public scrutiny in promoting good governance and combatting corruption.

The IMF’s US$3 billion bailout of Sri Lanka – which is linked to government commitments to reform – helped stem the immediate economic crisis after the country defaulted on its foreign debt in 2022, but further progress is threatened by the adoption of laws by President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s administration that would severely restrict basic rights. The Online Safety Act, enacted in January, creates vague and broad speech-related offenses punishable with lengthy prison terms. The Anti-Terrorism Bill , currently before parliament, contains sweeping new speech-related offenses and arbitrary powers of arrest. And the draft law to regulate nongovernmental organizations could make independent civil society activity all but impossible in Sri Lanka.

“As the economy collapsed in 2022, Sri Lankans demanded good governance and an end to corruption, but instead now face draconian laws and policies that threaten human rights and undermine reforms,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The protests helped bring President Wickremesinghe to power, but instead of listening to calls for change, he’s clamping down on peaceful dissent.”

A 2023 IMF study of Sri Lanka known as the Governance Diagnostic Assessment stated that “[a]nticorruption efforts are unlikely to achieve their objectives unless they also encompass initiatives designed and led by groups outside of government who are committed to rule-based inclusive economic and social progress.” However, the study found that civil society’s participation in oversight and monitoring of government actions has been “restricted by limited transparency, the lack of platforms for inclusive and participatory governance, and by broad application of counter-terrorism rules.” As a result, “opportunities for public participation and oversight of official behaviour, including by civil society, are increasingly restricted.”

The government on January 30, 2024, provided the draft NGO law to selected members of civil society, who were given three weeks to respond. The bill does not address any evident need, but instead seeks to subject civil society organizations to invasive government scrutiny and interference, and threatens civil society members with prison if they don’t comply with cumbersome administrative procedures.

The National Collective of CSOs and NGOs, a coalition of Sri Lankan civil society organizations, wrote to the government on February 28 that the proposed law would “violate the fundamental rights to freedom of association and expression,” while damaging the delivery of services by civil society organizations, including to “the many families who are struggling to make ends meet in the midst of severe economic hardship.”

The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, in his March 1 update to the UN Human Rights Council on the crisis in Sri Lanka, said he was “concerned by the introduction of new or proposed laws with potentially far-reaching impact on fundamental rights and freedoms … which variously strengthen the executive, grant broad powers to the security forces, and severely restrict rights to freedom of assembly, association and expression, impacting not only on civic space but the business environment.”

The IMF should protect the credibility and efficacy of its program in Sri Lanka by publicly calling upon the government to abandon the proposed NGO law, impose a moratorium on use of the Online Safety Act, and amend the Anti-Terrorism Bill to ensure that it respects human rights standards, Human Rights Watch said.

“The IMF and other international partners supporting Sri Lanka’s economic recovery recognize that this crisis has its roots in misgovernance and corruption,” Ganguly said. “If their efforts are to be successful, they need to stand firm against the government’s attempts to curtail fundamental civil and political rights.”",HIGH,20240313T020000Z,Human Rights Watch,"President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Volker Türk",Sri Lankan government,Sri Lanka,IMF should call for abandonment of proposed NGO law and amend related legislation,Draft legislation to curtail civil society and basic rights,Sri Lanka,Misgovernance and corruption

This week, India’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government began implementing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which parliament had enacted in 2019. The law fast-tracks citizenship requests from non-Muslims fleeing religious persecution from India’s Muslim-majority neighbors – Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh – but excludes Muslim refugees from those countries.

Before the government enacted the law, Home Minister Amit Shah explained the BJP government’s broader plans for a proposed nationwide citizenship verification process, called the National Register of Citizens, that would identify irregular immigrants.

When the CAA was passed, thousands of people across India protested the law, fearing it could be used to disenfranchise Indian Muslims and strip them of their citizenship rights. They had reason to be alarmed: in Assam state, citizenship screening ultimately rendered stateless over a million people.

Indian authorities on Tuesday published a press release of questions and answers outlining the “positive narrative” of the law, but it was taken down hours later. The statement unconvincingly asserted that “Indian Muslims need not worry as CAA has not made any provision to impact their citizenship.”

Fearing further demonstrations, the authorities deployed a large number of security personnel in Delhi and Assam. Previously, police used excessive force to crush protests against the law, and communal clashes killed 53 people in New Delhi, most of them Muslim. The Supreme Court has yet to hear petitions challenging the amendments for religious bias and for violating fundamental rights.

The United Nations high commissioner for human rights expressed concern over the law, calling it a “breach of India’s international human rights obligations.” Several leaders from Indian opposition parties criticized the government for enforcing a law that fosters religious discrimination.

Over the years, India has provided protection for many people fleeing persecution. Those persecuted often are members of minority religious communities or ethnic groups, and India is doing right to welcome them. But members of the majority can also face persecution, such as Afghans at risk fleeing the Taliban.

India should demonstrate that it is genuinely committed to helping those whose lives or freedom are in danger by protecting all asylum seekers. It should ratify the Refugee Convention, establish nondiscriminatory refugee law and asylum procedures, and establish a path to citizenship for all recognized refugees without regard to their religion.",HIGH,20240315T141500Z,UN high commissioner for human rights,Home Minister Amit Shah,Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government,New Delhi and Assam,"Ratify the Refugee Convention, establish nondiscriminatory refugee law and asylum procedures, provide a path to citizenship for all recognized refugees",Enforcing a law that fosters religious discrimination,India,Religious persecution and fears of disenfranchisement of Muslims

This week, Ethiopian authorities dropped all charges and released Abdi Mohamoud Omar, also known as “Abdi Illey,” the former president of Ethiopia’s Somali region, after serving more than five years in prison. The action is a setback to ending impunity for crimes involving senior officials.

State media reported that Ethiopia’s Ministry of Justice took the action for the “sake of public interest.”

Federal officials initially arrested Abdi Illey in 2018 for “violations of human rights and inciting ethnic and religious conflict in the Somali region,” and charged him in 2019 for his role during his last days in office, when Somali youth groups loyal to him and Somali regional special forces, called the “Liyu police,” attacked non-Somali groups. The charges also covered the destruction of churches and property in the Somali regional capital of Jigjiga.

But the authorities never brought charges against Abdi Illey for crimes during his decade of abusive rule.

As regional security chief in 2006, and president from 2010-2018, Abdi Illey oversaw and commanded the Liyu police. Human Rights Watch documented that the Liyu police frequently committed serious rights abuses against civilians throughout the Somali region during counterinsurgency campaigns, including extrajudicial killings, torture, and rape, as well as reprisals against local communities.

In 2018, Human Rights Watch reported on the abuses during Abdi Illey’s rule, notably the pattern of torture and abuse in Ethiopia’s notorious Jail Ogaden, where prisoners were denied access to adequate medical care, family, lawyers, and at times, food. Former prisoners implicated Liyu police members, prison guards, and senior Somali region officials in rape, and widespread and routine torture, from which some detainees died. Abdi Illey himself was known to regularly visit the prison.

For victims of abuse under Abdi Illey’s rule, the decision to drop the charges is a devastating blow.

A 42-year-old former prisoner at Jail Ogaden told us: “We cannot forgive him for what he and his [Liyu] police have done to our people. He has destroyed a generation… He must face justice for what he has done.”

By failing to hold Abdi Illey to account for the many rights violations during his rule, the Ethiopian government is sending the message that impunity remains the order of the day.

With the government reportedly just weeks away from launching a nationwide transitional justice policy, the authorities need to reverse course and demonstrate a willingness to tackle accountability for serious abuses.",HIGH,20240315T214500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Abdi Illey, Liyu police, former prisoners",Abdi Mohamoud Omar (Abdi Illey),"Jail Ogaden, Somali regional capital of Jigjiga",Initiate accountability measures and address human rights abuses,"Violations of human rights, inciting ethnic and religious conflict",Ethiopia,Ethnic tensions and political conflict in the Somali region

Mr. President,

We thank the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan for their latest report and update.

We share the Commission’s concerns over “entrenched systematic repression,” including through media censorship, widespread restrictions on civic and political activities, and continued harassment of journalists and human rights defenders.

The authorities are still failing to provide accountability for grave abuses, allowing impunity to fuel further violence, as the Commission has repeatedly highlighted, with civilians bearing the brunt of widespread attacks, state-sponsored extrajudicial killings , systematic sexual violence against women and girls, and the participation of children in armed forces and armed groups.

For example, the authorities have never prosecuted officials accused of instigating and facilitating attacks on civilians and civilian property in villages in Leer, Koch, and Mayendit counties in early 2022, despite the president launching an investigation into these events.

The government has not met critical milestones set out by the 2018 peace agreement to advance accountability. No steps have been taken to establish a hybrid court, and legislation for the establishment of the Commission for Truth, Reconciliation and Healing and for the Compensation and Reparations Authority has yet to be presented before parliament.

In this context of continued impunity fuelling grave abuses, we appeal to members of this Council to support the renewal of the Commission’s mandate.

We would like to ask the Commission to elaborate further on the main obstacles in the justice system thwarting credible accountability for serious violations, including widespread sexual violence.

Thank you.",HIGH,20240301T173000Z,Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan,President of South Sudan,South Sudanese Authorities,"Leer, Koch, and Mayendit counties",Support the renewal of the Commission’s mandate and address obstacles in the justice system,"Systematic repression, media censorship, and failure to provide accountability for grave abuses",South Sudan,Entrenched systematic repression and impunity

Maryam al-Khawaja has spent nearly 13 years relentlessly campaigning for the release of her father, Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, a Danish-Bahraini human rights defender wrongfully serving a life sentence in Bahrain for his peaceful human rights work. In a heartbreaking message on February 19, Maryam announced she’s now also fighting cancer.

Those who know Maryam know that no one fights as fiercely as she does. In that way, she is her father’s daughter. Over the years, she has never given up on her quest for justice to see her father released from prison, where he still fights for his and others’ rights. Last August, he was among the many Bahraini political prisoners who started a hunger strike to protest their inhumane and degrading treatment. Fearing for her father’s life, Maryam tried to board a plane to Bahrain, knowing she risked arrest upon arrival. She and a delegation of leading human rights figures were prevented from boarding.

Unfortunately, neither the Danish government nor the European Union have shown similar determination in fighting for human rights in Bahrain.

Deeming Bahrain to be a “strategic partner” in the region, EU member states have been reluctant to indicate to the Danish government their readiness to support collective action against Bahrain and to make al-Khawaja’s case an “EU case.” Last year, following the prisoners’ hunger strike, EU member states finally agreed to mention Bahrain in a statement at the United Nations, but some EU governments were so reluctant that the final, negotiated language is borderline flattering to Bahrain’s autocratic rulers and includes no reference to political prisoners or their plight.

The Danish government has also been too timid in its actions, both to rally support within the EU and in confronting Bahraini authorities. Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke said on February 27 that he spoke about Khawaja’s case with Bahrain’s foreign minister, but was “not optimistic” about the outcome. He made no reference to what consequences Bahrain’s reluctance to release Khawaja and others will have on its relations with Denmark and the EU. And that’s precisely the problem.

Thirteen years of “private diplomacy” and “human rights dialogues” have done nothing to reunite Maryam and her father.

(New York) – Indian authorities are using threats, excessive force, and internet shutdowns to stop farmers from holding peaceful protests, Human Rights Watch said today. Since mid-February 2024, farmers from Punjab and Haryana states seeking higher prices for their produce have congregated outside India’s capital, New Delhi, to raise their demands.

The protests revive a year-long movement that ended in 2021 after tens of thousands of farmers camped outside New Delhi and obtained the repeal of new agricultural laws. The farmers’ current demands include an expanded list of 23 crops that the government would purchase at a minimum guaranteed price. To prevent the demonstrators from entering the city, the authorities have barricaded highways with cement blocks, metal containers, and barbed wire. Talks between the farmers and the government have been deadlocked.

“The Indian authorities have an obligation to uphold the right to peaceful protest, whoever is taking part and whatever the issue,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The authorities may not threaten or use force against the farmers to deny their right to express their views in a peaceful manner.”

India’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government has repeatedly cracked down on peaceful protests and arrested critics of government policies. In response to the farmers’ protest, the government has urged dialogue. However, the authorities have threatened to revoke demonstrators’ passports and visas, with a police official stating, “We have identified them with CCTV and drone cameras. We will request the ministry of home affairs and the embassy to cancel their visas and passports.”

The authorities also deployed drones and used tear gas shells to disperse gatherings and medical camps. They fired shotguns loaded with metal pellets, which can cause blindness and other serious injury, for crowd control. On February 21, Shubhkaran Singh, a 24-year old farmer, died of a bullet wound to the head after police repeatedly fired on protesting farmers in the area bordering Punjab and Haryana states.

The protesting farmers have taken several measures to counter security force actions, such as flying kites to distract drones, wearing swimming goggles to protect their eyes from tear gas, and using their tractors to pull down barricades.



The Haryana government imposed temporary restrictions on internet services in seven districts in an apparent attempt to disrupt the farmers’ protests, a tactic the Indian government often uses for political purposes. The Global Government Affairs team at X (formerly Twitter) stated that the Indian government issued “executive orders” requiring them to take down specific accounts on February 21. Most of these accounts, including some barred on Facebook, belong to journalists reporting on the protests, farmers union leaders, and others supporting the farmers’ actions.

India is obligated under international human rights law to ensure that internet-based restrictions are provided by law and are a necessary and proportionate response to a specific security concern. In July 2016, the United Nations Human Rights Council condemned measures to intentionally prevent or disrupt access to or dissemination of information online.

BJP supporters have used social media to describe the protesting farmers, many from the Sikh minority community, as “separatists,” a dangerous accusation. In West Bengal state, a BJP leader used a similar slur against a Sikh police officer, leading to strong condemnation by police officers and protests by the Sikh community. The authorities have repeatedly failed to hold to account BJP leaders and supporters who incite violence against religious minority communities, which communal divisions can escalate to a human rights crisis, Human Rights Watch said.

The Indian government should publicly direct the security forces to abide by the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials and take all other necessary steps to ensure that the forces act with restraint, Human Rights Watch said. Protest organizers should take steps to deter their supporters from engaging in violence against members of the public and law enforcement officers.

The 2020 UN guidance on “less-lethal weapons” in law enforcement says, “Multiple projectiles fired at the same time are inaccurate and, in general, their use cannot comply with the principles of necessity and proportionality. Metal pellets, such as those fired from shotguns, should never be used.”

“As India heads into elections, it’s critical for the BJP-led government to act to minimize rather than exacerbate political violence,” Pearson said. “A genuine commitment to human rights and democracy means providing room for dissent, peaceful protest, and political disagreement.”",HIGH,20240301T063000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Shubhkaran Singh (farmer, victim of police violence), Elaine Pearson (Asia director at Human Rights Watch)",Indian authorities/BJP-led government,"Border between Punjab and Haryana states, near New Delhi","Abide by UN principles on use of force, protect the right to peaceful protest.","Use of excessive force, internet shutdowns, and threats to suppress peaceful protests",India,"Government crackdowns on dissent, political motivations behind protests"

A new wave of deadly attacks in the northern Mozambican province of Cabo Delgado by an armed group linked to the Islamic State (ISIS) is forcing thousands of people to flee. The attacks, by fighters known as Al-Shabab or Mashababos, include raids on villages in Chiure district, where at least four civilians were killed, and a clash in Macomia district, in which 25 Mozambican soldiers died.

Officials estimate that over 67,000 people have fled from villages across Cabo Delgado’s southern districts in the past two months, many to the neighboring province of Nampula, where the government has set up camps. The United Nations reported that those who have fled urgently need assistance and protection. Mozambican authorities should work with humanitarian agencies to ensure camps have adequate shelter, sanitation, and access to food, clean drinking water, health care, and education.

The armed group also destroyed houses, churches, schools, and health centers, according to media reports. This puts pressure on already degraded public services in the region, which has been engulfed in an armed conflict between the ISIS-linked group and regionally backed government forces since October 2017.

The government has downplayed the insurgents’ threat, insisting that the security forces, which are backed by troops from Rwanda and countries of the Southern African Development Community, have the situation under control. But recent events show that people in Cabo Delgado are far from being safe even in places previously considered secure and able to accommodate those displaced by the conflict.

(Nairobi) – The killing of a potential presidential candidate during an assault by Chadian security forces on an opposition party headquarters raises serious concerns about the environment for elections scheduled for May 6, 2024, Human Rights Watch said today.



On February 28, members of the security forces killed Yaya Dillo, the president of the Socialist Party Without Borders (Parti socialiste sans frontières, PSF), during an attack on the party’s headquarters in N’Djamena, the country’s capital. The state prosecutor, Oumar Mahamat Kedelaye, said at a news conference that Dillo was killed during an exchange of gunfire with security forces.

“The circumstances of Yaya Dillo’s killing are unclear, but his violent death highlights the dangers facing opposition politicians in Chad, particularly as elections approach,” said Lewis Mudge, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “The prime minister and other key national figures should publicly call for an independent investigation into his death with an eye toward ensuring greater accountability before the election.”



Dillo, 49, was considered a leading political opponent of the current transitional president, Gen. Mahamat Idriss Déby Itno. The two men are reported to be cousins from the same Zaghawa ethnic group. While Dillo had not announced his intention to run for president, he was widely reported to be preparing to do so.



Earlier in the week, on February 27 into February 28, a high-ranking PSF member, Ahmed Torabi, was reported by the media to have been arrested for trying to assassinate the president of the supreme court. Some media outlets stated that Torabi had actually been killed by the security forces. The government alleged that PSF members attacked an office of the national security agency, which responded by attacking the party headquarters on February 28. Before he was killed, Dillo told Agence France-Presse that the claimed assassination attempt was staged and that his party members never attacked the security agency.



Human Rights Watch reviewed several photos sent by a reliable source close to Dillo, showing him dead with a single bullet wound to his head.



The day Dillo was killed marked three years since security forces attacked his home, on February 28, 2021, killing his 80-year-old mother and injuring five other family members.



Internet services across N’Djamena were cut following the attack and remained off through February 29, 2024, making communication with the capital very difficult.



The lack of clarity surrounding the attack on the PSF headquarters, the threats previously faced by Dillo, and the general political repression in the country all point to the need for an independent investigation with foreign assistance into the February 28, 2024 events, Human Rights Watch said.



Since President Idriss Déby’s death in April 2021, the transitional government headed by Déby’s son, Gen. Mahamat Idriss Déby Itno, has on several occasions carried out violent crackdowns on opposition-led protests demanding civilian democratic rule and on independent media.



On October 20, 2022, security forces fired live ammunition at protesters during demonstrations organized by civil society groups and opposition parties, killing and injuring scores, and beating and chasing people into their homes. Hundreds of men and boys were arrested, and many were taken to Koro Toro, a high security prison 600 kilometers from N’Djamena. Several detainees died en route, some due to lack of water. At Koro Toro, protesters suffered further abuse, including ill-treatment by other detainees, and some died. The detainees were held for months and eventually released or pardoned. Chadian authorities refused to carry out prompt, effective, and impartial criminal investigations into the violations.



On November 23, 2023, the national transitional council passed an amnesty law that removed the possibility of prosecuting security forces or others responsible for serious violations, including killings against participants in the October 20 demonstrations, enshrining impunity and rewarding the abusers.



Dillo’s killing comes a week after the government’s removal of the president of the National Human Rights Commission (Commission nationale des droits de l'homme, CNDH), the only government institution willing to publish an accurate accounting of the deadly October 20 crackdown. Succès Masra, the current prime minister and president of Les Transformateurs – the political party whose members made up the bulk of the political detainees and victims after the October 20, 2022 protests – expressed his “total and unconditional support to the Head of State” in a February 28 tweet.



The president of the African Union, in a February 29 statement, expressed his concern over events in Chad, but did not call for an investigation.



“The African Union should take the lead in calling for an independent investigation into Yaya Dillo’s death and offer to provide assistance,” Mudge said. “A transparent reckoning of the circumstances surrounding Yaya Dillo’s death is needed to reassure Chadians of all political persuasions that the transitional government is committed to holding free and fair elections in May.”

(Beirut) – Jordan should ensure accountability for airstrikes in southeast Syria that killed 10 people on January 18 and compensate the victims and their families, Human Rights Watch said today. The strikes, which killed women and children, appear to amount to extrajudicial executions.

The airstrikes were part of an intensified campaign by the Jordanian Armed Forces against drug and weapons traffickers following recent clashes on its border with armed groups reportedly carrying narcotics, arms, and explosives that it suspects are tied to pro-Iranian militias. On January 23, the Syrian government responded, saying there was no justification for Jordan’s attacks. The Jordanian Foreign Ministry retorted , neither denying nor confirming the attacks, but emphasizing the threat posed by drug and weapons smuggling, its impact on Jordan’s national security, and the lack of effective action by the Syrian government to combat such operations in its territory. Human Rights Watch wrote to Jordan's Foreign Minister on January 31 detailing its findings, but received no response as of the time of publication.

“Cross-border airstrikes that kill civilians demand scrutiny regardless of the threat posed by drug smuggling from southern Syria,” said Adam Coogle, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. “Jordan should halt military strikes against non-military targets and compensate victims of previous attacks and their families.”

On January 18, at around 1 a.m., airstrikes on the town of Orman in the southern governorate of Sweida struck a house in the eastern part of the town, destroying the house and killing its owner, Omar Talab; his mother, Amal Zein Eldin; and his aunt, Etihad Talab. 500 meters west, two munitions struck two of four connected houses in the center of the town, causing significant damage and killing the owner of one of the houses, Turki al-Halabi; his wife, Fatin Abu Shahin; and their two young daughters, 3-year-old Farah and 5-year-old Dima. It also killed their relatives Nazih al-Halabi, who owned another one of the houses, his wife Iqbal, and a relative, Roza al-Halabi. Three of the four connected houses belong to the al-Halabi family.

Human Rights Watch interviewed two relatives of the al-Halabi family who live nearby, and an activist and researcher at the local Suwayda24 news website. Researchers reviewed and confirmed photos, videos, and satellite imagery showing extensive damage to both sites, as well as photos of remnants collected from the site of the four connected houses that housed members of the al-Halabi family.

These photos, alongside evidence of a large crater, allowed for a positive identification of one of the weapons used: a 500lb-class JDAM satellite guided bomb. Jordan acquired 198 JDAM kits from the United States in February 2017.

“At 1 a.m., I was at home in Orman,” said one relative. “I was with my wife and newborn girl. We heard warplanes and then a very big explosion nearby.

The relative said that he immediately went outside to see what happened and found the road to Turki al-Halabi’s house, 65 meters away, damaged and “full of rocks.” He said that when he reached Turki’s house, he found it demolished with extensive damage to the two houses next to it. His own house, he said, had a broken window.

The relative said that al-Halabi family is a well-known Druze family in Sweida governorate. He said that Turki al-Halabi works in agriculture and Nazih al-Halabi, a retired colonel, often participated in Sweida’s recent demonstrations for political reform. He said that neither men were involved in drug trafficking. Human Rights Watch could not independently verify this.

“We couldn’t tell how many times we had been attacked,” said the other relative, who lived across the street from the compound. “The fear, the sound, the dust and the screams of the kids, it was terrifying… All our windows were broken. When we saw what happened to my uncle’s house, we were terrified, a total collapse. Around an hour later, we were able to rescue Nazih’s children, all four of them were still alive.”

According to Suwayda24, search and rescue operations in Orman lasted over 10 hours. One of the al-Halabi relatives pointed to a lack of access to legal avenues in Syria by which they can seek answers and justice. “Sweida is left behind,” he said. “The government wants nothing to do with us.”

The January 18 attacks were not the first Jordan is suspected of carrying out against alleged drug smuggling operations in southern Syria. At least five other attacks have been reported, the first on May 8, 2023. That strike targeted a home where Merie al-Ramthan, a local man widely believed to be heavily involved in the illegal drug trade, and his family were staying in al-Shaab village in Sweida governorate. The strike, which was investigated and reported by the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) , killed al-Ramthan, his wife, and five children.

A statement from the Jordanian Foreign Ministry a few hours after the strike noted that the Jordanian and Syrian governments had reached an agreement to form a joint security force aimed at combatting the threat of drug trafficking and that the two governments had established communication lines. According to Suwayda24, three of the other four reported attacks killed nine people, including two children under the age of five. Jordan has neither claimed nor denied any of these attacks.

On January 16, just over a week after a round of airstrikes on a house and farm in Sweida governorate that killed three people, the spiritual leader of the Druze community in southern Syria, Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri, expressed his support for Jordan’s anti-trafficking operations, but implored Jordanian authorities to avoid civilian casualties and material losses.

On January 20, the Men of Dignity movement, the largest armed group in the governorate, publicly proposed a nine-point initiative to Jordanian authorities that would involve cooperation on issues relating to combatting drug trafficking, holding the Syrian government directly responsible for the issue, and outlining their willingness to pursue individuals involved in drug trafficking, following the Jordanian side’s sharing of lists naming those implicated. The movement also called for a halt to military operations against civilian sites, transparent investigations into deaths from the strikes, and compensation for damages.

On January 7, a day after the Jordanian army said it killed five drug and weapon smugglers and arrested 15 during clashes with armed groups of smugglers on its border with Syria, Media Director for the Jordanian Armed Forces Brigadier-General Mustafa al-Hiyari said in an interview with state-owned al-Mamlaka news agency, “the armed forces will use force as necessary and by all means to prevent the threat to Jordan’s national security.”

The right to life is an inherent human right that cannot be compromised, even in times of armed conflict or state of emergency. Summary, extrajudicial, or arbitrary executions are prohibited under international law, including under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The United Nations Manual on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions says that the duty to investigate is “triggered” not only in a clear case of an unlawful death, but also where there are “reasonable allegations of a potentially unlawful death,” even without a formal complaint. Family members should also have the right to full information about the circumstances and causes of the deaths and to participate in the investigation.

Jordan should ensure thorough and impartial investigations into the January 18 airstrike and previous strikes, including to establish how and with whom any policy originated, and ensure that those responsible for the violations are held accountable, Human Rights Watch said. Victims’ families should be compensated for the unlawful killings. Jordan’s international partners that provide military and security assistance should ensure that no funds or support they provide are used for unlawful killings or other human rights abuses.

(New York) – Indian authorities are revoking visa privileges to overseas critics of Indian origin who have spoken out against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government’s policies, Human Rights Watch said today. Prime Minister Narendra Modi often attends mass gatherings of diaspora party supporters in the United States, Europe, Australia, and elsewhere to celebrate Indian democracy, while his government has targeted people it claims are “tarnishing the image” of the country.

The Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) status is available to foreign citizens of Indian origin or foreigners married to Indian nationals to obtain broad residency rights and bypass visa requirements, but does not amount to citizenship. Many of those whose OCI visa status was revoked are Indian-origin academics, activists, and journalists who have been vocal critics of the BJP’s Hindu majoritarian ideology. Some have challenged their exclusion in Indian courts on constitutional grounds seeking protection of their rights to speech and livelihood.

“Indian government reprisals against members of the diaspora who criticize the BJP’s abusive and discriminatory policies show the authorities’ growing hostility to criticism and dialogue,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The authorities seem intent on expanding politically motivated repression against Indian activists and academics at home to foreign citizens of Indian origin beyond India’s borders.”

The BJP-led government has in recent years become more cautious about the visa status for overseas Indians. In 2021, the government downgraded the privileges of the 4.5 million OCI cardholders by re-categorizing them as “foreign nationals,” and requiring them to seek special permission to carry out research and journalism, or visit any area in India listed as “protected.”

Over the past decade, the government has canceled over 100 permits and deported some status holders for allegedly showing “disaffection towards the Constitution.” This has heightened concerns for OCI cardholders whether living in India or abroad, many of whom have older parents and other strong personal ties to India.

In 2022, after the authorities revoked his status, Ashok Swain, an Indian-origin Swedish academic, appealed to the Delhi High Court, which quashed the order, stating that the government had not provided any reasons for its action. In July 2023, the Indian consulate in Sweden sent Swain a fresh order canceling his OCI status because of his social media posts “hurting religious sentiments” and “attempting to destabilize the social fabric of India,” without providing specific evidence to substantiate those allegations.

When Swain challenged the order in September 2023, the authorities claimed they had received “secret” inputs from security agencies. In February 2024, Swain’s X (formerly Twitter) account was blocked in India and subsequently hacked.

“My case has been used as an example to scare or to force other academics outside India to not be critical of the regime,” Swain told Human Rights Watch. “They want to create fear because people want the opportunity to go back to the country.”

Indian authorities have also prevented academics who are OCI cardholders from entering the country. On February 23, the authorities barred Nitasha Kaul, a British professor at the University of Westminster in London, from entering India to attend a conference on the constitution. Kaul said immigration authorities did not provide any reasons but a Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson later said in response to questions about her case that “the entry of foreign nationals into our country is a sovereign decision.” Unidentified government officials also told the media that Kaul had “shown animus” toward India, which she has denied. Kaul has been a vocal critic of the BJP and its affiliated groups, and in 2019 she testified before the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs about human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir.

Kaul told Human Rights Watch that she has received numerous rape and death threats online from pro-BJP trolls in India and overseas. “In addition to this, they have called me jihadi and a terrorist,” she said. “There has been a vast amount of deliberate disinformation suggesting that because my work is critical of the ruling party in India, that makes me pro-Pakistani.”

In some cases, the authorities have openly cited criticism of BJP government policies as evidence to revoke the visa status. In response to a petition by a British activist, Amrit Wislon, challenging her cancellation, the government cited her social media posts about Kashmir and her article condemning the police’s excessive use of force against protesting farmers in 2020 and 2021.

Indian authorities are increasingly using what appear to be politically motivated tactics against the around 25 foreign reporters with OCI status working in India as of January 2024, embroiling them in opaque bureaucracy or simply denying them permission to continue reporting.

Vanessa Dougnac, a French journalist who had lived in India for 22 years, said she left the country after the Ministry of Home Affairs sent her a “show cause” notice in January, saying it intended to cancel her OCI card because she did not have a permit to work as a journalist and her news reports created a “biased negative perception of India.” Dougnac was denied permission to work as a journalist in 2022, and said the ministry had not responded to her “repeated requests” for an explanation or review of its decision.

In 2023, the authorities revoked the OCI status of an American journalist shortly after the journalist published a report about criminal actions by an Indian company. The journalist, who did not wish to be identified, told Human Rights Watch: “No specific allegation was made against me, and no evidence has been produced despite several requests.”

In 2022, the authorities deported the American-Sikh journalist Angad Singh. After Singh brought a lawsuit challenging the decision, the government told the Delhi High Court that he “presented a very negative view of India’s secular credentials” in a 2020 documentary about the 2019-20 protests against the country’s amended citizenship law.

Foreign writers, journalists, academics, and activists have been increasingly denied access to India for seemingly political reasons, Human Rights Watch said. In March 2022, British anthropologist Filippo Osella, who had visited India regularly for over 30 years, was turned away by immigration authorities despite holding a valid research visa. Others denied entry include an Australian writer, Kathryn Hummel; a Pakistani academic, Annie Zaman; a former Swiss diplomat and activist, Kurt Vogele; Mukunda Raj Kattel, director of Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development; and Aaron Gray-Block and Ben Hargreaves, both Greenpeace activists.

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which India is a party, addresses in article 13 the rights of aliens lawfully in a country, and non-discrimination against “all persons,” including non-nationals, in article 26. The Covenant does not recognize non-nationals having a right to enter or reside in a country, a decision left to the state. However, the United Nations Human Rights Committee, the international expert body that monitors compliance with the ICCPR, has stated in its General Comment No. 15 on the status of aliens, that, “in certain circumstances an alien may enjoy the protection of the Covenant even in relation to entry or residence, for example, when considerations of non-discrimination … arise.”

The General Comment further provides that if the legality of an alien's “stay is in dispute, any decision on this point leading to his expulsion or deportation ought to be taken in accordance with article 13. It is for the competent authorities … in good faith and in the exercise of their powers, to apply and interpret the domestic law, observing, however, such requirements under the Covenant as equality before the law” in accordance with article 26. Distinctions are permissible only when based on reasonable and objective criteria.

“Foreign governments eager to partner with India on trade and security should take note that the Indian government is increasing repression to hide a deteriorating human rights situation,” Pearson said. “These governments should press the Modi administration to interact with its critics to bring about reform instead of intimidating them into silence.”",HIGH,20240318T030000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Nitasha Kaul, Ashok Swain, Vanessa Dougnac, Angad Singh",Indian government,"India, diaspora communities abroad",Foreign governments should engage with Indian critics and press for reforms,Revoking visa privileges of overseas critics of the BJP-led government,India,Ruling BJP's Hindu majoritarian ideology and hostility to criticism

Are you a brutal dictator short of cash or maybe just looking for a side hustle? Is crushing your critics not having the economic benefit you’d hoped for? Would you like to get paid more for your repression?

The European Union is offering huge piles of cash to authoritarians just like you! We’ve got mountains of money – big notes, small notes, sacks of coins – all to help you strengthen your hold on power and continue your repression for decades to come!

Just pick up the phone and call EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen now! Join the EU’s many satisfied customers, like Egypt’s autocratic leader, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Von der Leyen and friends handed him EUR 7.4 billion yesterday.

And all al-Sisi has to do in return is say the words “comprehensive and strategic partnership” and – most importantly – promise to prevent migrant departures toward Europe.

And Egypt is not alone. Mauritania and Tunisia have also walked away smiling from the EU’s ATM for autocrats. It’s very simple: you promise to stop the migrants, you get the cash.

How are you supposed to stop them? EU leaders don’t care! Do whatever you want! Are you worried about so-called “European values” of democracy and human rights? Well, don’t be!

In Egypt, authorities wrongfully arrest and mistreat migrants, asylum seekers, and refugees. They deport them to Eritrea, an even more repressive country. They also reportedly deported Sudanese asylum seekers back to Sudan, where there’s a war raging. None of this stopped the EU handing al-Sisi the money. It’s almost as if mistreatment of migrants is the whole point… Wink, wink.

Plus, if you act now, the EU will throw in at no extra cost to you a free set of silences about other horrific human rights abuses in your dictatorship.

After yesterday, you can bet Brussels won’t be saying much about the al-Sisi regime’s long list of crimes since he took power in a 2013 coup. Massacring protesters, jailing and torturing thousands of critics and opponents, grossly unfair trials, crushed media, the courts an obedient arm of government repression.

So, dictators of the world, what are you waiting for? Billions of euros could be yours! Phone today! The EU is waiting for your call!

I know: it’s not funny. These so-called leaders of Europe are behaving in the most appalling manner. They fear and despise desperate people fleeing war and oppression so much, they are literally paying brutal dictators to abuse them just so the desperate people don’t reach Europe.

“They held him there to send a message to the rest of us: be careful, or else.” A human rights activist from the Central African Republic said this to Human Rights Watch after Crépin Mboli Goumba, a prominent political opponent, was arrested and sent to a police unit notorious for torture, executions, and shooting suspects on sight.

On March 3, Mboli Goumba was arrested on charges of contempt of court after a press conference during which he accused four judges and the minister of justice of corruption, offering documentation to support his accusations and asking authorities to investigate.

Instead of a police station in the city, Mboli Goumba was taken to the headquarters of the Central Office for the Repression of Banditry (Office Central de Répression du Banditisme, OCRB), a police unit created in the late 1990s to address a rise in banditry that developed a notorious reputation for abuse. In 2016, Human Rights Watch released a report outlining how members of the OCRB unlawfully executed at least 18 people and possibly more between April 2015 and March 2016.

For the past two years the Central African Republic’s ruling party, the United Hearts Movement (Mouvement Cœurs Unis) and its supporters have waged a crackdown on civil society, media, and the political opposition. Since the idea for a constitutional referendum to remove presidential term limits first surfaced in 2022, governmental institutions, including police, have threatened civil society advocates, accused them of collaborating with armed groups, and prevented opposition protests.

Mboli Goumba was not mistreated at the OCRB, but if convicted, he could face up to 2 years in prison. He told Human Rights Watch that OCRB officials said his case was “tied to politics.”

Mboli Goumba was provisionally released on March 6 and had his first appearance in court last week.

This year, at the United Nations’ top human rights body in Geneva, there are signs of a potential giant leap forward, with growing hopes for new legal recognition of every child’s right to free education, from pre-primary through secondary education.

On March 20, the Dominican Republic, along with other states including Luxembourg, Sierra Leone, Colombia, Panama, Nauru, Bulgaria, and Romania, together with Human Rights Watch, Plan International, and Girls Not Brides will convene countries at the Human Rights Council to discuss the immediate need for a new legal instrument. They will emphasize the critical intersection between free preprimary and secondary education and human rights, with a particular focus on empowering girls and women.

Globally, nearly half of all children are not enrolled in preprimary education, with only 2 in 5 children in low- and lower-middle-income countries attending such programs. Additionally, only 45 percent of children completed secondary school in 2021. For too many children, the cost of preprimary and secondary education remains a significant barrier to attendance. Global failure to universalize free access to the full cycle of education perpetuates poverty and inequality and hinders societal progress and development.

Yet many low- and middle-income countries are making significant strides to provide more free education. Countries like Kyrgyzstan, Madagascar, Nepal, and Sierra Leone, among at least 110 worldwide, have legislation that guarantees at least one year of free preprimary education and free secondary education.

But international human rights law has not kept pace with this progress. For example, the UN’s children’s rights treaty , the Convention on the Rights of the Child , does not obligate states to provide free secondary education on the same immediate basis as primary education, nor does it explicitly reference early childhood education. This discrepancy is spurring growing global support for enshrining these rights into a new legal instrument, a fourth optional protocol to the convention. In turn, new international law could propel further implementation of free education in countries where fees are still charged.

It is imperative that other states rally behind this initiative. Together, they can guarantee that every child can learn and fulfill their potential, laying the groundwork for a more just and equitable future.",HIGH,20240318T043000Z,Human Rights Watch,Bede Sheppard,United Nations,"United Nations, Geneva",States should enshrine the right to free education in law and support new international legal instruments,Lack of legal recognition for every child's right to free education,Uzbekistan,"Poverty, inequality, high costs of education"

Fighting has intensified across much of the country, displacing 2.4 million people since the coup.

The number of people needing assistance has grown from 1 million before the coup to 18.6 million today, amid spiraling atrocities and countrywide economic and infrastructure collapse. The UN estimates that 10,000 children under age 5 died last year due to lack of treatment for malnutrition.

Yet the junta has only ramped up its deadly blocking of humanitarian aid as a method of collective punishment of the population. These blockages sustain the military’s longstanding “four cuts” strategy, designed to maintain control of an area by isolating and terrorizing civilians.

The conflict is now increasingly impacting regional peace and security, spilling over into China, India, Bangladesh, and elsewhere in Southeast Asia.

The military’s crimes against humanity and war crimes are fueled by decades of impunity and meager international efforts to stop the violations. Much more needs to be done.

The 2022 Security Council resolution—presented as a first step to further action—has instead become the feeble peak of council activity on a country in harrowing crisis.

Oxfam, an international humanitarian and development organization, and Human Rights Watch, an international human rights organization, together write to you to demonstrate that any such assurances from the Israeli government, a major recipient of US arms, are not credible, especially in light of the conduct of Israeli forces since the onset of hostilities in October 2023.

Oxfam and Human Rights Watch have observed or documented that the Israeli authorities have carried out indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks in violation of international humanitarian law following the Hamas-led October 7 attacks in Israel, imposed collective punishments on the civilian population, deprived the civilian population of objects indispensable to its survival, and used starvation of civilians as a weapon of war. These are all grave violations of the Fourth Geneva Convention and customary international humanitarian law. The vast majority of Gaza’s population has also been forced to flee their homes, many as a result of Israeli actions that amount to war crimes.

Israeli authorities have also restricted, delayed, and impeded US-origin humanitarian assistance in contravention of US laws and policy. This memorandum addresses instances of apparent and prima facie violations of international law and restrictions on aid based on our firsthand experience or investigations, with supporting information from credible news organizations. Given the widespread insecurity in Gaza and the Israeli government’s restrictions on the entry of foreign investigators, journalists, and aid workers, we believe that the examples we cite here reflect a broader pattern of conduct than is currently being assessed by the US Government.

In November, Human Rights Watch called for states to suspend military assistance and arms sales to Israel as long as its forces commit widespread, systematic abuses against Palestinian civilians with impunity, warning that states that continue to provide arms risk complicity in war crimes. In January, Oxfam joined with 15 international humanitarian and human rights organization to call for a halt to the transfer of weapons, parts, and ammunition to Israel and Palestinian armed groups where there is a risk that they will be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international humanitarian or human rights law.

We urge Secretaries Blinken and Austin to consider the likely violations below when determining the credibility of the Israeli government’s assurances in response to NSM-20. Oxfam and Human Rights Watch believe a suspension of arms transfers to Israel is necessary so long as there is an overriding risk that they are being used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, and US law and policy.

Violations of International Humanitarian Law

Human Rights Watch documented a strike by Israeli forces on a marked ambulance outside al-Shifa Hospital on November 3, 2023, which reportedly killed 15 people and injured 60.[1] Ambulances are protected civilian objects under international humanitarian law and cannot be targeted when used to treat wounded and sick individuals, both civilian and combatant. Israeli authorities said they intentionally struck the ambulance, contending that it was being used to transport able-bodied fighters. Human Rights Watch investigated these claims and did not find any evidence that the ambulance was being used for military purposes. Furthermore, the high number of civilian casualties caused by the strike suggest that it was unlawfully disproportionate even if the ambulance was being used for military purposes. Human Rights Watch documented strikes on or near several major hospitals between October 7 and November 7, including the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, the Indonesian Hospital, and the International Eye Care Center.[2] Hospitals enjoy protected status under international humanitarian law, and only lose their protection from attack if used to commit “acts harmful to the enemy,” though warnings, proportionality, and distinction are still required.[3] Israel contends that the hospitals were being used by Palestinian fighters and therefore were not protected under international humanitarian law. Human Rights Watch found with respect to the cases it investigated no evidence that would justify depriving the hospitals of their protected status under international humanitarian law.[4] Human Rights Watch determined based on verified video and witness accounts that Israeli forces used white phosphorus in military operations in Lebanon and Gaza on October 10 and 11, 2023, respectively. White phosphorus, which can be used either for marking, signaling, and obscuring, or as a weapon, has a significant incendiary effect that can severely burn people and set structures, fields, and other civilian objects in the vicinity on fire. The use of white phosphorus in densely populated areas of Gaza violates the requirement under international humanitarian law to take all feasible precautions to avoid civilian injury and loss of life. In Lebanon, the Ministry of Environment has said that at least 6.82 square kilometers of land were burned in attacks by Israeli forces, including as a result of white phosphorous. An investigation by the Washington Post found that the Israeli military used US-supplied white phosphorus munitions in an attack that injured nine civilians and that Amnesty International said should be investigated as a war crime.[5] Human Rights Watch verified the US origins of the munitions used in this attack. Human Rights Watch documented two strikes by Israeli forces in southern Lebanon on October 13, which killed one journalist and injured six others, including a US citizen.[6] According to Human Rights Watch’s investigation, the strikes on October 13 “were apparently deliberate attacks on civilians, which is a war crime.”[7] Relying on video evidence, expert audio analysis, and witness accounts, Human Rights Watch’s investigation found that the group was visible to the cameras of a nearby unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that was most likely Israeli, within line of sight of five Israeli surveillance towers, and most likely targeted by at least one munition fired from the main gun of a tank from an Israeli military position approximately 1.5 kilometers southeast. Human Rights Watch’s investigation found that the Israeli military knew or should have known that the group of people they were firing on were civilians. Human Rights Watch documented a strike by Israeli forces on a family in a car in southern Lebanon on November 5 that killed three girls, ages 10, 12 and 14, and their grandmother.[8] Human Rights Watch found no evidence of a military target in the vicinity of the car that was struck, which only contained fleeing civilians. According to Human Rights Watch, the attack on the car showed “reckless disregard by the Israeli military for its obligation to distinguish between civilian and military objects and a significant failure to take adequate safeguards to prevent civilian deaths.”[9] An Oxfam analysis has found that a significant portion of its water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure that Oxfam and its WASH partners installed or rehabilitated over the period 2017-2023 has been damaged or destroyed by Israeli bombardment, rendering much of it inoperable. The locations of this infrastructure were deconflicted through the appropriate channels in order to ensure that Israel was aware of and could avoid damaging facilities that provide essential services to civilians in Gaza. Targeting humanitarian infrastructure is a violation of the principle of distinction, which requires Israel to distinguish between civilian objects and military targets, as well as the principle of precaution, which requires Israel to take all feasible measures to avoid incidental damage to civilian infrastructure. Human Rights Watch and Oxfam believe that Israeli forces’ use of explosive weapons with wide-area affects in populated areas of Gaza raises significant concerns over Israel’s compliance with the international humanitarian law principles of distinction and proportionality. As of mid-December, reports indicate that around half of all munitions dropped on Gaza were unguided “dumb bombs.”[10] Israel routinely uses 2,000-pound bombs on densely populated areas in Gaza. According to the Washington Post, Israeli forces dropped over 22,000 US-origin munitions on Gaza during the first 45 days of the hostilities.[11] The United States has reportedly transferred at least 5,000 2,000-pound “dumb bombs” to Israel since October 7.[12]

Intentional Deprivation of Services Critical for the Survival of the Population

On October 9, 2023, Yoav Gallant, Israel’s Minister of Defense, stated, “We are imposing a complete siege on [Gaza]. No electricity, no food, no water, no fuel – everything is closed. We are fighting human animals, and we act accordingly.”[13] That evening, Israeli authorities cut off all water entering Gaza through the three Mekorot pipelines. On the day of the Hamas-led attacks on Israel, October 7, Israel cut the electricity that it supplies to Gaza, which is the main source of electricity in the enclave.[14] As of March 19, Israeli authorities continued to block electricity to Gaza. Israel has also largely continued to block the entry of fuel to Gaza since then. The only power plant in Gaza ran out of fuel reserves by October 11.[15] In the absence of electricity, water and wastewater facilities in Gaza became inoperable once there was no fuel available to operate diesel generators. According to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, as of February 16, water production in Gaza stood at just 5.7% of what it was before the current hostilities.[16] The lack of potable water, as well the damage and destruction of sewage and wastewater infrastructure,[17] has led to the outbreak of diseases, including Hepatitis A and diarrhea,[18] as well as cases of severe dehydration.[19] The lack of water for cleaning, as well as the breakdown of sanitation infrastructure and resulting contamination of the environment, has also been a major cause of disease outbreaks. International humanitarian law requires Israel, as the occupying power in Gaza, to ensure that the basic needs of the civilian population are provided for. This is a positive obligation that requires Israel to also protect Palestinians’ right to water and take “deliberate, concrete, and targeted” measures to ensure the full realization of these rights. Depriving a population from access to water amounts to collective punishment of the civilian population, a war crime. The right to water, which includes the right to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation, is also human right, and is derived from the right to life[20] and the right to an adequate standard of living.[21]

Banditry and insurgency are plaguing northern Nigeria from east to west, and a fresh wave of mass kidnappings seems to show authorities are unable to protect people.

Just yesterday, more than 87 people were reportedly abducted in Kajuru community in Kaduna State.

On March 9, criminal gangs known as “bandits” attacked a boarding school in Gidan Bakuso village in Sokoto State and kidnapped 15 children as they slept.

Two days before that, bandits abducted 287 students, including many girls, at the government secondary school in Kuriga town, in Kaduna State.

On February 29, more than 200 internally displaced people were abducted, many of them children, in the Ngala Local Government Area of Borno State. The perpetrator in that case is believed to be the Islamist insurgent group Boko Haram.

It’s a spate of truly alarming attacks. The overall insecurity it reveals is frightening, and it’s hard to even imagine the terror the abductees – so many of them just kids – must be suffering and the overwhelming distress of their families worrying about them back home.

It’s not exactly new, of course, such mass abductions have been a problem across northern Nigeria since Boko Haram abducted 276 schoolgirls from Chibok in 2014. That atrocity sparked the #BringBackOurGirls movement, which received massive international attention.

Still, the recent wave of mass kidnappings is shocking, and the key question remains: where are the authorities? Why can’t they protect people from bandits and insurgents?

Government security forces say they are working to obtain the safe release of those abducted. Bandits sometimes demand ransoms be paid, but authorities are loathe to do so, not wanting to reward banditry and encourage even more. Security forces also highlight the difficulties reaching the remote forest areas where the victims are being held.

Assuring their safe release is essential, of course, but Nigerian authorities also face what’s perhaps an even greater challenge: preventing more kidnappings, particularly of vulnerable students, without frustrated security forces engaging in abuses against those they are rescuing, as they’ve done in the past.

Ultimately, what may be most critical in ending these horrific mass abductions in northern Nigeria – and stopping the abuses seen in security forces’ responses to them – is, as my expert colleague Anietie Ewang says, holding the perpetrators to account.

Eight Tamil Hindu worshippers arrested by Sri Lankan police while engaging in festival rituals last week were detained for more than 10 days and allegedly abused. A magistrate released them on March 19.

In recent years, Sri Lankan government authorities and nationalist Sinhala Buddhist monks have been targeting Hindu as well as Muslim religious sites in the country’s north and east in violation of the right to freedom of religion and belief, among other basic rights.

The eight were arrested at the Veddukkunaari temple near Vavuniya, a Hindu shrine that Buddhist monks, backed by the government’s Department of Archaeology, say is an ancient Buddhist site. It is one of numerous temple sites in northeastern Sri Lanka claimed by nationalist Buddhist monks, frequently with the support of government agencies and the security forces.

The Vavuniya magistrates court had earlier ruled that the rituals for the festival of Shivaratri, the principal festival day of the god Shiva, could go ahead at Veddukkunaari. However, on the evening of March 8, police arrived and assaulted worshippers, including an opposition member of parliament. Rights activists told Human Rights Watch the detainees said they were beaten in custody, for which the court requested a medical report, and their families denied access to them for the first three days. On March 19, the authorities’ allegations were dismissed at their third court appearance.

Hindu worshippers consider the Veddukkunaari site to be an ancient Hindu shrine. The Archaeology Department had claimed that the worshippers damaged antiquities, while the police contended that arrests were made because small ritual fires posed a hazard. Similar Hindu rituals have been conducted at Veddukkunaari for many years.

Buddhist monks, accompanied by soldiers, had gone to the site in February and said that a shivalingam, a typically stone cylindrical symbol worshiped by Hindus as a representation of Shiva, had recently been installed. Hindu symbols and idols there were damaged and destroyed in 2023, while the military and archaeological officials have been attempting to block Hindu worshipers from the site since at least 2018.

(Geneva) – The United Nations Human Rights Council should renew the mission of the UN special rapporteur on human rights in the Iran and the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission, 43 Iranian and International organizations including Human Rights Watch said today in a letter to member countries.

The letter was issued after the Fact-Finding Mission presented its first report to the rights council, concluding that the Government of Iran is responsible for serious human rights violations, including crimes against humanity.

“Victims and survivors in Iran rely on these critical international mechanisms amid the brutal ongoing crackdown,” said Nahid Naghshbandi, acting Iran researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The special rapporteur and Fact-Finding Mission play a vital role shining a spotlight on egregious abuses and amplifying the voices of survivors and victims for accountability and justice.”

The UN special rapporteur on Iran has played a crucial role since the position was established in 2011, monitoring and documenting abuses, engaging with Iranian authorities, including on individual cases, and supporting Iranian civil society.

The Fact-Finding Mission was established more recently – following the death in Iranian morality police custody of Jina Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman detained over her apparel – specifically to address the brutal state repression of nationwide protests in 2022, with a particular focus on the women and children. Its mandate focuses on advancing accountability for serious crimes, including through the collection and preservation of evidence and identification of suspected abusers.

In its report, presented to the UN Human Rights Council on March 8, 2024, it concluded that the Government of Iran committed serious human rights violations, including crimes against humanity, during the “Woman, Life, Freedom” protests. These violations disproportionately affected women, children, and minorities, intersecting with discrimination based on ethnicity and religion. As abuses relating to the protests continue to reverberate in Iran, with total impunity at national level, the Mission’s work remains critical.

The human rights situation in Iran has deteriorated significantly in recent years, with heightened repression – particularly against women – since protests in 2022. There has been a significant spike in the use of the death penalty in Iran over the past year, including against those involved in protests and against juvenile offenders, in clear breach of international law. Iranian law discriminates against Baha’is, arresting them on vague national security charges and denying their university registration. The government also targets Sunni Muslims and ethnic minority activists, arresting them on similar charges and restricting their cultural and political activities.",VERY HIGH,20240321T050000Z,"United Nations Human Rights Council, Iranian and International organizations including Human Rights Watch",Jina Mahsa Amini,Government of Iran,Iran,Renew the mission of the UN special rapporteur and the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission,"Serious human rights violations, including crimes against humanity",Iran,"Brutal state repression, discrimination based on ethnicity and religion"

On March 2, Andriy Sidak raced to his sister’s apartment building fearing the worst.

Earlier, a Russian drone had struck the building in the north part of Odesa. What he found was rubble and dust, the mangled remains of what had been a nine-story residential building. Witnesses say the drone hit the building at the sixth-floor level, causing concrete slabs of the upper floors of the building to collapse on the lower levels.

Sidak entered what remained of the apartment where his sister Anna Gaidarzhi lived with her husband Serhii and two children, a four-month-old son Tymofii and a three-year-old daughter Lizzi.

“The living room …, where they had a piano and a sofa, was gone. The huge concrete slab blocked the doorway to the bedroom where Anna and Tymofii slept,” said Sidak. “Their bodies were found last … in the basement. They died in their sleep, flattened by the rubble.”

Serhii and Lizzi survived.

In total, 12 people were killed in the attack, five of them children, the youngest of them Tymofii Gaidarzhi. The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine called it “the deadliest incident for children in more than nine months.”

Mykhailo Voitov, who lived on the seventh floor, was also killed in the collapse. His wife, Angelina, had fled to Germany in 2022 with their 11-year-old daughter because she was distressed about the war. The couple had been married for 33 years, and before the war started, had never been apart for more than one day.

“Our daughter was very frightened,” Angelina said after her husband’s funeral. “She has only just begun to settle down. I don’t know how her father’s death will impact her.”

Ukrainian authorities stated that the defense forces shot down seven drones launched by the Russian forces into Odesa that night. One drone hit a residential building. Human Rights Watch was unable to determine whether Ukrainian forces attempted to intercept the drone.

Russia’s full-scale invasion has killed and injured tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians. According to the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, most of the casualties have been from the use in populated areas of explosive weapons, such as missiles, drones, and artillery. Use of such weapons in populated areas should be avoided because of the heightened risk of indiscriminate and often devastating impact on civilians and infrastructure and, in the long run, post-conflict reconstruction.",VERY HIGH,20240321T204500Z,United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine,"Andriy Sidak, Serhii Gaidarzhi, Anna Gaidarzhi, Tymofii Gaidarzhi, Mykhailo Voitov, Angelina Voitov",Russian forces,"Residential building in Odesa, Ukraine",Avoid use of explosive weapons in populated areas; ensure protection of civilians in conflict zones.,Drone strike targeting residential area causing civilian casualties,Ukraine,Russia's full-scale invasion and use of explosive weapons in populated areas

Last week, in another blow to freedoms of association and expression in Uganda, a Ugandan court rejected a petition brought by Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG), a leading group advocating for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people, to compel the government to register the group's name. The petition was rejected on the grounds that the organization’s name is against “public interest.” Without registration, SMUG, which was shut down in August 2022 for failing to register with the NGO Bureau, cannot operate legally.

Today marks the first anniversary of the adoption of the Anti-Homosexuality Act (AHA), one of the harshest anti-LGBT laws in the world, signed by President Yoweri Museveni on March 21, 2023. The Supreme Court is currently examining petitions by human rights activists, journalists, academics, and religious leaders, who are challenging the repressive and controversial law. The attacks on LGBT rights have been part of a broader crackdown on civil society, including with respect to environmental rights activists.

SMUG, which has provided education on sexuality and advocated for health services since 2004, has been fighting to be legally recognized for more than a decade.

Their first attempt at registration was rejected by the Uganda Registration Services Bureau in 2012, also on the ground that their name was deemed to be against public policy. The Bureau also deemed them a criminal organization under section 145 of the Penal Code Act because “sexual minorities” are referenced in the group’s name and because they engaged with people whose sexual activities are criminalized. A lower court upheld this decision in June 2018, which SMUG appealed.

Last week’s ruling affirmed the previous judicial decisions. Although the court focused primarily on the naming issue, the judge noted that SMUG is associated with the promotion and protection of the rights of LGBT people, who, according to the AHA, are breaking the law.

Several human rights advocates have expressed their disappointment in the decision and view this ruling as a missed opportunity to protect the basic human rights of LGBT people, like freedoms of association and expression.

“This is invalidating all the advocacy work that has been done for years and gives the Anti-Homosexuality Act and all homophobes more power over people’s lives, bodies, and rights,” a Ugandan queer and feminist advocate told Human Rights Watch.

SMUG’s case is yet another reminder of the unjustified and arbitrary restrictions on human rights defenders in Uganda.

We, the undersigned Iranian and international human rights organizations, call on your country to support the renewal of the mandate of the United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran and the extension of the mandate of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Islamic Republic of Iran (FFMI) at the 55th session of the Human Rights Council. The continuation of these two distinct and complementary mandates is essential for the Council to fulfill its mandate of promotion and protection of human rights in Iran.

We also urge your government to use this opportunity to publicly voice alarm at grave and persistent violations of human rights committed in the country, some of which the FFMI held to “amount to crimes against humanity... committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against a civilian population, namely women, girls and others expressing support for human rights”[1], and to call for the end of these violations and for justice, truth and reparation.

***

The renewal of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur is essential, given the severity of the human rights crisis in Iran, characterized by ongoing crimes under international law and serious human rights violations affecting millions of people in Iran and the wide variety of rights curtailed. The monitoring, regular public reporting and capacity to engage with authorities and other stakeholders by the Special Rapporteur is a lifeline in this context.

At this session, the Council is again presented with a large body of evidence demonstrating the ongoing crisis of systemic impunity whereby crimes under international law and other human rights violations go unpunished in the country. This includes widespread violations of the right to life, not to be subjected to torture and other ill-treatment, to security and liberty of the person, to a fair trial, to an effective remedy, to freedom of religion or belief, of expression, of peaceful assembly and of association, and the rights to privacy, health, education, livelihood and work, as detailed below.

Women and girls continue to be treated as second-class citizens, amid an intensified crackdown for defying degrading and abusive compulsory veiling laws. Lesbian, Gay, Bi, Trans and Intersex people, as well as ethnic and religious minorities, are also subjected to systemic discrimination. Those targeted include Ahwazi Arabs, Azerbaijani Turks, Baluchis, Kurds and Turkmen; persons belonging to religious or belief minorities, including Baha’is, Christians, Gonabadi Dervishes, Jews, the Yarsan (Ahl-e Haq), Sunni Muslims and atheists.

In such a context, the renewal of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur is critical to monitor and document developments, and report to this Council on whether Iranian authorities are upholding their human rights obligations or failing to do so. The country rapporteur is essential to engage with Iranian authorities, and to make potentially life-saving urgent appeals and other communications, which include seeking to halt imminent executions and improve the circumstances of detained individuals and their access to urgent medical care. In a context marked by extremely repressive tactics to deny civic space, this mandate also draws attention to the voices of survivors, victims and their families, human rights defenders and others seeking truth and justice. Over the past decade, the Special Rapporteur’s expert findings and recommendations have proved critical to steer and inform the efforts of UN bodies and of member states to encourage Iran’s authorities to take measures to uphold their human rights obligations and hold them to account.

***

The mandate of the FFMI, established following the death in custody of Jina Mahsa Amini, to address violations committed in the context of the 2022 nationwide protests, with a particular focus on the women and children, also remains essential. Not only do violations related to the 2022 protests continue to reverberate in Iran, but the mandate has a crucial role in addressing the impunity fuelling those and other abuses.

As noted, the litany of crimes under international law related to the 2022 protests continue. Thousands of people, including children, have been subjected to abusive interrogations, arbitrary detention, unjust prosecution, and suspension or expulsion from education or employment for peacefully exercising their human rights. Intelligence and security bodies have continued to target family members of those unlawfully killed during the protests for seeking truth and justice for their loved ones’ killing. At least nine people have been arbitrarily executed in connection to protests following grossly unfair trials. In January 2024, UN experts strongly condemned the execution of Mohammad Ghobadlou, and noted that at least four individuals remain, reportedly, at imminent risk of execution in connection with the nationwide protests, while at least 15 others face the death penalty[2]. Meanwhile, impunity continues and there have been no impartial, independent, and effective domestic investigations into their use of unlawful and lethal force, torture and other ill-treatment, including rape and other forms of sexual violence, and other serious abuses.

The long-standing patterns of human rights violations detailed in the Annex are facilitated by what the FFMI described as a situation of “pervasive impunity”[3], where “authorities had failed to investigate allegations of human rights violations, or to prosecute or punish those responsible, and had deliberately and systematically obstructed any efforts by the victims and their families to obtain redress and establish the truth”[4].

As stressed by this Council in last year’s resolution, “sustained and systematic impunity for gross violations of human rights and an absence of accountability… create an enabling environment for perpetrators, violate victims’ right to an effective remedy and perpetuate cycles of violence”[5]. For past patterns of violations not to repeat in the future, this situation of pervasive impunity for human rights violations and international crimes must be addressed. Only an independent investigative body, with adequate resources, staffing and time, can properly address this fundamental challenge. The FFMI clearly has an important role to play in this regard.

In line with its mandate, the FFMI has put the situation of women and girls at the heart of its investigation. It concluded that the crime against humanity of gender-based persecution has been committed, and that “pervasive and deep-rooted structural and institutionalized discrimination against women and girls, permeating all areas of their public and private lives”[6] in Iran has been both “a trigger and an enabler” of the violations and crimes it has established. An extension of FFMI’s mandate would allow for further and deeper analysis of the gender dimension of human rights violations and crimes documented.

Despite delays in the operationalization process and budgetary challenges outside of its control, the FFMI has made significant progress investigating violations committed in the context of the protests. Gaps however remain, as noted above, and the FFMI needs more time and appropriate resources to process the important amount of evidentiary material gathered. More time will allow the FFMI to also address gaps left in its findings before submitting a final report, and to further promote pathways for justice, truth and reparation for gross violations of human rights and crimes under international law committed by Iranian officials. This will also ensure that the survivors, victims and their families who share their testimonies and participate in the establishment of truth and justice have their voices heard.

***

The two mandates are clearly distinct, and complementary. The FFMI fulfills temporarily a mission of investigation on a specific set of events marked by paroxysmic state violence that the Special Rapporteur mandate is not equipped to fulfill, and is specifically mandated to address impunity and the rights of women and children. The long-term mandate of the Special Rapporteur, meanwhile, is key to ensure that other violations not falling into the mandate of the FFMI are duly addressed and that Iranian authorities maintain some engagement with the Council on the wide array of human rights abuses they perpetuate on the population in Iran with impunity. The Special Rapporteur also plays a vital role working on individual cases, including in relation to the death penalty, the use of which sky-rocketed in 2023.

Victims and survivors of past and ongoing violations need these two mechanisms to be in place and operational. As do their families, human rights defenders, journalists and other media workers, dissidents and others who continue to face reprisals by the Iranian authorities solely for peacefully exercising their human rights.

For all these reasons, we urge your government to support extending at this session both the mandate of the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran and the mandate of the UN Fact-Finding Mission on Iran, and to press Iran to give these mechanisms unfettered access to the territory. We also call on your government to publicly voice its grave alarm at the human rights crisis in Iran, and to send a resounding message to the Iranian authorities that ongoing violations must stop, impunity for rights violations and international crimes must end and that Iranian officials will be held to account.

ANNEX

Violations documented in the past year include serious and widespread violations of the right to life, through what was described by the High Commissioner as a “sharp spike”[7] in executions reaching “frightening”[8] numbers, as over 800 persons were executed in 2023, the highest number since 2015, including seven in public. The Iranian authorities executed several individuals who were children at the time of the alleged offense, including one who was also a child at the time of execution, as well as six protesters arrested in relation to in the “Women, Life, Freedom” nationwide protests. Members of oppressed minorities, in particular Baluchis, were disproportionately impacted by the death penalty, as were Kurds. At least 22 women have been executed, the highest number since 2013.

Throughout the year, death sentences, corporal punishment, such as flogging and amputation, and prison terms were issued and/or carried out following grossly unfair trials within a judicial system that lacks independence and which, according to the Special Rapporteur “acts as a repressive organ instead of an independent body towards which individuals seek recourse”.[9] Those detained are routinely denied access to an independent lawyer and, as highlighted by a group of Special Procedures, lawyers “often work in peril within a legal profession that has been restricted by rules and regulations that contravene international standards relating to the free and independent exercise of the legal profession and the right to fair trial”.[10]

Additionally, in the last year, thousands of people, including children, have faced increased levels of judicial harassment and arbitrary detention for peacefully exercising their human rights. Those impacted include women and girls appearing in public without compulsory headscarves, actors and musicians, writers and academics, journalists, university students, Lesbian, Gay, Bi, Trans and other gender diverse and Intersex (LGBTI) individuals as well as human rights defenders, including labour rights activists, women’s rights activists, child rights defenders, lawyers and families seeking truth and justice for victims of unlawful killings.

As evidenced by the report of the Fact-Finding Mission, women and girls in Iran are subjected to “pervasive and deep-rooted structural and institutionalized discrimination against women and girls, permeating all areas of their public and private lives”[11]. A “Chastity and Hijab” bill, currently nearing adoption in Parliament, would codify and impose further draconian penalties severely violating the rights of woman and girls who are deemed not to abide by compulsory veiling laws, and criminalize non-state actors, including employers and shop-owners, who fail to enforce compulsory veiling. Iranian authorities have intensified their large-scale campaign to enforce compulsory veiling, including through surveillance of women and girls in public spaces, and mass police checks targeting women drivers. Since January 2023, tens of thousands of women have had their cars arbitrarily confiscated as punishment for defying Iran’s veiling laws. Others have been prosecuted and sentenced to flogging or prison terms or faced other penalties such as fines or being forced to attend “morality” classes. This all-out assault against women and girls claiming their human rights to freedom of expression, religion, belief and bodily autonomy is gravely concerning.",VERY HIGH,20240321T080000Z,Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran and other organizations,"Jina Mahsa Amini, Mohammad Ghobadlou, victims of protests, women and girls targeted for anti-veiling laws.",Iranian authorities,Islamic Republic of Iran,"Extension of the UN Special Rapporteur and Fact-Finding Mission mandates, international pressure on Iranian authorities to uphold human rights.","Grave and persistent violations of human rights, amounting to crimes against humanity, particularly against women, girls, and human rights defenders.",Iran,"Pervasive impunity within the Iranian judicial system, systemic discrimination, and repression of dissent."

Religious leaders in Iraq conduct thousands of marriages each year, including child marriages, that flout Iraqi laws and are not officially registered.

These marriages create a loophole around legal restrictions on child marriage and have disastrous effects on women and girls’ ability to get government services, register their children’s birth, and claim their rights.

Iraq should prosecute religious leaders who officiate at marriages in violation of Iraqi law, facilitate the legalization of unregistered marriages, and ensure that all Iraqis have the full range of their rights.

(Beirut) – Religious leaders in Iraq conduct thousands of marriages each year, including child marriages, that flout Iraqi laws and are not officially registered, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. These marriages violate women and girls’ rights and may leave them in precarious positions without social or financial support.

The 40-page report, “‘My Marriage was Mistake after Mistake’: The Impact of Unregistered Marriages on Women’s and Children’s Rights in Iraq,” documents the impacts of unregistered marriages on women and girls who enter them, and the downstream effects on their children. The unregistered marriages function as a loophole around legal restrictions on child marriage and have disastrous effects on women and girls’ ability to get government services and social services linked to their civil status, obtain birth certificates for their children, or claim their rights to dowry, spousal maintenance, and inheritance.

“Iraqi authorities need to recognize that unregistered marriages are opening the door to child marriage on a large scale,” said Sarah Sanbar, Iraq researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Iraqi authorities should take steps to halt the practice and not make women’s and children’s access to critical services like identity documents or health care dependent on their civil status.”

Human Rights Watch interviewed eight women and two men, all of whom married outside the courts, one child whose parents had married outside the courts, four local nongovernmental groups, and two international groups. Human Rights Watch also interviewed a judge at Al Bayaa court in Baghdad, and a judge at the Supreme Judicial Council.

Over the last 20 years, child marriage rates have steadily been increasing in Iraq. According to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 28 percent of girls in Iraq are married before age 18. According to the UN Assistance Mission in Iraq, 22 percent of unregistered marriages involved girls under age 14. Child marriage puts girls at increased risk of sexual and physical violence, adverse physical and mental health consequences, and being denied access to education and employment.

Although many communities in Iraq consider the religious marriages culturally legitimate, they are illegal under Iraq’s Personal Status Law and are not officially recognized until registered with the Personal Status Court, after which the couple is issued a civil marriage certificate.

Without a civil marriage certificate, women and girls are unable to give birth in government hospitals and are forced to opt for at-home births with limited access to emergency obstetric services. This increases the risk of medical complications that can threaten the life of both the mother and her baby, particularly when the mother herself is a child.

One woman interviewed, from southeast Baghdad, was married at 14 and was divorced by age 15. “My husband refused to ratify the marriage or divorce contract so legally [on my ID] I am still single,” she said. “I can’t claim the monthly [governmental financial support] of 105,000 IQD (about US$80) for divorced women since I have no proof of my marriage or divorce.”

Under Iraq’s Birth and Death Registration Law of 1971, parents can only obtain birth certificates for babies born in wedlock. A child without a birth certificate cannot secure any other identity document and is at risk of losing their legal identity or becoming stateless. If their status is left unresolved, these children may be barred from enrolling in schools, getting jobs, obtaining travel documents, owning property, or getting married.

“I was married when I was 14, and soon after I became pregnant, my husband abandoned our family and took my ID and our [religious] marriage contract with him,” one woman interviewed said. “I was so young, and I had to give birth in my mother’s house with a midwife because I couldn’t go to the hospital. I couldn’t get my daughter her documents, and now she is 16 and still has no documents.”

Her daughter said, “Not having documents really affects my mental health. I can’t go anywhere, and I never feel safe.”

When asked how her life would change if she were able to get her documents, she said, “It would allow me to go to school and experience a sense of citizenship within my nation. Compared to others, my aspirations might seem modest. I want to get an ID, go to school, earn a degree, and eventually get a job.”

The process to legalize an unregistered marriage is lengthy, complicated, and bureaucratic. The process becomes significantly more difficult in cases involving divorce or the death, disappearance, or denial of the marriage by one spouse. For many women, the social, financial, and emotional burdens associated with undergoing this process seem insurmountable, leading them to forego legalization, and thus, their rights.

When a couple in which one or both spouses are underage goes before the court to have their marriage legalized, the judge faces a fait accompli, Human Rights Watch said. If the judge refuses to legalize their marriage, it leaves the couple and their children in a precarious position. But when judges ratify religious marriage contracts involving children, it weakens the rule of law and facilitates the growing prevalence of child marriage in Iraq. Most judges opt to legalize child marriages.

In a case in which a Human Rights Watch researcher was in the courtroom, at Al Bayaa court in Baghdad in May 2023, a 17-year-old girl, visibly pregnant, entered with her father and her 20-year-old husband. They had married a year earlier and were seeking to legalize their marriage ahead of the birth of their child. Without deeper inquiry into the circumstances of the marriage and wishes of the underage bride, the judge asked her, her father, and her husband whether they consented to the marriage and then certified it.

There are no provisions in Iraqi law that explicitly punish religious leaders who officiate marriages that go unregistered, including in cases in which one spouse is a child. This enables religious leaders to sidestep Iraqi law with impunity, Human Rights Watch said.

A judge at the Supreme Judicial Council said that it may be possible to initiate prosecutions against religious leaders by using article 240 of the Iraqi penal code, which punishes any person “who contravenes an order issued by a public official or agent, municipal council or official or semiofficial body in accordance with their legal authority or who disobeys an order issued by those entities.” However, he said this provision has never been used.

“The impacts of not having a civil marriage contract can be devastating for women and girls, and their children,” Sanbar said. “Iraq should prosecute religious leaders who officiate marriages in violation of Iraqi law, facilitate the legalization of unregistered marriages, and ensure that all Iraqis are able to enjoy their full range of rights.”",VERY HIGH,20240303T054500Z,Human Rights Watch,Sarah Sanbar (Iraq researcher at Human Rights Watch),Religious leaders and Iraqi authorities,Iraq,"Prosecute religious leaders, facilitate legalization of unregistered marriages, uphold women's and children's rights.",Conducting unregistered marriages and facilitating child marriages against Iraqi law,Iraq,"Cultural legitimacy of religious marriages, lack of enforcement of laws against child marriage"

In the devastating conflict that’s been raging in Yemen for years, the warring parties sadly seem to agree on one thing: treating women as second-class citizens.

All authorities across Yemen’s fractured political landscape are increasingly restricting women’s freedoms. Primarily, they deny women’s freedom of movement, which undermines many other fundamental rights. Restrictions on movement harm women’s ability to access work, education, and health care.

It doesn’t matter which side of the conflict you look at; all sides are violating women’s rights. The Houthis, the Yemeni government, and the Southern Transitional Council, are all systematically violating women’s right to freedom of movement.

Authorities throughout the country are barring women from traveling between governorates without a male guardian’s permission or being accompanied by an immediate male relative. In some cases, women are also prevented from traveling abroad without a male guardian’s permission.

The proliferation of roadside checkpoints has allowed for these unjust restrictions to be enforced more frequently. Women interviewed for a new report said they had often been forced to turn around at checkpoints or stopped and harassed for hours when in a car without a male relative.

The very concept of a woman needing a “male guardian” to move from point A to point B is bad enough, but it gets worse. How “male guardian” is defined adds further humiliation on top of the discrimination. For example, a woman in her 50s was forced to get her son’s approval before she could travel. Her son was 14 years old.

What’s more, if a male guardian reports a woman to the police for traveling against his wishes, the Interior Ministry and security offices can arrest her.

The restrictions have made it more difficult for women to access higher education. In some cases, drivers have refused to take women to college campuses because they know the problems they will face at checkpoints.

Some checkpoint officials have specifically targeted women working with nongovernmental groups and humanitarian workers. The movement restrictions have in fact forced many Yemeni women to leave their jobs at aid organizations and UN agencies.

The result is doubly grim. The women lose much-needed income for their families, and a country full of people dependent on international assistance is deprived of these women’s knowledge and experience in the aid sector.

(Istanbul) – Social media companies should resist intensifying efforts by Turkish authorities to control their platforms through demands that they block content critical of the government ahead of important municipal elections on March 31, 2024, Human Rights Watch, ARTICLE 19, and 20 other human rights and journalists’ groups said in a statement released today.

Social media companies have restricted access to critical content in response to a January 2024 court order, demonstrating a greater willingness to bend to government pressure, rather than challenge censorship requests where they violate international human rights law. This approach undermines the platforms’ responsibility to respect human rights under the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which include resisting pressure to restrict freedom of expression.

Social media platforms should take a firm, united stance against formal and informal pressure targeting expression protected under international human rights law, and adopt heightened transparency in the face of increasing online censorship.

The following is the groups’ statement:

Ahead of Türkiye’s municipal elections on March 31, 2024, ARTICLE 19, Human Rights Watch, and 20 other rights groups and journalists’ organisations jointly call on social media platforms to uphold the free expression rights of their users and resist state censorship. They should also fully disclose all government requests to restrict accounts or content and be transparent about informal government pressure to restrict content on their platforms.

The rights groups and journalists’ organisations also call on the Turkish government to cease pressuring online platforms to block content.

As important country-wide local elections loom, the Turkish authorities are once again intensifying efforts to control social media platforms through use of the restrictive internet law, demanding the blocking of content critical of the government. Social media platforms should take a firm, united stance against formal and informal pressure targeting expression protected under international human rights law, and adopt heightened transparency in the face of increasing online censorship.

Escalating Pressure and Inadequate Platform Response

A recent striking instance of the Turkish authorities’ readiness to escalate censorship – along with an inadequate response from platforms – concerned a January decision of the Ankara 9th Criminal Peace Court.

On January 10, the X (formerly Twitter) Government Affairs account published a January 6 order from the Ankara court with a list of social media content to be blocked on several platforms. The court order targeted 210 items including profiles and content on X, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok that relate to Muhammet Yakut, a businessman from Türkiye accused of criminal activities, who has made allegations on social media of government corruption and organised criminal activity in Türkiye. While the court deemed the content a threat to “national security and protection of public order” under Article 8(a) of the Internet Law, the decision violated international freedom of expression standards and the platforms should not have blocked the content.

X also stated that the Turkish government had told the company that it was the only platform not fully complying with the court order. X had subsequently “taken action” on 12 accounts and 15 tweets among those identified in the court order. It did so despite acknowledging that the content should be protected under freedom of expression and that the company would challenge the order in court, indicating in its statement that these steps were necessary to prevent its entire platform from being blocked in Türkiye. While none of the accounts or tweets listed in the order is accessible from within Türkiye, many remain accessible from other countries.

A week after X’s announcement, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, published a case study andsubmitted a report to the Lumens database (a database run by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University) referring to the same court order in Meta’s Transparency Center. Noting that the restricted content did not violate its policies, Meta announced the blocking of 65 posts and 14 accounts for users in Türkiye based on the Turkish court order and indicated that its refusal to comply might have triggered sanctions including administrative fines, advertising bans for up to 6 months, and throttling of Meta’s entire services in Türkiye.

Although YouTube and TikTok have not commented publicly on the court order, research indicates that both platforms seem to have restricted access to the content specified in the court order. This includes several URLs on both the YouTube and TikTok platforms. On TikTok, the listed items are either completely inaccessible from multiple countries or only restricted in Türkiye. On YouTube, all listed URLs are inaccessible inside Türkiye and from multiple countries.

While some content restrictions were clearly labelled, in many instances platforms failed to indicate that the content was unavailable due to a court order. When attempting to access within Türkiye, the content was often labelled unavailable “because of a technical error” or showed messages of “video currently unavailable,” yet the same content remained accessible elsewhere. Similarly, entire accounts appeared as having posted “no content” when viewed from Türkiye, but displayed several posted videos when viewed from outside the country. This lack of transparency means that people navigating platforms from within Türkiye may never know that the content is purposefully restricted at the request of Turkish authorities and that the content may be accessible with the use of circumvention technologies.

In February 2024, ARTICLE 19 wrote to Google, YouTube’s parent company, and TikTok inquiring, among other topics, how they responded to the court order. TikTok shared their general commitment to human rights and their routine practice of handling government requests for content removal in Turkey, without addressing the specific questions raised about the January content removals. Google, on the other hand, did not respond.

Misguided Compliance Driven by Fear

It appears that the October 2022 legal amendments to Türkiye’s internet law have resulted in social media companies’ greater willingness to bend to government pressure, rather than use legal means to challenge censorship requests where they violate international human rights law. X and Meta’s admission that they have blocked content demonstrates this fear-driven response to the Turkish authorities’ escalating censorship demands. X cited explicit concerns about potential sanctions, such as service throttling. Meta made general reference to possible sanctions in their case study.

This approach undermines the platforms’ responsibility to respect human rights under the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), which include resisting pressure to restrict freedom of expression.

While the legislation allows for bandwidth throttling of up to 90 percent for noncompliance with even one takedown order, experience shows that, independent of the platforms’ actions and the provisions for throttling stipulated in the law, the Turkish authorities have on occasion precipitously blocked all access to certain platforms with little justification. An example of this came after the February 6, 2023, earthquakes, when the authorities resorted to a short period of throttling to block content.

However, evidence suggests extensive throttling over long periods before the elections is unlikely given the government and its supporters’ reliance on the platforms. The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) spent considerable amounts of money on political advertisements in the run-up to the May 2023 national elections, according to Meta’s Ad Library. In the same period, Meta also reported removing an extensive network of inauthentic accounts spreading commentary supportive of the AKP, including through manipulated content, which had about 1.3 million followers and spent close to $700,000 on advertisements to circulate its content.

Navigating Legal Pressures with Coordinated Response and Heightened Transparency

As four major platforms decided to appoint local representatives in compliance with the 2020 amendments, civil society organisations warned YouTube, Meta, X, and TikTok against complying with laws that violate human rights standards. While all four companies reaffirmed their commitment to freedom of expression, they provided very little explanation as to how they intended to navigate the new legal environment. At the time Meta stated that there was a potential to withdraw the local representative if faced with increasing political pressure.

While the government’s censorship has undoubtedly been increasing in recent years, and particularly intensified since the legal amendments to the country’s internet regulations in 2020 and 2022, the Turkish government has to date relied on a lack of transparency and coordination among platforms to isolate and pressure them individually into compliance. Shortly before Türkiye’s 2023 national elections, the Turkish authorities subjected platforms to threats of throttling for failure to comply with content removal demands. On two separate occasions, X has publicly indicated that Turkish authorities claimed it was the only platform failing to comply with a removal request and that this informed its decision to action the content.

This pressure is likely to continue as local elections draw closer. It is essential that platforms resist being subjected to individualized pressure by adopting a coordinated response and heightened transparency measures and challenging removal demands in court. Continued compliance with these orders may encourage the Turkish authorities to make further similarly arbitrary or excessive requests to remove content that falls within the boundaries of protected expression, ultimately implicating these companies in state censorship, said the rights group.

It is also crucial that platforms create contingency plans providing some means of access to their platforms in case shutdowns do occur at key moments during the upcoming elections, and to maintain access to content throughcircumvention technologies.

Recommendations for Social Media Platforms and the Turkish Government

As social media platforms operating in Türkiye are faced with increasing government pressure, ARTICLE 19, Human Rights Watch, and the 20 other rights groups and journalists’ organisations urge them to take the following steps, in consultation with civil society organisations and impacted communities:

Resist complying with blocking orders that restrict access to protected expression, including by challenging them in court and limiting the scope and duration of implementation. Assess blocking orders against international freedom of expression standards, considering in particular that political speech enjoys the highest level of protection.

Conduct additional human rights due diligence ahead of Türkiye’s March 2024 municipal elections to evaluate and mitigate the risk of becoming complicit in censorship and the freedom of expression implications of the potential sanctions by the government both on election day and the period leading up the election. This should include establishing a contingency plan to maintain platform access throughout the election period in the event of shutdowns or throttling.

Be transparent about government requests for censorship. This includes notifying users that content is not available at the URL where the content was hosted, the reason for its blocking (e.g., a government order) and publishing the order (including through the Lumens database) and case studies, when relevant. Publicising these actions expeditiously is key to holding governments accountable and mitigating isolated, informal pressure.

Engage with other companies to share information about formal and informal government pressure and commit to taking a united stance against particularly excessive censorship demands, particularly during election periods.

Engage with Turkish civil society for a better understanding of the implications of company policy and practices, the relevance of content or accounts that are subject to blocking orders, as well as the actual threat and implications of sanctions.



The Turkish government is the primary duty bearer to ensure the right to freedom of expression and free and fair elections. To comply with these obligations, it should:

Adhere to international freedom of expression and human rights standards and repeal provisions of Türkiye’s internet legislation that do not comply with international human rights law.

Refrain from using legal and extra-legal means to exert pressure on social media platforms to censor online content in violation of the human rights obligations, particularly content involving political discourse.

Increase transparency in dealings with social media platforms, including public disclosure of all content removal requests.

Ensure that any actions taken against online platforms strictly comply with the principles of legality, legitimacy, necessity, and proportionality.

Refrain from throttling or shutting down the platforms at any time, whether before, during or after the elections.

The Nepali government’s proposed bill on transitional justice contains important provisions, including for reparations, relating to the country’s civil war but still needs significant amendments.

It is widely recognized that a lack of accountability for conflict-era violations has led to a crisis of impunity in Nepal, with police and politicians rarely held accountable for rights violations and corruption.

This is a moment of opportunity, if the bill is properly amended, to deliver the truth, justice, and reparations long sought by victims and help protect the rights of all Nepalis in the future.

(Kathmandu) – The Nepali government’s proposed bill on transitional justice contains important provisions, including for reparations, relating to the country’s civil war but still needs significant amendments, Human Rights Watch and Advocacy Forum-Nepal said in a report published today. Public debate and human rights activism have helped improve the bill, but the current version risks shielding those responsible for some serious crimes, including war crimes and crimes against humanity, and denying some victims access to reparations.

The 50-page report, “Breaking Barriers to Justice: Nepal’s Long Struggle for Accountability, Truth and Reparations,” describes the decades-long struggle for justice by survivors and victims. Human Rights Watch and Advocacy Forum analyzed the proposed law and reviewed some emblematic cases that faced obstruction by the authorities. They also described obstacles to justice faced by survivors of sexual violence and relatives of victims who filed complaints in 62 cases of conflict-era extrajudicial killings with the assistance of Advocacy Forum. The bill requires amendments to meet victims’ needs as well as legal standards set by the Supreme Court and clearly established in international law.

“To deliver a durable and rights-respecting process without further delay, Nepal’s leaders should agree to amendments called for by victims and recommended by legal experts, then ask parliament to pass the bill into law,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “This is a moment of opportunity to deliver the truth, justice, and reparations long sought by victims and help protect the rights of all Nepalis in the future.”

It has been almost 18 years since the decade-long civil war in Nepal between Maoist insurgents and government forces ended with the 2006 Comprehensive Peace Agreement. Conducting a transitional justice process remains the major outstanding commitment of the peace agreement. The war killed up to 17,000 people and left up to 3,288 others “disappeared.”

On his visit to Nepal in October 2023, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres noted that Nepal is closer than ever before to beginning a meaningful transitional justice process. In November, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who was the leader of the Maoist insurgency, said: “The victims want the speedy advancement of this process. The government too shares the same aspiration.” However, there is a risk that the process will unravel again if the proposals to amend the transitional justice law currently before parliament fall short or if momentum is lost, the groups said.

Accountability for serious crimes under international law is essential to uphold victims’ rights and ensure sustainable peace. The UN special rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence has identified five pillars of transitional justice: truth, justice, reparations, memorialization, and guarantees of non-recurrence. The current bill provides for reparations and interim relief for some victims, including victims of torture and rape, who were left out of earlier relief packages. It guarantees the right of the families of victims of enforced disappearance to their relatives’ property. It also mandates the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) to study the root causes and impact of the conflict and recommends institutional reforms.

Under the proposal, the TRC and Commission for Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons (CIEDP) would be the sole bodies investigating alleged crimes committed during the conflict. Cases classified as “serious violations of human rights” could be referred to and prosecuted in a special court. The bill’s definition of “serious violations” includes rape, enforced disappearance, “cruel or inhuman torture,” and a definition of unlawful killing that remains to be finalized. However, the bill excludes numerous serious crimes under international law, including some acts of torture and other unlawful killings, creating a significant accountability gap, the groups said.

In a separate category, the bill defines “violations of human rights” other than those considered “serious” as “any acts against the domestic law, international human rights law or humanitarian law,” which cannot be referred to the special court. Because this category of crimes is excluded from prosecution, this language risks providing de facto amnesty to those responsible for some serious human rights violations and grave crimes under international law. Amnesty for serious crimes is contrary to Nepali and international law and standards and violates victims’ rights.

Importantly, the bill requires that both categories of violations (serious and not) are committed “in a targeted or planned manner against an unarmed individual or community.” This means that alleged perpetrators of crimes committed against combatants, or in a non-targeted or unplanned manner, are excluded from any possibility of criminal accountability. It also implies that the victims of these crimes are not eligible for consideration for other measures outlined in the bill, such as reparations.

The bill does not ensure the independent appointment of judges to the special court, nor does it provide for the financial independence of the transitional justice bodies.

Many survivors of sexual violence, who have faced trauma and severe social stigma, were unable to register their cases when conflict-era human rights violations were being recorded by the government between 2016 and 2018. The currently proposed window of three months to register sexual violence cases is inadequate, the groups said.

Nepal previously adopted a transitional justice law in 2014, but it was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2015 because it provided amnesty for perpetrators of serious crimes. The TRC and CIEPD were established by the 2014 law and have registered over 60,000 cases, but have failed to resolve a single one. There has been little or no progress in the 62 complaints of conflict-era extrajudicial killings that have been registered with the police with the support of Advocacy Forum, which are tracked in this report and a series of five previous reports since 2008. Victims of rights violations committed during the conflict have gone to the transitional justice commissions, to Nepali courts, to the United Nations, and to foreign jurisdictions seeking justice to no avail.

In numerous statements made during and after Secretary-General Guterres’s recent visit to Nepal, victims’ groups called for a process that includes all the different elements of transitional justice, including criminal accountability and reparations.

It is widely recognized that a lack of accountability for conflict-era violations has led to a crisis of impunity in Nepal, the groups said. The police and security forces are rarely, if ever, investigated for deaths in custody allegedly resulting from torture or for killing protesters by using excessive force. Nor are politicians and officials held accountable for widespread corruption that undermines public services and violates economic and social rights.

Nepal’s international partners should follow the UN’s lead by only offering support for a process that meets Nepali and international legal standards, Human Rights Watch and Advocacy Forum said. They should also ensure that any donor support is delivered in a way that ensures best practices, including transparency and independence from the government, such as a funding structure under UN auspices.

“If the transitional justice bill is passed without appropriate amendments, it risks hindering the search for justice,” said Bikash Basnet, director of Advocacy Forum. “If it is appropriately amended, it can be the basis for a meaningful, nationally-owned process that upholds the rights of victims and benefits all Nepalis by strengthening institutions and the rule of law.”",HIGH,20240306T050000Z,Human Rights Watch and Advocacy Forum-Nepal,"Meenakshi Ganguly, António Guterres, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Bikash Basnet",Nepali government and transitional justice bodies,Nepal,Amend the transitional justice bill to align with international standards and ensure victims' rights.,"Failure to provide adequate transitional justice, accountability and reparations for victims of the civil war",Nepal,"Lack of accountability, impunity for police and politicians, inadequacy of previous laws"

(Beirut) – In early February 2024, the Egyptian authorities issued new legislation that will entrench and widen the already broad powers of the military over civilian life in a manner that undermines rights, Human Rights Watch said today. The new laws grant sweeping new authority for the military to fully or partially replace certain functions of the police, civilian judiciary, and other civilian authorities and further expand the jurisdiction of military courts to prosecute civilians.

On January 22, a new law and amendments to an existing law were presented by the government to the parliament, which swiftly approved them with little to no discussion or edits in one plenary session on January 28. The legislation includes Law No. 3 of 2024 on Guarding and Protecting the State’s Public and Vital Facilities and Buildings, which was published in the Official Gazette on February 4. Parliament also approved numerous amendments to Law No. 25 of 1966 on the Military Code of Justice that are expected to be published in the Official Gazette soon.

“Entrenching the military’s domination over civilian life is a strategy to contain increasing discontent over the Egyptian government’s dismal failures to uphold and ensure basic economic and political rights,” said Amr Magdi, senior Egypt researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Egypt’s financial crisis will not be solved by railroading increasing numbers of Egyptians through patently unfair military trials and locking them away.”

Law No. 3 tasks the armed forces with “assisting, and fully coordinating with the police, in guarding and protecting public and vital facilities and buildings including power stations, electricity lines and towers, oil fields, railway tracks, roads, bridges,” and “other comparable facilities.” The law provides military personnel involved in such operations with the same judicial powers of arrest and seizure as the police. It also stipulates that all offenses against or in relation to broadly worded “vital” public facilities and buildings are to be prosecuted in military courts.

This law contains broader, more abusive provisions than its predecessor, Law No. 136 of 2014, which President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi issued by decree in October 2014. His government used the 2014 law to prosecute thousands of civilians, including dozens of children, in military courts, often in mass trials ending in harsh prison or death sentences. Reflecting the chaotic, abusive nature of mass trials in which basic documents are not checked and individual criminal responsibility is frequently not established, a notable case in 2016 resulted in a life sentence against a 3-year-old defendant that, following an outcry, a military spokesperson later said was issued by mistake.

The 2014 law said that it would apply for only two years. The government justified it saying the military trials were necessary to address waves of violent attacks on government facilities during that period. However, in 2016, the law was extended for five additional years, and then in October 2021 the law’s provisions were made permanent.

A significant new element in the new law grants military personnel the authority to inspect and search places, arrest people, or confiscate materials for the purpose of confronting “offenses that harm the basic needs of the society including food commodities and essential products.”

The new authority is to “preserve the fundamental pillars of the state, the people’s gains and rights, or national security as determined according to decrees by the president or his delegated deputy after consulting the National Defense Council.” This unprecedented broad language invites further military intervention into civilian governance and everyday life, giving the president and his generals a free hand to define threats to national security, Human Rights Watch said.

The new law also grants the defense minister the power to determine numbers, locations, tasks, and distribution of military personnel “as required by the nature of their work inside those vital and public facilities and buildings.” This provision could be utilized to permanently deploy military personnel at civilian government facilities, which can undermine their independence, or lead to abusive crackdowns by military forces on peaceful assemblies near such facilities.

The “food commodities and essential products” mentioned in the law to be protected by the military include food, non-alimentary, and fuel products that are government subsidized for low-income citizens. They usually include food such as bread, rice, lentils, sugar, flour, beans, and cooking oil; home essentials such as soaps and laundry detergents; and fuel such as home-used butane gas cylinders. The Ministry of Supply and Internal (Domestic) Trade oversees the supply and purchase of these products and their subsidized prices, while investigating and detaining those responsible for market violations normally lies within the Supply and Trade Administration, part of the Interior Ministry’s police.

Parliament members , government officials, and pro-government media reports have all said that the law’s new language around food and commodities aims to give the military the power to intervene to control markets against “manipulation,” indicating that the law could be used to target people involved in what the authorities perceive as economic-related offenses, such as monopolies, or trading hard currency on the black market.

Egypt is facing a soaring fiscal crisis and skyrocketing food prices on top of multi-year economic downturn. President al-Sisi’s government has consistently responded to dissent and criticism by harassing and jailing critics of its political and economic choices that have led to rising poverty and unprecedented foreign debt as well as those who have criticized the rapid expansion of opaque, giant military-owned businesses. In recent weeks, numerous videos emerged on social media showing citizens complaining about their inability to meet their basic needs for food and commodities as prices increased almost daily as well as the foreign currency crisis that has dramatically devalued the Egyptian pound.

Amendments to the Military Code of Justice include adding to the military courts’ jurisdiction crimes committed against “public and vital facilities and public properties, and other comparable things, that are protected by the armed forces.” Other amendments introduced new military appeals courts for major offenses, following the template of a similar change in January made to the civilian court structure. Previously, appeals in cases of major offenses in military courts went directly to the Military Cassation Court, the military counterpart of the Cassation Court in the civilian justice system.

While increasing opportunities for legal appeals could be a positive change, it does not alter the well documented abusive record of military courts, their lack of independence, and their inability to uphold the right to a fair trial. The motivation appears to be increasing the military judiciary’s capacity to replace the function of the civilian court system rather than limiting its mandate to military staff, Human Rights Watch said. The amendments introduced a new entity within the Defense Ministry to oversee military courts, but they did not change the nature of military judges as serving military officers who are subject to the Defense Ministry’s laws regulating issues related to hierarchy, promotion, discipline, and general work.

The Parliament speaker, Hanafy El Gebaly, and other officials have said that the Defense Ministry introduced the amendments to meet its “constitutional duties,” highlighting the fact that various constitutional amendments and laws in recent years have expanded the military’s ability to intervene in political life. These include, for example, an amendment to constitutional article 200, in 2019, that gave the military the duty to “protect the constitution and democracy, and safeguard the basic components of the State and its civilian nature, and the people’s gains, and individual rights and freedoms.” In analyzing those amendments, Human Rights Watch said then that they would significantly expand the military’s authority.

Since President al-Sisi, as then-defense minister, led the July 2013 military coup against late President Mohamed Morsy, exploiting public dissatisfaction with Morsy’s administration to justify his forcible removal, the military has increasingly emerged as the dominant state institution. It has also dramatically expanded its economic role, operating mega projects across vast commercial sectors.

Human Rights Watch strongly opposes trials of civilians before military courts in all circumstances, as their proceedings frequently severely undermine due process rights and because of how authoritarian governments have used them to punish peaceful dissent. The United Nations Human Rights Committee has expressed concerns about military trials of civilians in Egypt as early as in 2002, even though back then they were a much smaller scale.

The African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, in interpreting the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, has said that military courts “should not, in any circumstances whatsoever, have jurisdiction over civilians.” It said that even when military courts follow guidelines for fair trial guarantees – as they always should – their “only purpose” should be in “offenses of a purely military nature committed by military personnel.”

“Instead of revisiting political and economic policies that have undermined the political and economic human rights of millions of Egyptians, President al-Sisi’s government has enhanced the military’s political and economic power,” Magdi said. “The armed forces should not be pitted against their own peoples’ hopes for dignity, bread, and freedom.”",HIGH,20240305T070000Z,Human Rights Watch,"President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Amr Magdi",Egyptian authorities,Egypt,"Opposition to military trials of civilians, revisiting political and economic policies to uphold rights","Issuing legislation expanding military powers over civilian life, undermining rights",Egypt,"Increasing discontent over government economic and political failures, financial crisis in Egypt"

Yesterday at a special congress in Versailles, France’s parliament voted by an overwhelming majority to add the freedom to have an abortion to the country’s constitution. Though abortion has been legal in France since 1975, the historic move aims to establish a safeguard in the face of global attacks on abortion access and sexual and reproductive health rights: President Emmanuel Macron initiated it after the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which had constitutionalized the freedom to have an abortion as part of the right to privacy.

The vote, a global first in introducing explicit abortion protections in a national constitution, is a win for civil society organizations that have pushed for reproductive justice. This is an important move to uphold the right to autonomy, ensuring people can make informed decisions about their own lives, bodies, health, and wellbeing. That includes choices about sexual and reproductive health care, including abortion.

Now Macron’s government should ensure the constitutional amendment is more than a political statement. Despite positive steps in recent years, people in France face ongoing barriers to abortion care and widely varying access.

And while the newfound protection of abortion is a victory, it should not eclipse other areas of women’s rights in which France’s government does not set a shining example. Persistent violence against women – including 31 reported femicides in 2024 so far – has spurred criticism of insufficient measures to prevent violence, protect victims, and hold perpetrators accountable. France played a key role in blocking inclusion of rape as a crime based on lack of consent in the first-ever European Union directive on violence against women, agreed upon in February.

France has also actively restricted women’s and girls’ dress, banning full face veils in public places, head scarves (hijab) and long robes (abayas) in schools, and head coverings for athletes, including in national and international competition. All disproportionately impact Muslim women and girls.

Moreover, the European Court of Human Rights has agreed to hear a case brought by sex workers related to France’s 2016 law criminalizing the purchase of sex, after which there was a spike in murders of sex workers as well as other dangers.

To realize the constitutional amendment’s promise, and to be a true beacon on women’s rights, the French government should address obstacles to abortion care and take concrete steps to uphold women’s and girls’ rights across the board. Other governments should do the same.",HIGH,20240305T124500Z,civil society organizations,President Emmanuel Macron,French government,"Versailles, France",French government to address barriers to healthcare and deliver on women's rights comprehensively.,Insufficient measures to prevent violence against women and barriers to abortion care,France,"Ongoing societal and institutional barriers, historical context of women's rights in France"

(Beirut) – Bulgarian authorities should immediately suspend any plans to deport a Saudi human rights activist to Saudi Arabia, Human Rights Watch said today. He would be at serious risk of arbitrary detention, torture, and an unfair trial if he is sent back there.

Abdulrahman al-Khalidi has been a human rights activist for more than a decade, advocating for the rights of prisoners in Saudi Arabia and countering the government’s digital propaganda, including their online troll armies. Al-Khalidi initially fled Saudi Arabia in 2013, fearing for his safety due to his activism. In October 2021, he crossed by foot into Bulgaria to claim asylum after living in exile for nearly a decade. On February 7, 2024, the Bulgarian National Security Agency issued al-Khalidi a deportation order, placing him at imminent risk of deportation.

“Abdulrahman al-Khalidi has spent more than a decade defending human rights at great personal risk, but he now faces a serious threat of detention and torture if Bulgarian authorities deport him to Saudi Arabia,” said Joey Shea, Saudi Arabia researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Despite the massive whitewashing efforts by Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto Saudi ruler, Saudi Arabia’s human rights record remains abysmal, and al-Khalidi is in grave danger of arbitrary detention and torture if forcibly returned.”

From 2011 to 2013, al-Khalidi was living in Saudi Arabia and advocating for the rights of prisoners in the country as part of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Assocation, also known as “HASM.” He participated in multiple demonstrations in support of Saudi detainees in Riyadh. In March 2013, al-Khalidi fled Saudi Arabia out of concern for his safety, first to Egypt, then Qatar, and finally Turkey.

In exile, he continued his activism and worked as an opposition journalist for seven years, writing articles critical of the Saudi government. He was also active in an online Saudi movement established by the late journalist Jamal Khashoggi called the Bees Army , which sought to counter pro-Saudi government propaganda campaigns and online troll armies.

In the aftermath of Khashoggi’s murder in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, al-Khalidi feared for his safety and did not renew his identity documents, which may have required him to appear in the same consulate where Khashoggi was murdered. On October 23, 2021, he fled yet again and crossed into Bulgaria to claim asylum, where he now faces imminent deportation.

Given the rampant torture and due process violations in Saudi Arabia’s criminal justice system, Bulgaria would violate the principle of nonrefoulement by deporting a highly visible critic of the Saudi government at risk of being persecuted for his political opinions or being tortured.

Social media posts reviewed by Human Rights Watch show that al-Khalidi has been subject to a torrent of abuse from Saudi government-linked influencers. One such post called al-Khalidi a “traitor” and accused him of “treachery” as well as conspiring to “seek to destroy the homeland and sell it to the enemies.” Another threatened that “the coming months will be catastrophic.”

Human Rights Watch has repeatedly criticized rampant abuses in Saudi Arabia’s criminal justice system, including long periods of detention without charge or trial, denial of legal assistance, and the courts’ reliance on torture-tainted confessions as the sole basis of conviction. These violations of defendants’ rights are so fundamental and systemic that it is hard to reconcile Saudi Arabia’s criminal justice system with a system based on the basic principles of the rule of law and international human rights standards. Saudi Arabia applies its uncodified interpretation of Islamic law as its national law. In the absence of a written penal code or narrowly worded regulations, judges and prosecutors can convict people on a wide range of offenses under broad charges such as “breaking allegiance with the ruler” or “trying to distort the reputation of the kingdom.”

Deporting al-Khalidi may violate Bulgaria’s international obligations, including article 3 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which states that “no State Party shall expel, return (“refouler”) or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture,” and article 33 of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, which prohibits the “return of a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers or territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.” Bulgaria is a signatory to both conventions.

The authorities across Yemen are increasingly restricting women’s freedom of movement.

The restrictions have harmed women’s ability to access work, education, and health care, and are a form of discrimination.

All governing authorities should immediately end policies that restrict women’s movement and ensure that checkpoint officers are trained to protect all Yemeni residents’ fundamental rights.

(Beirut) – Parties to the conflict in Yemen, including the Houthis, the Yemeni government, and the Southern Transitional Council (STC), are systematically violating women’s right to freedom of movement, Human Rights Watch said today.

The authorities are barring women from traveling between governorates, and in some cases from travel abroad, without a male guardian’s permission or being accompanied by an immediate male relative. Houthi authorities have drastically expanded restrictions against women’s movement in their territories since taking control of Sanaa, the capital, and much of northern Yemen in the last nine years. Yemeni government forces and STC have restricted women’s movement in the south.

“Instead of focusing their efforts on ensuring that people in Yemen have access to clean water and adequate food and aid, warring parties are spending their energy raising barriers to women’s freedom of movement,” said Niku Jafarnia, Yemen and Bahrain Researcher at Human Rights Watch. “These restrictions have a terrible impact on women’s lives and impedes their ability to get health care, education, and work, and even to visit their families.”

Human Rights Watch spoke with 21 women, mostly activists or women working with nongovernmental organizations, between August and November 2023 about the movement restrictions that they faced, and the impact this has had on their lives; as well as two men who work as private drivers transporting people between governorates. The women are from governorates around Yemen, including Aden, Taizz, Hudaydah and Sanaa. In addition, Human Rights Watch reviewed Yemeni laws and regulations, as well as recent Houthi guidances to car companies and travel agencies that restrict women’s movement.

Based on Human Rights Watch research, movement restrictions have affected women across all sectors of Yemeni society. Several people interviewed also said that some checkpoint officials specifically targeted women working with nongovernmental organizations and humanitarian workers. The UN Panel of Experts on Yemen in its 2023 report said it has received reports of women being prevented from traveling in Houthi-controlled areas.

Human Rights Watch specifically researched movement restrictions in areas under Houthi, Yemeni government, and STC control, as they control the majority of territory in Yemen. However, several people interviewed said that groups that control other areas, including al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and Islah, have also restricted women’s movement.

While Yemen’s law does not require women to travel with an immediate male family member, Human Rights Watch has previously reported that some of Yemen’s laws and practice restricted women’s movement long before the outbreak of the current conflict in 2014. Yemen’s 1992 Personal Status Law says that women can lose their right to spousal maintenance if they leave the marital home without their husband’s consent or for a “legitimate reason.”

In practice, if a male guardian reports a woman to the police for traveling against their wishes, the Interior Ministry and security offices can arrest her at checkpoints. Furthermore, while Yemen’s 1990 Passports Law gives all Yemenis over age 16 the right to obtain an ordinary passport, in practice, the authorities require a woman to have both the permission and presence of their male guardian to obtain or renew their personal identity cards or passports.

An activist living in Aden, said that “even though what [women] had before the war wasn’t great,” since the conflict began in 2014, “the women’s movement has regressed more.”

In the north, Houthi authorities increasingly began requiring women to travel with a male relative or to provide evidence of their male guardians’ written approval after taking control of Sanaa, a policy that had not existed before the war. In 2019, local media reported that the Houthi authorities had issued directives to local bus transportation companies requiring women be escorted by a male relative when traveling between cities in Yemen.

In December 2022, UN human rights experts reported that the Houthis’ Land Transport Regulatory Authority had issued a verbal directive in August 2022 requiring women who travelled anywhere within Houthi-controlled areas or outside the country to be accompanied by a male relative.

Two women said they had decided to leave Sanaa, Houthi-controlled territory, and move to Aden, in STC-controlled territory, in 2023 because of the increasing restrictions on women and nongovernmental organizations that the Houthis have imposed over the last few years. “I personally can’t rent a car because I have no husband, brother, or father,” one woman said.

A political activist living in Taizz described the challenges her sister, who lives in Sanaa, faces when traveling. “[She’s] a woman in her 50s and was forced to get her approval from her son – who was 14 years old – to travel. What a shame! That means that the Houthi[s] don’t recognize women as full citizens.”

In the south, while there has been no reported official guidance from the Yemeni government or the STC that similarly requires a woman to travel with a male relative, all but one of the 21 women interviewed said that they have been forced to turn around or been stopped at checkpoints, sometimes for many hours, when trying to move from one governorate to another without a male relative.

Many also reported being harassed and humiliated at checkpoints. The activist from Aden said she had been stopped for hours at an internationally recognized, government-controlled checkpoint entering Marib. She said that after five hours someone she had called to help her came to the checkpoint with a military ID and told the checkpoint officer that he was her relative and would guarantee her stay. The checkpoint officer’s response was, she said, “But she’s working with NGOs and women who work with NGOs are [a derogatory expletive].”

The UN has reported that these movement restrictions have forced many Yemeni women to leave their jobs at local and international nongovernmental organizations and UN agencies, because they do not have a relative who can accompany them on their crucial work travel, losing much-needed income for their families, and cutting off Yemeni women and girls from receiving humanitarian aid.

The restrictions have also impacted women’s ability to access higher education. In some cases, drivers have refused to take women to campus because they know what they will face at checkpoints, including in the south. “I dreamed of studying for a master’s degree in political science,” said a woman in Taizz. ”But this simple dream seems to be impossible now because of the mahram [male relative] requirement.”

“Psychologically we’ve been broken down,” a women’s rights activist told Human Rights Watch. “To speak about women’s empowerment feels ridiculous when we can’t even move around.”

The Yemeni government, the STC, and the Houthi’ movement restrictions violate Yemen’s obligations under the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the Arab Charter on Human Rights, and contradict Yemen’s constitution which also guarantees these rights.

Human Rights Watch wrote to the Human Rights Ministries of the Houthis, the Southern Transitional Council, and the Yemeni government on January 8, 2024. The STC replied on January 17, denying that checkpoints under their authority have stopped women if they were traveling without a male relative. Human Rights Watch evidence directly contradicts this. The Houthis and the Yemeni government did not respond.

“The impacts that these movement restrictions have on women’s lives are disastrous not only for women, but for all of Yemeni society,” Jafarnia said. “All governing authorities should immediately cease any policies in place that restrict women’s movement and ensure that checkpoint officers are trained to protect all Yemeni residents’ fundamental rights.”

Houthi Violations of Women’s Freedom of Movement

Since the Houthis took over the capital, Sanaa, in 2014, the group increasingly began imposing restrictions on women throughout its territories, which now includes most of northwest Yemen where the majority of the population lives. Mwatana for Human Rights, a Yemeni civil society organization, has documented how the Houthis have introduced requirements that women travel with an immediate male relative or with their male guardian’s permission, imposed dress codes, required gender segregation in some public spaces, and impeded access to women’s contraceptives. The Houthis have also imprisoned women based on charges relating to “indecency,” including the Yemeni model and actress Intisar al-Hammadi, who remains unlawfully detained.

Mwatana has said that before 2021 the Houthis’ imposed restrictions on women’s movement at random and mainly through harassment at checkpoints but that after 2021 checkpoints around Sanaa began to consistently block women traveling without a male relative.

The UN reported that in July 2022, the Houthi Land Transport Regulatory Authority (LRTA) directed travel and car rental offices to require women to obtain written consent by a male guardian, attested by the neighborhood leader, to travel or rent a car. In August 2022, according to the UN, the LRTA issued orders to transportation offices and car rental companies, instructing them to prohibit women from traveling without the accompaniment of a male relative.

In February 2023, the Houthi authorities responded to the UN, stating there was no new directive from the Land Transport Regulatory Authority, and that “all the rules in force today have existed for many years” and otherwise claiming that “the requirement of a male reltive is not a discriminatory measure.” However, Human Rights Watch has reviewed permission forms from local transportation companies that reflect these Houthi directives.

In practice, the authorities will allow women to travel without a male relative only if they have the prior written approval of a male guardian, and began actively overseeing the implementation of this order within their territories. A doctor from Aden who works in Sanaa told Human Rights Watch that for women to get permission to travel alone without a male relative, “the relative needs to go to the transportation offices or car rental companies, prove that they are the women’s guardian, state that they don’t mind [their female relative] traveling alone. Then, the transportation office or rental companies should communicate with Houthi authorities to get their approval and have the women’s name sent to their checkpoints, so that they can travel without being stopped or harassed.”

Since the new directives, many Yemeni women have faced significant problems traveling in and out of Sanaa. Two women interviewed said that in the last year, they made the difficult decision to leave their homes in Sanaa and move to Aden, in large part because of the difficulties of getting in and out of Sanaa, which they regularly needed to do for work and to visit their families in other areas of the country.

“[The restrictions] forced me to rent a house in Aden,” said one woman. She said that despite having lived in Sanaa since 2007, and feeling more at home there than in Aden, she had returned to Aden in December 2022 because of the difficulty of traveling in and out of Sanaa as a single woman.

Many women do not have a father, husband, or brother, who can serve as their guardian to provide permission or accompany them when they need to travel. One woman said that in November 2022, authorities at the Yasleh checkpoint at the entrance of Sanaa stopped the bus she had taken from Sanaa to Aden because she was traveling without a male relative. She said the officer at the checkpoint reprimanded the driver, stating that it was forbidden to transport a woman without a male relative. Though the driver told the officer that the woman’s father was unwell, the officer stated that regardless of the father’s health or other circumstances, the father, as the woman’s male guardian, was required to obtain permission from Houthi authorities for the women to travel alone.

“I cried and told them that my mother had a stroke, and that I will travel to Aden even if I have to walk all the way,” she said. She said that after three hours and a fine to the bus driver, the male travelers on the bus were able to pressure the guards to let the bus through.

Even for women who do have a male relative, the restrictions impose an undue burden to their movement, and are a form of discrimination.

A woman from Sanaa working at a nongovernmental organization in Aden said that in July 2023 she was stuck in Sanaa for two days when trying to return home to Aden with her mother and sister after visiting family in Sanaa. The officer at the Yesleh checkpoint in Sanaa stopped them, stating that her brother or father would need to get approval from the Interior Ministry for the women to travel without a male relative. “My brother is good, he lets me go,” she said. “But what if there is a girl with a different family or a different environment? She can’t go anywhere.”

Another woman said that: “Women traveling alone can face real dangers. They might be stopped, interrogated, insulted, and humiliated by the Houthi forces. Even if they have the travel consent signed by their families and male relative, they will still face challenges at checkpoints.”

The UN also reported that since December 2020, Houthi authorities have increasingly enforced a requirement that aid agencies, including local and international nongovernmental organizations and UN agencies, must include a male relative’s name when submitting travel requests for any female Yemeni staff traveling for work. According to the UN, Many female staff do not have such a male relative, which led many to leave their jobs, losing much-needed income for their families.

In addition, as part of the Houthi Land Transport Regulatory Authority’s August 2022 guidance, they issued restrictions in areas they control requiring that women no longer be permitted to travel outside the country without a male relative.

In December 2022, several United Nations human rights experts sent a letter to the Houthis detailing the group’s “systematic violations of women’s and girls’ rights,” including their rights to freedom of movement, freedom of expression, health, and work, as well as widespread discrimination.

Government and STC Violations Against Women’s Freedom of Movement

Women traveling in areas of the country controlled by the Yemeni government and Southern Transitional Council (STC) have also reported being blocked from traveling at various checkpoints, despite no official guidance restricting women from traveling without a male relative from either group.

Several women said that they had been stopped many times at various Yemeni government and STC checkpoints, particularly at the entrances of governorates, including al-Hangar checkpoint in Taizz, al-Rebat and al-Hadid checkpoints in Aden, and Nihm checkpoint in Marib.

They said that these restrictions had not existed prior to the conflict and have grown more common in the last few years. Several women said that a social media campaign in 2022 by a fake account under name of “Sumaia al-Khoulani” against Yemeni women working in nongovernmental organizations, and subsequent religious discourse, had led to increased discrimination against and restrictions on women. “In Taizz, they spoke about this [social media campaign] at Friday prayers,” one woman said. “These hate speeches pushed some of the parties to the conflict to create all of these restrictions to ’protect’ women.”

An activist living in Aden, describing the government’s and religious leaders’ increasing repression of women across southern Yemen, said, “There’s no electricity, there’s no water, but what do they do? They focus on women.”

Interviewees said they believed that checkpoint officers specifically target women who appear to be working for nongovernmental organizations, and as a broader practice often treat women – and men – worse if they believe they are from Houthi-controlled areas.

Al-Rebat checkpoint, controlled by the STC, is at the border between Aden and Lahj governorates. Several women reported being harassed, humiliated, and in some cases blocked from traveling by officers at the checkpoint when trying to pass through it without a male relative.

One woman said that when she traveled to Aden with a female colleague in February 2023, they were stopped by the STC officers at the al-Rebat checkpoint and were told to get out of the car. “They asked where we were going and why we were traveling without a mahram,” she said. “I told them we are the relatives for each other, and we are traveling for work, but he refused to allow us in.”

A private driver who frequently makes the journey between Taizz and Aden said that al-Rebat checkpoint “doesn’t respect women.” He said that checkpoint officers at al-Rebat allow women traveling with their families to easily pass through, but that women traveling alone, “especially women working with nongovernmental organizations and civil society organizations” are stopped and interrogated.

Several women also reported problems crossing through al-Hangar checkpoint in Taizz. “Once, I left Aden a bit late, so I arrived in Taizz in the evening, around 7 p.m.,” one woman said about a february 2023 incident “They stopped me at al-Hangar checkpoint, and ask me why I came late, and why I’m alone.” She said the only reason she was ultimately let through was because she told the officer that a person on the bus was her relative.

Women reported being harassed at checkpoints by officers, including verbally and physically. A woman who described being harassed by officers at multiple checkpoints around the south, said, “When I arrived at the first checkpoint in Al-Dhalea, I showed them five IDs for the university and the hospital that I work with in Sanaa, but they kept asking why I’m traveling alone and questioning what I’m doing in Sanaa, implying to unethical and dishonorable things. They continued harassing me very badly.”

Several women said that they had complained directly to the government and the STC but didn’t believe that either group had taken any action to address their complaints.

Dr. Olfat Al-Dubai, a prominent Yemeni women’s rights activist, said that the Yemeni government is aware of the violations and problems women are facing, but are not doing anything to respond to them. “[Civil society organizations] are reporting these violations to them regularly, but the government doesn't do anything to stop these behaviors and violations,” she said. “I myself submitted an official complaint to the prime minister about the incitement campaign against women, but they did nothing … they claim that they care about women’s rights, but in reality they are doing nothing in response to the challenges and the violations women are facing.”

She added that the government agencies concerned with women have failed to address violations against women, including the Ministry of Human Rights, the National Committee of Women, and the Ministry of Religious Endowments, none of which have done anything to halt these violations.

Harm Caused by Movement Restrictions

Male guardianship policies deprive women of their legal status to make decisions about their own lives and can cause deep harm. Discriminatory restrictions on women’s mobility within their country and to travel abroad violate women’s rights to freedom of movement, work, and study, to access health care, and to marry.

“My wedding is in December, and I can't travel,” one woman said. “That's why I'm sitting here planning and thinking about how I can get to Aden because I don't have a male guardian who can take me from Sanaa to Aden.”

Movement restrictions have also taken a mental health toll on women. “Travel becomes a big thing that must be well planned, and women must think a thousand times before making the decision [to travel],” another woman said.

Many women described how the movement restrictions have affected their work, and the work of their colleagues and friends.

“I had a colleague from al-Hudaydah who used to come from al-Hudaydah to Aden for training opportunities,” said one woman. “[Checkpoint officers] turned her away from the checkpoints multiple times … she was deprived of participating in these training programs.”

A pharmacist living in Aden said, “Many [job] opportunities have come my way, but I couldn’t seize them due to the challenges with travel.”

Women said that checkpoint officers, both in the north and the south, specifically target women believed to be working with nongovernmental organizations. “At checkpoints, they ask us whether we are affiliated with organizations or not, and if we say yes, they conduct harsher interrogations, which may lead to additional risks,” one woman said.

The restrictions have also had critical impacts on aid agencies, including on women who have jobs with these organizations who must travel to various areas of Yemen; on families who rely on humanitarian aid; and on aid assessments that include the needs of women and girls. In their letter to the Houthis regarding the requirement to be accompanied by a male relative, several UN special rapporteurs said that “[i]nability to travel means critical work tasks cannot be performed, which leads to loss of work experience, and there are many reports of female aid workers leaving employment and therefore losing much needed income for their families.”

They also said that the requirements are “effectively cutting off” Yemeni women and girls from receiving humanitarian aid … as it is generally considered inappropriate for male staff to deliver support.”

The increase of restrictions on women’s movement has also limited women’s access to education, particularly as many women in Yemen must travel to larger cities like Aden, Taizz, and Sanaa to attend a university. A student living in Taizz said that, “Women's opportunities to pursue higher education are very limited, and there are very few options, and even with these very few options women are restricted by requirements for a male relaive.”

One woman desribed her diffculty in continuing to attend college after her brother died in 2019. “After my brother’s death, I wanted to travel, and there was no one who could travel with me, especially with my father’s deteriorating health. I contacted my family, my paternal and maternal uncles, but due to divisions and fear of traveling to areas under the control of Ansar Allah, they refused to travel with me. My cousin said, ‘We are not male relatives to travel with you.’”

She said that on one of her visits back home from her university in 2022, she was stopped at al-Hangar checkpoint in Taizz and asked where her male relative was. She stated it was only after she was able to verify that she had family in Taizz that they let her through.

The woman who lives in Taizz, wanted to travel to Sanaa to attend graduate school in 2022, but said that her father refused because he was concerned about her safety traveling back and forth between the two cities. She said that her father told her, “I can’t let you go there, it is not safe. How can you freely travel back and forth through the checkpoints? It will pose a big risk for you, especially since we can’t afford to pay a relative’s expenses each time.”

The requirements also have an impact on women’s health, as many women must travel to other governorates, or even abroad, for health care. One woman said that her aunt, who is an older woman, needs a male relaive to escort her back and forth between Houthi-controlled Taizz and government-controlled Taizz to get treatment. She stated that once, her mother’s health deteriorated and she needed to go to the hospital, but she had to wait for her son to first travel from Sanaa to Hawban in Taizz (a 6-8 hour journey) to then take her.

The UN Panel of Experts on Yemen and the World Health Organization, among other international actors, have described the severe impacts that movement restrictions have had on women’s abilities to access health services. According to the International Rescue Committee, “Lifesaving and urgent services, including for sexual and reproductive health, the treatment of sexual violence related injuries, and the prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, cannot reach women and girls who need them.”

Legal Obligations

Yemen’s constitution provides that “all citizens are equal in rights and duties,” and that “freedom of movement from one place to another within the country is guaranteed for all citizens and may not be restricted except by law and for reasons necessitated by the security and safety of the people. The law shall regulate entry and exit from Yemen.”

Restrictions on women’s movement also violate international human rights law. Yemen is a state party to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the Arab Charter on Human Rights, all of which obligate states to ensure freedom of movement and nondiscrimination, including to enter one’s own country and to leave any country, including their own, and freedom of movement within the country.

Discriminatory movement restrictions also breach women’s right to equality before the law, as well as their related rights including to work, study, marry, access health care, provide care to their children in their child’s best interests on an equal basis with men, and be free from violence.

The Houthis and the STC, as armed non-state groups that exercise de facto control over territory and populations, are obligated to respect and protect the human rights of individuals and groups living under their territory. The Houthis have controlled large swathes of Yemen since 2014, and the STC controls Aden, as well as other areas in southern Yemen, and both exercise significant governance-like functions. Their control over these territories obligates them to protect the right to freedom of movement for those living within their territories.",HIGH,20240304T051500Z,Human Rights Watch,Niku Jafarnia,"Houthis, Yemeni government, Southern Transitional Council (STC)",Yemen,"End policies restricting women’s movement, ensure rights protection training for officers",Systematic violations of women’s right to freedom of movement,Yemen,"Cultural and historical discrimination against women, policies of armed groups"

Nearly 100 years ago in June 1924, the US Congress passed the Indian Citizenship Act, granting citizenship to the Indigenous peoples who had long lived on the land that became the United States. Nonetheless, some US states regularly denied Native citizens the right to vote through the 1960s, with Maine, Utah, and New Mexico being the last states to grant all Native citizens the right to vote. Even today some states continue to pass discriminatory legislation that violates the fundamental human right to vote.

Additionally, the US Supreme Court has eviscerated checks on discrimination, disempowering Native and other voters of color.

Despite this, Native people in Nevada offer an inspiring example of resistance and progress. In February, Tribal advocates in Nevada celebrated their first presidential primary with expanded voting rights, including the ability to register and vote with a Tribal ID and the creation of automatic on-reservation polling places – products of Indigenous-led organizing, legislation, and litigation.

A Tribal leader told Human Rights Watch that, for the first time during a presidential election, the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes of Duck Valley have an on-reservation polling place. Previously, Tribal members drove nearly two-hours roundtrip to vote. Native advocates have long expressed the view, confirmed by our own research, that voting in-person, at polling places on or near reservation land, is particularly important for Native voters who distrust US government systems.

Despite this win, according to Tribal leaders, the Tribe faces implementation issues as the majority white Elko County, where the reservation is located, neglects to fully ensure in-person voting rights by failing to offer equal training for Tribal poll workers, pay a Tribal poll worker promptly, and assist in ballot box removal.

For centuries, Indigenous communities in the US have endured human rights abuses. States like Utah, Wyoming, New Mexico, North Dakota, and South Dakota have a long history of discriminating against Native voters and, since 2020, have adopted measures and legislation that disenfranchise Native voters. Beyond these technical legislative barriers, Native voters face systemic racism and marginalization.

At the centennial of the Indian Citizenship Act, marked by a US presidential election year, US states and the federal government should enact legislation to protect and expand voting rights for Native people. Federal protections should include passing the Native American Voting Rights Act. State and local level officials should ensure on or near reservation in-person polling locations, allow for the full use of Tribal IDs, and ensure Tribes have equitable and accessible access to electoral procedures.",HIGH,20240304T144500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Tribal advocates, Tribal leaders, Native voters",US states and the federal government,"Moapa River Indian Reservation, Nevada","Enact legislation to protect and expand voting rights for Native people, pass the Native American Voting Rights Act.",Discriminatory legislation violating voting rights of Native citizens,United States,"Systemic racism, historical discrimination against Native voters"

This year, for the first time since 1953, Christians in Indonesia will finally be able to officially use Indonesian terminology for Jesus Christ, Yesus Kristus, when they celebrate the major Christian holidays of Good Friday, Easter Sunday, and Christmas. In a victory for freedom of religion and belief, the government is no longer insisting on the use of the Arabic term Isa al Masih for Jesus Christ during major Christian holidays, which the Indonesian state had imposed for the past seven decades.

The recognition came in January, when a joint decree on the change was signed by three government ministers: Minister of Manpower Ida Fauziyah, Minister of State Apparatus Empowerment and Bureaucratic Reform Abdullah Azwar Anas, and Minister of Religious Affairs Yaqut Cholil Quomas. President Joko Widodo signaled his support for the change when he announced this year’s annual holidays, using Yesus Kristus in his announcement rather than Isa al Masih.

Deputy Minister of Religious Affairs Saiful Rahmat Dasuki said that Indonesian Christians had requested the change in nomenclature: “They want a change, using 'Yesus Kristus' in the commemoration of his birth, death, and ascension.”

Left unanswered is why successive Indonesian governments took so long to lift this unnecessary and oppressive requirement on Indonesian Christians’ terminology. In daily practice, including in Sunday services, Indonesian Christians rarely used the Arabic term, choosing the Indonesian version instead, highlighting the unreasonableness of the government’s insistence on the use of the Arabic term during festivities.

Indonesia has two major Bible publishing houses: the Indonesia Bible Society (Lembaga Alkitab Indonesia), which is jointly owned by various Protestant denominations, and the Indonesian Biblical Institute (Lembaga Biblika Indonesia), controlled by the Roman Catholic church. Alongside the Indonesian language, they also translate the Christian Bible into hundreds of Indonesia’s ethnic languages. Both publishers have traditionally used the term Yesus Kristus, despite the government not officially recognizing it.

Gomar Gultom, the chairman of the Communion of Churches in Indonesia, thanked the government for finally “ending the confusion” around the two different names for Jesus Christ. By this step, the Indonesian government could be indicating greater recognition of the rights to freedom of religion and belief, and this small but important step might serve as a precursor for more far-reaching reforms that can protect religious rights for everybody.",LOW,20240306T034500Z,Indonesian Christian Community,"Minister of Manpower Ida Fauziyah, Minister of State Apparatus Empowerment and Bureaucratic Reform Abdullah Azwar Anas, Minister of Religious Affairs Yaqut Cholil Quomas, President Joko Widodo, Deputy Minister of Religious Affairs Saiful Rahmat Dasuki, Gomar Gultom",Indonesian Government,"Bogor, Indonesia",Monitor and support continued reforms for freedom of religion in Indonesia.,Imposition of the Arabic term Isa al Masih on Indonesian Christians instead of Yesus Kristus,Indonesia,Cultural and political history of religious terminology in Indonesia

The Malaysian government is detaining about 12,000 migrants and refugees, including 1,400 children, in conditions that put them at serious risk of physical abuse and psychological harm.

Malaysia’s degrading and abusive immigration detention system, which treats migrants and refugees as criminals, denies them their rights to liberty, health, and due process.

Malaysia should develop community-based alternatives to detention that would make the immigration system more cost-effective, efficient, and humane.

(Kuala Lumpur) – The Malaysian government is detaining about 12,000 migrants and refugees, including 1,400 children, in conditions that put them at serious risk of physical abuse and psychological harm, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today.

The 60-page report, “‘We Can’t See the Sun’: Malaysia’s Arbitrary Detention of Migrants and Refugees,” documents Malaysian authorities’ punitive and abusive treatment of migrants and refugees in 20 immigration detention centers across the country. Immigration detainees can spend months or years in overcrowded, unhygienic conditions, subject to harassment and violence by guards, without domestic or international monitoring.

“Malaysian authorities are treating migrants as criminals, arbitrarily holding them for prolonged periods in immigration centers with almost no access to the outside world,” said Shayna Bauchner Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Malaysia’s degrading and abusive immigration detention system denies migrants and refugees rights to liberty, health, and due process.”

Human Rights Watch interviewed more than 40 people, including former immigration detainees, family members, lawyers, humanitarian aid staff, and former immigration officials.

Malaysian law makes all irregular entry and stay in the country a criminal offense, with no distinction among refugees, asylum seekers, trafficking victims, and undocumented migrants. There is also no legal limit on the length of immigration detention, leaving migrants at risk of being detained indefinitely. Authorities have detained more than 45,000 irregular migrants since May 2020.

Former detainees described a bare and brutal existence inside the immigration detention centers, also called depots, with limited food and hygiene supplies, frequent water shortages, strict and unpredictable rules, and the ever-present threat of punishment. “We would get beaten when we asked for more food, took an extra mug of water to shower, or asked for a blanket for the cold,” said a Rohingya refugee previously detained at the Belantik immigration depot.

Detainees are required to present themselves for “muster calls,” or roll calls, several times a day. Some last hours, with detainees ordered to stay silent, heads down and not moving, even to use the bathroom. “If we made any noise, we would be punished, like hanging from the wall, pushups, squats, walking like ducks, or standing under the hot sun for hours,” said an Indonesian woman held in the Tawau immigration depot.

Migrants are held without recourse to judicial review or mechanisms to appeal their detention. The Malaysian government’s use of prolonged, judicially unsupervised immigration detention violates international human rights law prohibitions against arbitrary detention.

Both ill-treatment and inadequate medical care have led to hundreds of deaths in immigration detention facilities in recent years, according to government data and witness testimony. One migrant worker said that officers tortured him and thirteen others for days after they tried to escape, beating them with bricks and batons and standing on their chests. Two of the detainees ultimately died.

Anti-migrant policies and practices, as well as xenophobic rhetoric have risen in Malaysia in recent years.

The Malaysian government has denied the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, access to immigration detention centers since August 2019, leaving the organization unable to review asylum claims or protect detainees registered as refugees. Malaysia has not ratified the Refugee Convention and lacks any legal framework or procedure for determining refugee status and providing recognition and protection to asylum seekers.

Detained refugees and asylum seekers said that immigration officials used threats, degrading treatment, and violence to block requests to meet with the UN refugee agency or to coerce them to return to their countries of origin. When a UNHCR-registered ethnic Chin refugee and dozens of other refugees at the Ajil depot protested the lack of access to the UNHCR and threats of deportation, the guards beat them. “We were brought outside and beaten on our hands and feet five times with two rubber pipes that were taped together,” he said. “The pipes were filled with metal wires. I fainted after the third hit.”

Children detained in the immigration centers face the same abuses as adult detainees, including denial of medical care, inadequate food, and ill-treatment. Malnutrition is widespread.

The Malaysian government’s immigration detention of children contravenes international law. Although the government has for years discussed alternatives to detention for children – including in its pledges to the UN Human Rights Council – there has been little progress.

The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has called for immigration detention to be gradually abolished, stating that “migrants must not be qualified or treated as criminals,” and that immigration detention should only be used “as an exceptional measure of last resort, for the shortest period and only if justified by a legitimate purpose, such as documenting entry and recording claims or initial verification of identity if in doubt.”

The Malaysian government should reduce its reliance on immigration detention and move toward abolishing it entirely, Human Rights Watch said. The authorities should immediately stop detaining refugees, children, trafficking victims, and other vulnerable migrants for immigration-related reasons.

The government should instead pursue community-based alternatives to detention that would not only counteract abusive and unnecessary immigration detention, but also make the immigration system more cost-effective, efficient, and humane.

“Malaysia should seriously consider adopting measures used by other countries that better manage immigration objectives,” Bauchner said. “Instead of maintaining abusive detention centers, the government should develop alternatives that protect the rights of children, refugees, and other vulnerable migrants.”",HIGH,20240306T024500Z,Human Rights Watch,Shayna Bauchner (Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch),Malaysian government,Immigration detention centers across Malaysia,Develop community-based alternatives to detention; abolish immigration detention; ensure rights of children and vulnerable migrants.,Abusive treatment and arbitrary detention of migrants and refugees,Malaysia,Xenophobic rhetoric and anti-migrant policies in Malaysia

(Bangkok) – The Vietnamese authorities arrested three prominent critics just days after Vietnam announced its candidacy for another term on the United Nations Human Rights Council, Human Rights Watch said today. The police arrested Nguyen Chi Tuyen and Nguyen Vu Binh on February 29, 2024, and Hoang Viet Khanh on March 1, and charged them with conducting propaganda against the state.

The Vietnamese government should end its crackdown against bloggers, rights campaigners, and activists, and immediately release those held for exercising their basic civil and political rights. In 2022, the UN General Assembly elected Vietnam to a three-year term on the Human Rights Council in Geneva, which ends in 2025. It announced on February 26 that it will seek a new term when its term ends.

“The Vietnamese government likes to boast about its respect for human rights when seeking a seat on the UN Human Rights Council, but its brutal crushing of dissent sends the opposite message,” said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Despite Vietnam’s egregious treatment of rights advocates, the country’s donors and trade partners have done almost nothing to press the government about its rights abuses.”

Vietnam currently holds at least 163 political prisoners, Human Rights Watch said. During the first two months of 2024 alone, three activists – Danh Minh Quang, Nay Y Blang, and Phan Van Loc – were convicted and sentenced to between three years and six months, and seven years in prison. At least 24 other persons are in police custody on politically motivated charges awaiting trials.

The police arrested Nguyen Chi Tuyen (also known as Anh Chi), 49, on February 29 in Hanoi. He is a rights campaigner who uses social media, including YouTube and Facebook, to comment on social and political issues. His primary YouTube channel, Anh Chi Rau Den, has produced over 1,600 videos and is followed by 98,000 subscribers. His second YouTube channel, AC Media, has produced more than 1,000 videos and has almost 60,000 subscribers.

Nguyen Chi Tuyen was a founding member of the now closed No-U FC (No U-line Football Club), a soccer team whose members were outspoken against China’s territorial claims on maritime areas claimed by Vietnam. He helped organize and participated in many anti-China protests in the early 2010s, and pro-environmental protests in the mid-2010s. He joined fellow activists to provide humanitarian assistance to impoverished people in rural areas and victims of natural disasters.

He also openly supported imprisoned rights activists including Pham Doan Trang, Can Thi Theu, Nguyen Tuong Thuy, Nguyen Huu Vinh (Ba Sam), and Nguyen Lan Thang. Prior to Nguyen Lan Thang’s trial, Nguyen Chi Tuyen published an open letter in support of his friend. He wrote, “The only thing we did was to act in accordance with our conscience, speak up our thoughts, our desire, our longing.”

Nguyen Chi Tuyen has repeatedly faced police intimidation, harassment, house arrest, bans on international travel, arbitrary detention, and interrogations. In May 2015, five unidentified men attacked and beat him near his house in Hanoi. The attack left him with injuries that required stitches in his face. In February 2017, Nguyen Chi Tuyen and five fellow activists met a European Union human rights delegation in Hanoi to discuss the human rights situation in Vietnam. Of the six Vietnamese activists present that day, Pham Doan Trang and Nguyen Tuong Thuy are now serving long prison sentences. Two others, Vu Quoc Ngu and Nguyen Anh Tuan, fled the country to escape likely arrest.

Despite the risk of prosecution on politically motivated charges, Nguyen Chi Tuyen continued his campaign for human rights and democracy. In a 2017 interview on Mekong Review, he said, “[The Communist Party] have all the power in their hands. They have prisons, they have guns, policemen, army force, the court: they have everything. They have media. We have nothing except our hearts, and our minds. And we think it’s the right thing to do…that’s all.”

On February 29, the police also arrested Nguyen Vu Binh, 55, a former political prisoner, in Hanoi. After working as a journalist at the official Communist Party of Vietnam’s journal, Communist Review (Tap Chi Cong San), for almost 10 years, in December 2000 he resigned and attempted to form an independent political party. He was also one of several dissidents who attempted to form an anti-corruption association in 2001. Police arrested him in September 2002, alleging that he slandered the Vietnamese state in written testimony he provided to the US Congress in July 2002 regarding human rights abuses in Vietnam. The government also targeted him for his criticism of a controversial border treaty with China in an article distributed online in August 2002.

In his testimony, Nguyen Vu Binh wrote, “I always believe that when we can successfully stop and prevent human rights violations across the country we have also succeeded in democratizing this nation. Any measures to fight for human rights, therefore, should also aim for the ultimate goals aspired for so long by the Vietnamese people: individual liberty and a democratic society.”

In December 2003, a court sentenced Nguyen Vu Binh to seven years in prison, followed by three years of house arrest, for espionage under article 80 of Vietnam’s Criminal Law. In June 2007, the authorities pardoned and released him two years and three months early. He immediately resumed his advocacy for freedom, democracy, and human rights. He frequently commented on various social and political issues of Vietnam.

Between 2015 and 2024, Nguyen Vu Binh has published more than 300 entries on the Radio Free Asia Blog. In his latest entry , “Positive Aspects of the Democratic Movement During a Difficult and Gloomy Period,” published a week before his arrest, he said that human rights and democracy advocates in Vietnam support one another, and the families of fellow activists, amid the ongoing government crackdown.

Nguyen Vu Binh twice received the prestigious Hellmann/Hammett writers’ award for writers who have been victims of political persecution, in 2002, and 2007.

On March 1, police arrested Hoang Viet Khanh, 41, in Lam Dong province, in the Central Highlands region. He started using Facebook to express his opinions on various socio-political issues in Vietnam in 2018. He denounced police brutality and raised concerns about confessions extracted under torture in police custody. He publicly voiced support for political prisoners including Pham Chi Dung, Nguyen Tuong Thuy, Le Huu Minh Tuan, Le Chi Thanh, Le Trong Hung, and Le Van Dung.

Commenting on the trial of a citizen journalist, Le Van Dung, Hoang Viet Khanh said that by arresting people who use Facebook to express their opinions, the government aims to intimidate citizens so they would be “afraid to expose the truth unfavorable to the one-party regime.” He added that the ultimate goal of arrests of dissidents is “to intimidate and prevent citizens from exercising freedom of speech.”

When Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh first took office in 2021, Hoang Viet Khanh published his 10-point opinion, urging the prime minister to consider abolishing article 4 of Vietnam’s Constitution, which confirms the Communist Party’s leadership over the country.

The police accused him of using his Facebook page to “post, share and disseminate [information with] contents that bend the truth, distort and twist the actual situation, attack the guidelines and policies of the party and the state, distort history, defame and insult President Ho Chi Minh, [and] smear high-ranking leaders of the party and the state.”

“These three activists are not guilty of anything except exercising their basic rights to freedom of speech,” Robertson said. “Unfortunately, the Vietnamese government treats all online expression of peaceful political views as a dire threat to the ruling party and government, and crushes such dissent with politically motivated arrests, trials, and prison sentences.”",HIGH,20240305T231500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Nguyen Chi Tuyen, Nguyen Vu Binh, Hoang Viet Khanh",Vietnamese Government,"Hanoi, Lam Dong province","End crackdown on activists, respect human rights, release political prisoners",Conducting propaganda against the state,Vietnam,"Government crackdown on dissent, suppression of free speech"

(Kinshasa) – Democratic Republic of Congo President Félix Tshisekedi should ensure that human rights are central to his policies during his second term in office, Human Rights Watch said today in a “Human Rights Agenda” for his administration.



Human Rights Watch urged the Tshisekedi administration to prioritize improvements in five key areas: the rights to free expression, media freedom, and peaceful assembly; protecting civilians in conflict areas; reforming the justice system and addressing corruption; providing accountability for serious crimes; and strengthening democratic institutions.



“President Tshisekedi’s first term ended with deep uncertainty about the Congo’s worsening violence and humanitarian crises, recurrent violations of civil and political rights, and growing mistrust in democratic institutions,” said Thomas Fessy, senior Congo researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The second term is a chance to start afresh and reverse course on significant human rights backsliding.”



Tshisekedi, the declared winner of the December 2023 presidential elections, was sworn in on January 20, 2024, for a second and final five-year term. The elections were marred by logistical issues, irregularities, and violence.



Tshisekedi faces significant challenges, most immediately an uptick in violence in the eastern province of North Kivu, where an offensive by the abusive Rwanda-backed M23 armed group has dramatically affected civilians. Violence is also rife in Ituri province as militia fighters have increased attacks on and killings of civilians. Insecurity continues in and around the western province of Mai-Ndombe and among communities in the southern Katanga region.



The government has also significantly repressed the rights to free expression, media freedom, and peaceful assembly. The authorities have over the past four years increasingly cracked down—including online—on journalists, human rights and democracy activists, critics of the government, and opposition party members and officials. Security forces have repeatedly used unnecessary or excessive force, including lethal force, to block or disperse peaceful demonstrations.



Tshisekedi recently described the country’s justice system as “ill.” His administration should act to reform the justice system and address corruption, which significantly reduces the government’s capacity to deliver on its obligations to provide quality education, health care, and social security.



Widespread impunity for serious abuses remains the norm. The president should commit to take concrete measures to address recurring cycles of violence fueled by a lack of criminal accountability for grave crimes. Concrete steps are also needed to restore the Congolese people’s trust in democratic institutions.



“President Tshisekedi promised to address recurring violence, to end repression, and to improve the daily lives of all Congolese,” Fessy said. “The president should devote his second term to fulfilling these goals by working for, rather than against, human rights, the rule of law, and democratic principles.”",HIGH,20240306T093000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Félix Tshisekedi, Thomas Fessy",Félix Tshisekedi Administration,"North Kivu, Ituri, Mai-Ndombe, Katanga","Prioritize human rights in policy, reform justice system, provide accountability for crimes",Repression of human rights and failure to address violence and accountability for serious crimes,Democratic Republic of Congo,"Corruption, lack of criminal accountability, political repression"

Olga, a 45-yea r -old woman with cerebral palsy , seldom leaves her home to participate in gatherings with friends or other social activities. Besides going to the same school she’s attended since childhood, the only other outing she makes is to a summer camp. To take control over her life, Olga needs a support system that would enable her to study for a career, develop professionally, fully exercise her political rights, live independently , and be included in the community. These are fundamental rights everyone should have, including women with disabilities.

Since 2017, policymakers at the state and federal levels in Mexico have been discussing care and support policies that are key for addressing gender inequalities affecting women like Olga, as well as those facing older women. Additionally, women’s rights advocates in Mexico have pushed politicians to start taking issues around care and support seriously.

Recently, Jalisco was the first Mexican state to pass a law on care. While the adoption of this legislation is an achievement, it doesn’t align with the rights of people with disabilities and older people to live independently and be included in the community. This is especially important for women with disabilities and older women because of the greater risks they face of discrimination in the absence of legal protections.

Additionally, the legislation problematically portrays people with disabilities as dependent beings in need of care, despite existing international standards on how to create a respectful and rights-based care and support system. Jalisco’s congress did not adequately consult with organizations of people with disabilities to gather their input on the law’s content. Consultations are key to ensuring a comprehensive support system that rights holders can access, manage, and control, that also responds to gendered needs. Organizations of people with disabilities know best how to address different support needs, like Olga’s.

This International Women’s Day, policymakers should center the rights, needs, and voices of women with disabilities and older women – as well as consulting with and listening to them – in order to build strong public policies that uphold everyone’s rights to live independently and be included in their community. That way, care policies won’t go against good practices but will respond to the demands of those who will be impacted.",MEDIUM,20240308T123000Z,Women’s rights advocates in Mexico,"Olga, policymakers, Jalisco congress members",Mexican policymakers and Jalisco congress,"Iztapalapa, Mexico City and Jalisco, Mexico",Center the rights and needs of women with disabilities and older women in public policy.,Inadequate support policies for women with disabilities and older women,Mexico,"Gender inequalities, lack of legal protections for people with disabilities"

Every March 8, International Women’s Day, women flood the streets in countries around the world to commemorate hard-won victories for women’s rights and to fight for more. It’s a time to celebrate advances while sharing our frustrations about too-slow progress or even backsliding.

But we’re only able to express our joy and rage when we enjoy freedom of expression. Without it, realizing other rights is nearly impossible. When women can speak freely, we can advocate for our rights to education, work, vote, participate in political and public life, access abortion, and many more. When our rights are violated, as they often are, we can call for justice.

On this International Women’s Day, we march for the one in three women who experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime. We cheer for countries like Argentina, Colombia, and Ireland that value our autonomy to choose to be pregnant and have legalized access to safe abortion, while protesting that abortion is still or again illegal in many places, including US states like Alabama and Texas.

At the same time, we march to honor the women who marched before us, like the Mexican women who organized the first feminist congress in 1916 to push for family law reforms and their right to vote, and the Nigerians who waged their “Women’s War ” against colonization and patriarchal laws in 1929. Their struggles sadly mirror the reality of many women around the world today – especially women who belong to historically marginalized groups – who continue to rally against violence and abuse.

Fearing the power of women’s solidarity and collective actions, governments have stifled women’s speech through restrictions on movement, censorship, smear campaigns, and criminal prosecutions. In highly repressive contexts, like Afghanistan and Iran, women suffer arbitrary detention, and even enforced disappearance and torture, for their activism. Meanwhile, social media companies have not done enough to protect women from online violence, chilling women’s freedom of expression on and offline.

These barriers make it hard for women’s equality to become reality. Gender justice requires an enabling environment in which women can express themselves, speak and spread their political views, and participate in political and public life. Instead of repressing or tolerating the repression of women, governments should recognize our collective actions – and consequent power – and enshrine our rights in laws, policies, and practice.

As our climate burns out of control, too many politicians are dithering – and worse.

I get it. Reality is hard. It requires difficult decisions. It’s so much easier for politicians to present a fantasy world, to deny or downplay the science of human-driven climate change. And when anyone rejects your fantasy thinking and demands climate action, you simply use state power to shut them up.

Governments are increasingly turning to repression against those calling on their leaders to take steps to address the climate crisis. They are threatening environmental defenders in many parts of the world, using intimidation, legal harassment, and, absurdly, counterterrorism laws against climate activists. Sometimes, they even resort to deadly violence.

In Australia’s state of New South Wales, for example, the government created a new law targeting protesters who block roads or ports. The bizarre result is that activists who temporarily inconvenienced some people have been sent to maximum security prisons for months – meanwhile, people committing violent crimes like assault can avoid being sent to jail altogether.

In the UK, there’s also an ongoing crackdown on climate protesters. Recently enacted laws severely restrict people’s right to peaceful protest. In December, a peaceful climate protester who took part in a slow march on a public road for about 30 minutes, was sentenced to six months in prison.

Europe is likewise failing, with newly introduced repressive laws and practices in several countries. Authorities are targeting environmental movements, which are now sometimes labelled “terrorist threats,” and attacked them with legal prosecutions and police brutality.

A clampdown on environmental activism is happening elsewhere, too – Uganda, India, the list goes on.

But here’s the thing: repression doesn’t change the reality of the climate crisis. Harassment, arrests, imprisonment, killings... none of that slows humanity’s release of carbon into the atmosphere, which is the actual problem here.

(Berlin) – German Chancellor Olaf Scholz should stress the importance of human rights in the Sino-German relationship during his visit to China and meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Human Rights Watch said today. Scholz arrived in Beijing on April 13, 2024, and is expected to meet with Xi on April 16.

“Chancellor Scholz should not play second fiddle to Germany’s narrow business interests, but should lead by setting the Sino-German relationship on a rights-respecting footing,” said Wenzel Michalski, Germany director at Human Rights Watch. “Promoting human rights is good both for the Chinese people and for Germany’s long-term interests.”

Scholz last visited Beijing in November 2022, when he also brought along a large business delegation. Since then, Germany has issued a new China strategy in which it commits to responding to an increasingly assertive and abusive Chinese government by “de-risking,"" or reducing reliance on China for critical supply chains. The strategy also asserts that “[h]uman rights are at the heart of” German government policies toward China.

In an April 12 letter to the German chancellor, Human Rights Watch urged Scholz to make clear to Xi that the Sino-German relationship will suffer if Beijing does not address serious human rights violations in China. These include ending its crimes against humanity targeting Uyghurs and other Turkic communities in Xinjiang and freeing the hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs arbitrarily detained or imprisoned, including Rahile Dawut, a prominent expert on ethnography, and Ilham Tohti, Uyghur scholar and Sakharov Prize laureate.

Beijing should also revoke the two draconian national security laws in Hong Kong and release those wrongfully detained in mainland China, including human rights lawyer Yu Wensheng and his wife, Xu Yan.

In a 2022 public opinion poll in Germany, 68 percent of those who responded said that is it important for Germany to stand up for human rights when dealing with China.

“Scholz needs to put Germany’s China strategy into action by forthrightly putting human rights at the center of the Sino-German relationship,” Michalski said. “The German government should demonstrate its commitment by impressing upon Chinese leaders its principled and public support for the human rights of everyone in China.”",HIGH,20240415T093000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Rahile Dawut, Ilham Tohti, Yu Wensheng, Xu Yan",Chinese Government,"Xinjiang and Hong Kong, China",Chancellor Scholz should emphasize human rights in Sino-German relations.,Serious human rights violations targeting Uyghurs and other Turkic communities in Xinjiang,China,"China's authoritarian governance, cultural repression"

(Berlin, April 16, 2024) – Several people based in Lithuania, Poland, and Türkiye, linked to a banned Tajik opposition movement, Group 24, have in recent months disappeared or have been arrested and threatened with extradition to Tajikistan, Human Rights Watch and the Norwegian Helsinki Committee said today.

Group 24 is a political movement promoting democratic reforms in Tajikistan, which the Tajik government banned and designated a terrorist organization in October 2014. Tajikistan has for the last decade sought the extradition of exiled activists in other countries, some of whom also have been killed or forcibly disappeared. Host governments should not deport the people concerned to Tajikistan because of the risk of torture and should respect Tajik asylum seekers’ full due process rights, including not arbitrarily detaining them at the behest of unfounded and politically motivated requests by the Tajik government.

“Tajikistan should unequivocally end its decade-long hunt of perceived critics abroad, especially those related to Group 24 and other banned groups,” said Syinat Sultanalieva, Central Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The EU and Türkiye should protect opposition activists and refrain from returning them to Tajikistan, a country known for engaging in transnational repression, where they risk being tortured.”

Human Rights Watch recently published a report on transnational repression – targeting of critics abroad by repressive governments – that includes several cases of members of Group 24, both former and active, who had fled the country only to be targeted by the Tajik government, seeking their arrest and extradition to Tajikistan on charges of terrorism or extremism-related activities. Activists in exile have also been subject to enforced disappearances or abusive use of Interpol Red Notices, which is a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person because a government is seeking their extradition.

On April 5, 2024, Lithuanian security services detained Sulaimon Davlatov, a former member of Group 24, in Vilnius on charges of allegedly violating Lithuania’s national security. On April 7, a court in Vilnius ordered his pretrial detention for two months, and on April 9 the Lithuanian Prosecutor General’s office told the med ia that Davlatov “presents a threat to the national security of Lithuania due to his cooperation with members and allies of terrorist organizations, extremist movements and propaganda of extremism.”

Davlatov has been a resident of Lithuania since he was granted asylum in 2015. Lithuanian authorities should rule out any risk that Davlatov could be extradited to Tajikistan, and in line with fair trial rights, grant Davlatov and his lawyer immediate access to any evidence they have to substantiate the allegations.

On February 23 and March 10 respectively, two senior figures in Group 24, Nasimjon Sharifov and Sukhrob Zafar, disappeared in Türkiye. Both had previously been detained by the Turkish police in March 2018 at the request of Tajik authorities and threatened with extradition but were eventually released. They had recently told family and colleagues that they were receiving regular threats from Tajik intelligence services. Neither man’s whereabouts is currently known. Friends and colleagues are concerned that they may have been forcibly disappeared by either or both Tajik and Turkish authorities and extrajudicially removed to Tajikistan.

On March 19, a court in Poland ordered Komron Khudoydodov, brother of former Group 24 activist Shabnam Khudoydodova, to leave Poland by April 19 voluntarily or be deported to Tajikistan. This followed the rejection of his application for asylum. Khudoydodov moved to Poland in 2018 on a humanitarian visa from the Polish authorities granted because he faced persecution in Tajikistan due to his sister’s peaceful political activity. In 2015 , Tajik authorities had Shabnam Khudoydodova placed on the Interpol Red Notices on charges of extremism.

Tajik authorities also have an ongoing criminal investigation against Komron Khudoydodov on charges of extremism. Returning Khudoydodov to Tajikistan would place him at risk of torture or ill-treatment, and therefore be a violation of the ban on refoulement. Poland should make clear that it will abide by its international legal obligations and rule out deporting Khudoydodov to Tajikistan.

In addition to Lithuania and Poland, other European Union members, such as Austria, Germany, and Slovakia , have in recent years returned or threatened to return Tajik asylum seekers to Tajikistan despite credible evidence of their risk of being tortured. Upon their arrival in Tajikistan, those deported from the EU member states have been jailed.

The United Nations Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, prohibits the expulsion, return (refoulment), or extradition of a person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that they would be in danger of being tortured. The European Convention on Human Rights also incorporates this ban as an element of the prohibition on torture and inhuman and degrading treatment. All EU member countries and Türkiye are party to both treaties. This principle is also incorporated into Lithuanian, Polish, and Turkish domestic law.

“EU member states and Türkiye should uphold their international human rights obligations, including not to return people at risk of torture and persecution for their political activism to their country of origin,” Sultanalieva said. “They should denounce cases of transnational repression and review any cooperation agreements with states engaged in targeting critics abroad.”",HIGH,20240416T014500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Sulaimon Davlatov, Nasimjon Sharifov, Sukhrob Zafar, Komron Khudoydodov",Tajikistan government,"Lithuania, Poland, Türkiye","EU and Türkiye should protect activists, uphold human rights obligations, and denounce transnational repression.",Transnational repression targeting critics abroad,Tajikistan,"Political repression by Tajik government, designation of Group 24 as a terrorist organization"

Next week in Ottawa, countries will reconvene to continue negotiations on an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution. A revised draft of the treaty published by the United Nations Environment Programme on December 28, 2023, contains certain positive measures to reduce plastic production. However, it lacks the necessary provisions to protect human rights and health from the impacts of plastic pollution, especially for frontline communities and those who are most vulnerable.

The draft proposes options to address the full life cycle of plastics, from reducing production to eliminating the use of the most hazardous chemicals to improve plastic safety. However, it promotes higher recycling rates to increase producer responsibility without accounting for the human rights and health harm associated with recycling. It also overlooks a significant element of plastic production: fossil fuels. Ninety-nine percent of plastics are made from fossil fuels, which are also the primary driver of the climate crisis.

US: Louisiana’s ‘Cancer Alley’ Dire Health Crisis From Government Failure to Rein in Fossil Fuels

In January, a Human Rights Watch report found that communities living alongside fossil fuel and petrochemical operations, including those producing the feedstocks for plastics, in Louisiana, United States, suffer elevated risks and rates of severe health harm, including cancer, respiratory ailments, and maternal, reproductive, and newborn health harm. This area has come to be known as “Cancer Alley” due to parts of it bearing the highest risks of cancer from industrial air pollution in the country. In Cancer Alley, health harm from fossil fuel operations disproportionally impacts Black residents.

Previously, Human Rights Watch documented the harmful impacts of plastic recycling in Turkey, where people living near recycling facilities suffer respiratory and skin ailments from pollutants and toxins emitted from plastic recycling. The treaty should not promote higher recycling rates without outlining measures to mitigate human rights and health impacts linked to recycling.

Governments are obligated under international human rights law to respect, protect, and fulfill all human rights, including the rights to health and to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment.

Germany's economy is very dependent on China, so expectations were low that Chancellor Olaf Scholz would place human rights concerns prominently on the agenda of his April 13-16 trip to China. But his apparent unwillingness to publicly say the words “human rights” was deeply disappointing.

The Chinese government’s long-egregious human rights record has become dramatically more repressive since Xi Jinping took power in 2013. Thousands of critics of the government are behind bars. The government oppresses and surveils the Tibetan and Uyghur populations and for years has actively suppressed their language, culture, and religion. In recent years, Beijing has deprived the people of Hong Kong’s fundamental freedoms.

Scholz’s three days in China were longer than any of his previous trips since taking office. He came with a huge entourage, consisting of the heads of the largest and most renowned German companies, as well as federal ministers, state secretaries, and the media. He spoke for hours with Xi, campaigned for freer trade for German industries, and sought Chinese support on key foreign policy issues, including over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He assured journalists that he had addressed ""all the difficult issues,"" but did not once mention “human rights.”

Sino-German relations are complicated. But even evaluated against its own metrics, the new German China Strategy, the German chancellor did not achieve its aims. The strategy recognizes China as a security threat and geopolitical competitor from which Germany should “de-risk,” and that the two countries’ relations should be rules-based and values-driven. This broadened Sino-German relations from their traditional focus on improving market access for German industries to a more multifaceted one.

But sadly, the German China Strategy proved to be nothing but hollow words. Germany’s experience with Vladimir Putin’s Russia should have made it clear that abusive governments make unreliable trade partners. Instead of steering Sino-German relations on a new course consistent with its own strategy by publicly promoting respect for human rights, Scholz defaulted to the well-worn path that will not further Germany’s long-term interests nor the basic human rights of the people in China.",VERY HIGH,20240418T133000Z,Chancellor Olaf Scholz,"Chancellor Olaf Scholz, President Xi Jinping",Chinese government,China,Promote respect for human rights in trade relations with China,"Egregious human rights abuses including oppression and surveillance of Tibetan and Uyghur populations, suppression of freedoms in Hong Kong",China,"Geopolitical competition, economic dependencies"

The 80-page report, “Destroying Cultural Heritage: Explosive Weapons’ Effects in Armed Conflict and Measures to Improve Protection,” details both the immediate and long-term harm from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas on cultural heritage, such as historic buildings and houses of worship, museums and archives, public squares, and performance centers. It shows that the Declaration on explosive weapons could serve as a valuable tool for addressing the problem.

“Governments should recognize that using explosive weapons in populated areas endangers cultural heritage as well as the people who cherish it,” said Bonnie Docherty, senior arms adviser at Human Rights Watch and a lecturer on law at the Harvard Clinic. “To preserve this heritage for future generations, parties to armed conflicts should abide by the 2022 Political Declaration and refrain from bombing and shelling populated urban areas.”

When used in populated areas, explosive weapons, such as aerial bombs, artillery projectiles, rockets, and missiles, kill and injure civilians and destroy civilian objects at the time of attack. These weapons also have long-term indirect, or “reverberating,” effects that aggravate civilian suffering. By harming cultural heritage, the weapons erase history, undermine community identity and unity, and have financial costs.

Human Rights Watch and the Harvard Clinic interviewed 17 experts and affected civilians, reviewed primary and secondary sources, and conducted legal analysis.

They examined Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine to illustrate the vulnerability of cultural heritage to explosive weapons in populated areas. They surveyed five examples – including local museums and archives, cultural sites in urban centers, and places of worship – that highlight the frequency, diversity, and gravity of the effects of explosive weapons on cultural heritage, and why these effects matter to the civilian population.

The researchers also drew on examples from other armed conflicts, notably Gaza and Yemen, to differentiate and elaborate on the direct and indirect harm to places and people that this method of war causes.

“The use of explosive weapons causes heartbreaking loss to sites and objects that may be treasured locally or globally,” Docherty said. “The damage also strikes at the heart of a nation’s people, who expect to pass their cultural heritage from one generation to the next.”

Since November 18, 2022, 86 countries have endorsed the Declaration, which sets standards for preventing and remediating the effects of the use of explosive weapons in populated areas.

Countries should interpret the Declaration and put it into practice to maximize the protection of cultural heritage, Human Rights Watch and the Harvard Clinic said. In addition to avoiding the use of explosive weapons in populated areas, countries should, for example, train soldiers to recognize and understand the significance of local cultural heritage, collect and share data related to cultural heritage damage, and allow preservation experts immediate access to affected sites.

By taking such steps, parties to armed conflicts can bolster safeguards for cultural heritage laid out in existing international law. In practice, these steps can better protect both cultural heritage and civilians.

“Countries should join the Declaration on explosive weapons and use it to maximize its humanitarian impact,” Docherty said. “By implementing its protections for cultural heritage, countries will also benefit civilians and hopefully reduce the long-term horrors of war.”",HIGH,20240418T081500Z,Human Rights Watch and Harvard Law School’s International Human Rights Clinic,Bonnie Docherty,Russian forces,"Skovorodynivka, Kharkivska region, Ukraine",Countries should avoid using explosive weapons in populated areas; train soldiers on cultural heritage significance; allow preservation experts access to affected sites.,Bombing and shelling of cultural heritage and populated areas,Ukraine,Armed conflict; use of explosive weapons in populated areas

(Berlin, April 16, 2024) – Several people based in Lithuania, Poland, and Türkiye, linked to a banned Tajik opposition movement, Group 24, have in recent months disappeared or have been arrested and threatened with extradition to Tajikistan, Human Rights Watch and the Norwegian Helsinki Committee said today.

Group 24 is a political movement promoting democratic reforms in Tajikistan, which the Tajik government banned and designated a terrorist organization in October 2014. Tajikistan has for the last decade sought the extradition of exiled activists in other countries, some of whom also have been killed or forcibly disappeared. Host governments should not deport the people concerned to Tajikistan because of the risk of torture and should respect Tajik asylum seekers’ full due process rights, including not arbitrarily detaining them at the behest of unfounded and politically motivated requests by the Tajik government.

“Tajikistan should unequivocally end its decade-long hunt of perceived critics abroad, especially those related to Group 24 and other banned groups,” said Syinat Sultanalieva, Central Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The EU and Türkiye should protect opposition activists and refrain from returning them to Tajikistan, a country known for engaging in transnational repression, where they risk being tortured.”

Human Rights Watch recently published a report on transnational repression – targeting of critics abroad by repressive governments – that includes several cases of members of Group 24, both former and active, who had fled the country only to be targeted by the Tajik government, seeking their arrest and extradition to Tajikistan on charges of terrorism or extremism-related activities. Activists in exile have also been subject to enforced disappearances or abusive use of Interpol Red Notices, which is a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person because a government is seeking their extradition.

On April 5, 2024, Lithuanian security services detained Sulaimon Davlatov, a former member of Group 24, in Vilnius on charges of allegedly violating Lithuania’s national security. On April 7, a court in Vilnius ordered his pretrial detention for two months, and on April 9 the Lithuanian Prosecutor General’s office told the med ia that Davlatov “presents a threat to the national security of Lithuania due to his cooperation with members and allies of terrorist organizations, extremist movements and propaganda of extremism.”

Davlatov has been a resident of Lithuania since he was granted asylum in 2015. Lithuanian authorities should rule out any risk that Davlatov could be extradited to Tajikistan, and in line with fair trial rights, grant Davlatov and his lawyer immediate access to any evidence they have to substantiate the allegations.

On February 23 and March 10 respectively, two senior figures in Group 24, Nasimjon Sharifov and Sukhrob Zafar, disappeared in Türkiye. Both had previously been detained by the Turkish police in March 2018 at the request of Tajik authorities and threatened with extradition but were eventually released. They had recently told family and colleagues that they were receiving regular threats from Tajik intelligence services. Neither man’s whereabouts is currently known. Friends and colleagues are concerned that they may have been forcibly disappeared by either or both Tajik and Turkish authorities and extrajudicially removed to Tajikistan.

On March 19, a court in Poland ordered Komron Khudoydodov, brother of former Group 24 activist Shabnam Khudoydodova, to leave Poland by April 19 voluntarily or be deported to Tajikistan. This followed the rejection of his application for asylum. Khudoydodov moved to Poland in 2018 on a humanitarian visa from the Polish authorities granted because he faced persecution in Tajikistan due to his sister’s peaceful political activity. In 2015 , Tajik authorities had Shabnam Khudoydodova placed on the Interpol Red Notices on charges of extremism.

Tajik authorities also have an ongoing criminal investigation against Komron Khudoydodov on charges of extremism. Returning Khudoydodov to Tajikistan would place him at risk of torture or ill-treatment, and therefore be a violation of the ban on refoulement. Poland should make clear that it will abide by its international legal obligations and rule out deporting Khudoydodov to Tajikistan.

In addition to Lithuania and Poland, other European Union members, such as Austria, Germany, and Slovakia , have in recent years returned or threatened to return Tajik asylum seekers to Tajikistan despite credible evidence of their risk of being tortured. Upon their arrival in Tajikistan, those deported from the EU member states have been jailed.

The United Nations Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, prohibits the expulsion, return (refoulment), or extradition of a person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that they would be in danger of being tortured. The European Convention on Human Rights also incorporates this ban as an element of the prohibition on torture and inhuman and degrading treatment. All EU member countries and Türkiye are party to both treaties. This principle is also incorporated into Lithuanian, Polish, and Turkish domestic law.

“EU member states and Türkiye should uphold their international human rights obligations, including not to return people at risk of torture and persecution for their political activism to their country of origin,” Sultanalieva said. “They should denounce cases of transnational repression and review any cooperation agreements with states engaged in targeting critics abroad.”",HIGH,20240417T083000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Sulaimon Davlatov, Nasimjon Sharifov, Sukhrob Zafar, Komron Khudoydodov, Shabnam Khudoydodova",Tajik government,"Lithuania, Poland, Türkiye, Tajikistan",EU and Türkiye should uphold human rights obligations and protect political activists.,Transnational repression of exiled activists,Tajikistan,"Political repression, designation of Group 24 as a terrorist organization"

(Jerusalem) – The Israeli military either took part in or did not protect Palestinians from violent settler attacks in the West Bank that have displaced people from 20 communities and have entirely uprooted at least 7 communities since October 7, 2023, Human Rights Watch said today.

Israeli settlers have assaulted, tortured, and committed sexual violence against Palestinians, stolen their belongings and livestock, threatened to kill them if they did not leave permanently, and destroyed their homes and schools under the cover of the ongoing hostilities in Gaza. Many Palestinians, including entire communities, have fled their homes and lands. The military has not assured displaced residents that it will protect their security or allow them to return, forcing them to live in precarious conditions elsewhere.

“Settlers and soldiers have displaced entire Palestinian communities, destroying every home, with the apparent backing of higher Israeli authorities,” said Bill Van Esveld, associate children’s rights director at Human Rights Watch. “While the attention of the world is focused on Gaza, abuses in the West Bank, fueled by decades of impunity and complacency among Israel’s allies, are soaring.”

Human Rights Watch investigated attacks that forcibly displaced all residents of Khirbet Zanuta and Khirbet al-Ratheem south of Hebron, al-Qanub east of Hebron, and Ein al-Rashash and Wadi al-Seeq, east of Ramallah, in October and November 2023. The evidence shows that armed settlers, with the active participation of army units, repeatedly cut off road access and raided Palestinian communities, detained, assaulted, and tortured residents, chased them out of their homes and off their lands at gunpoint or coerced them to leave with death threats, and blocked them from taking their belongings.

Human Rights Watch spoke to 27 witnesses of the attacks, and viewed videos that residents filmed, showing harassment by men in Israeli military uniforms carrying M16 assault rifles. As of April 16, the Israel Defense Forces did not reply to questions Human Rights Watch sent by email on April 7.

Settler attacks on Palestinians increased in 2023 to their highest level since the UN began recording this data in 2006. This was the case even before the Hamas-led attacks on October 7 that killed about 1,100 people inside Israel.

Following October 7, the Israeli military called up 5,500 settlers who are Israeli army reservists, including some with criminal records of violence against Palestinians, and assigned them to West Bank “regional defense” battalions. The authorities distributed 7,000 guns to battalion members and others, including “civilian security squads” established in settlements, according to Haaretz, and Israeli rights groups. Media reported that settlers left leaflets and sent threats on social media to Palestinians after October 7, such as warnings to “flee to Jordan” or be “exterminate[d],” and that “the day of revenge is coming.”

The UN has recorded more than 700 settler attacks between October 7 and April 3, with soldiers in uniform present in nearly half of the attacks. Attacks since October 7 have displaced over 1,200 people, including 600 children, from rural herding communities. At least 17 Palestinians were killed and 400 wounded, while Palestinians have killed 7 settlers in the West Bank since October 7, the UN reported.

On April 12, the body of a 14-year-old Israeli boy was found after he had disappeared from the settlement outpost of Malachei Hashalom. Since then, settlers have attacked at least 17 Palestinian villages and communities in the West Bank, according to OCHA . Yesh Din, an Israeli human rights group, reported that four Palestinians, including a 16-year-old boy, have been killed in these incidents, and that houses and vehicles were set on fire, and livestock killed.

None of those evicted from the five communities investigated have been able to return, Human Rights Watch found. The Israeli military either rejected or did not answer requests to allow residents to return, leaving Palestinians without protection from the same armed settlers and soldiers who threatened to kill them if they returned. One family with seven children, forced to flee on foot from al-Qanub, now lives in a small cinderblock storeroom with no money to pay the rent.

Haqel: In Defense of Human Rights, an Israeli human rights organization, petitioned the Israeli High Court to instruct the army to protect five Palestinian communities from threats of displacement due to settler violence, and to allow Khirbet Zanuta families to return to their lands. The Israeli state attorney’s February 20 response claimed that no forced displacement occurred in Khirbet Zanuta, and that Palestinians had left voluntarily due to herding and agricultural problems, according to Haqel. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for May 1.

The displaced residents raised sheep. Some said that Israeli attackers stole vehicles, cash, and household appliances, as well as sheep and fodder that families had bought on credit and now cannot repay. Other families escaped with their flocks but had to build new shelters and have nowhere to graze them.

Settlers have subsequently been grazing their own sheep on the communities’ lands, according to rights groups. The Israeli rights group B’Tselem reported that as of mid-March, settlers had taken over 4,000 dunams (about 988 acres) of Palestinian grazing lands since October 7.

Repeated settler attacks, often at night, have caused fear and mental health harm. Children and their parents said children have had nightmares and difficulty concentrating. The attacks destroyed schools in two of the five communities. Most children were unable to go to school for a month or longer after being displaced.

The Israeli police have law-enforcement jurisdiction over settlers, while the army has jurisdiction over Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. After October 7, Israel’s National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir instructed police not to enforce the law against violent settlers, an Israeli investigative journalist reported. Police denied the report, though Ben-Gvir did not. The vast majority of Palestinian complaints against settlers and the Israeli military do not result in indictments, based on official data compiled by Yesh Din.

After October 7, the National Security Ministry distributed thousands of guns, including to settlers. In December, the Attorney General’s Office stated in the Knesset that they had found the Ministry had unlawfully approved 14,000 firearms permits.

Countries including the United States, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom have licensed exports of weapons, including assault rifles and ammunition, to Israel. The US has approved more than 100 weapons transfers to Israel since October 7, and exported 8,000 military rifles and 43,000 handguns in 2023, before pausing a shipment of 24,000 assault rifles in December over concerns about settler attacks. It is “almost a certainty” that settlers are using US-made guns, a former US State Department official said.

Since December, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France announced visa policies that barred some violent settlers from entry. The US and UK imposed financial sanctions on a total of eight settlers and two settlement outposts. EU sanctions are still being discussed, due to staunch reluctance by the Czech Republic and Hungary.

Forcible transfer or deportation and the extensive destruction and appropriation of property in occupied territory are war crimes. Israeli authorities’ systematic oppression of and inhumane acts against Palestinians, including war crimes, committed with the intent to maintain the domination of Jewish Israelis over Palestinians, amount to the crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution.

Governments should suspend military support to Israel, given the risk of complicity in abuses. They should also review and possibly suspend bilateral agreements, such as the EU-Israel Association Agreement, and ban trade with settlements in the occupied territories. The UK should immediately withdraw the Economic Activity of Public Bodies (Overseas Matters) Bill, which restricts public bodies in the UK from deciding not to do business with companies’ operating in illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank.

The US, the EU, UK, and other countries should take action to ensure accountability for those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity, including criminal investigations and prosecutions under universal jurisdiction and at the International Criminal Court. This should include those responsible under command responsibility for failures to prevent or punish crimes by those in their chain of command.

In addition, they should consider sanctions on those responsible for ongoing Israeli attacks on Palestinian communities or for the prevention of displaced Palestinians from returning to their lands, until those subject to sanctions end the attacks and ensure the displaced Palestinians can return, Human Rights Watch said.

“Palestinian children have seen their families brutalized, and their homes and schools destroyed, and the Israeli authorities are ultimately to blame,” Van Esveld said. “Senior state officials are fueling or failing to prevent these attacks, and Israel’s allies are not doing enough to stop that.”

Israeli Attacks Investigated

Al-Qanub

Settler attacks forced the residents of al-Qanub, 10 kilometers east of the town of Sa’ir, near Hebron in the southern West Bank, to flee on the evening of October 9. The community of about 40 people have been unable to return.

From October 7 to 9, ten to twelve settlers in civilian clothes, armed with handguns and assault rifles, piled up stones each day to block the only road to al-Qanub, which links it to the town of Sa’ir, said Salma, a 29-year-old resident who fled with her husband, Salim, and their seven children.

At 4:30 p.m. on October 9, dozens of armed settlers arrived. “Some went to [get] the sheep, and nine of them came to us,” Salim said. “They had guns and knives.” Settlers ordered them to leave within an hour or they would be killed, and one man said he would “cut our throats, and pointed at us, including our kids.”

Dozens of men, with dogs, stole and led the 200 sheep that Salim and his father owned toward a settlement outpost, Salim said. He and several neighbors ran toward them, but “that seemed to trigger [the settlers].” His father feared they would open fire and warned the residents to leave. The men, and women and children fled in different groups: “I told my wife to take the kids and run.”

Salma carried her 8-month-old boy and walked with her other children through rocky terrain for more than five hours in the dark, until 10 p.m., to reach her parents’ home, she said.

Salim, 35, his father, 75, and his children were all born in al-Qanub. “All our life was there,” he said. He is 18,000 shekels (about US$4,800) in debt for sheep fodder that settlers stole, he said. The family is living in a windowless, cinderblock storeroom in a nearby town, with no income to pay the rent.

Settlers from an outpost 400 meters away west of al-Qanub, began harassing residents five years ago, Salim said. It appears the settlers came from the outpost of Pnei Kedem North. Settlers prevented residents from grazing their sheep, and “cut the electricity, and three months ago they cut the water. They even took the pipes.” In December 2021, settlers set dogs on two brothers in al-Qanub and hit one brother with an all-terrain vehicle, and in February 2022, settlers attacked the brothers’ father, 76, fracturing two of his fingers and his skull, the rights group B’Tselem reported.

Wadi al-Seeq

Attacks involving armed settlers in civilian clothes and an Israel Defense Forces unit displaced all 30 families – about 180 people, including 90 children – from Wadi al-Seeq, northeast of Ramallah, on October 12, based on residents’ and human rights groups’ accounts, as well as Israeli news reports.

Beginning on October 7, settlers gathered daily at the entrance of the road that leads to the community. At 8 p.m. on October 11, a group of 8 to 10 men in military uniforms, armed with M16s and some wearing masks, arrived in two trucks, said 46-year-old Abu Hasan.

The uniformed men first entered the tents belonging to Abu Nayef and his sons, destroyed and stole the family’s belongings, then searched other people’s tents until around 3 a.m., Abu Hasan said.

Later that morning, a prominent local settler, armed and wearing civilian clothes, led a group of armed men wearing military uniforms without name tags who had arrived in civilian cars in blocking an access road, while a military vehicle and two police patrol vehicles were stationed nearby, four residents said.

Four vehicles with soldiers, some of whom residents recognized as settlers from prior attacks, then entered Wadi al-Seeq, residents said. The soldiers took residents’ phones, car keys, and IDs, hit people, and entered tents where women and children were taking cover, and threw belongings on the ground, said 30-year-old Marwan M.

The attackers said they would shoot residents if they did not leave within an hour. Abu Bashar said: “They said, you can’t take anything with you, and even the cars were forbidden.” About 30 people were wounded in the attack, according to news reports.

Soldiers entered Reem R.’s tent, shoved her and her children, and took their phones, she said. “One man in uniform kicked me in the back of my neck. They said, ‘Go to the valley, and if you come back, we will kill you.’” As she was fleeing, Reem saw her 20-year-old son, who has a congenital bone condition and a physical disability, lying on the ground, with a settler “stomping on his back,” she said. The women and children, including two with physical disabilities, fled to a cave, where they sheltered for eight hours without food or water, or their phones, until around 8 p.m., then walked toward the town of Taybeh, Reem said.

Meanwhile, soldiers forced Marwan M., Abu Hasan, and a third man, Nadim N., onto the ground, bound them, and hit, kicked, and beat them with their gun butts, they said. Another group of soldiers arrived and left, and a civilian vehicle arrived with men in military uniforms. Soldiers dragged the three men to a sheep pen, blindfolded and stripped them to their underwear, replaced the zip-tie on Abu Hasan’s wrists with painful metal wire, and for more than two hours, beat and kicked the men in the head and face. Nadim N. was burned with cigarettes. Marwan M. lost consciousness, he said. The attackers posted images of the men online.

“They took turns beating us, over and over, with threats like, ‘When you die your wife won’t be able to feed your children’,” Abu Hasan said. One man urinated on him, and another kicked him in the chest, stomach, and genitals. “I was screaming in pain. After that he brought a broom handle, jumped on my back, hit me with it and tried to shove it in my anus.”

Abu Hasan said the attackers stole three phones and 2,700 shekels (about US$700) in cash from the three men, and other belongings. In the evening, an Israeli military medic arrived with other soldiers. Marwan M. said, “they gave me glucose, and apologized. We told them how they stole our cars, phones, money, everything, and insisted that they get our things back, but they didn’t respond [to our requests].” He and Abu Hasan were hospitalized.

About five days later, Israeli authorities in two police cars escorted some residents back for two hours to retrieve their belongings, Reem R. said. Her household’s mattresses, blankets, clothes, electrical equipment, refrigerator, car trailer, 250 chickens, and 35,000 shekels (about US$9,400) worth of sheep fodder that was bought on credit, were missing, she said. Other residents’ documents, including birth and marriage certificates, were burned or missing, and two cars, water tanks, donkeys, chickens, and 13 sheep had been stolen, Abu Bashar said. Their homes had been destroyed.

Residents said they filed a complaint at the police station in the Binyamin settlement but have heard nothing since. The military asked two men to submit complaints.

The soldiers involved in the attack were part of the military’s Desert Frontier unit, which recruits residents of settlement outposts, including some settlers with criminal records, Haaretz reported. The military dismissed the commander in October in response to reports about the attack, and in December, dismissed five combat soldiers and froze the unit’s operations following additional violent incidents, Haaretz reported. Human Rights Watch is not aware of anyone having been prosecuted in relation to the events.

In December, the Israeli military filed an order barring the settler leader from most of the West Bank, for three months. He appealed the order. The US sanctioned him in March.

Reem R. and her family are sheltering in a tent on the outskirts of Taybeh. Her children were out of school for more than two months. The school in Wadi al-Seeq, which opened in 2017 and had over 100 students in grades 1 through 8, including children from neighboring communities, was destroyed after the attack.

The families were originally displaced during the 1948 war from what is now Israel. Between 2010 and 2023, the Israeli military issued demolition orders for 110 structures in the community, including the school, for lacking building permits, which are almost impossible for Palestinians to obtain.

Settlers began herding sheep on the community’s lands and harassing residents in February 2023. On August 3, settlers beat children and youth with sticks and tried to steal their sheep, residents said. The army arrested three men who prevented the theft and detained 35-year-old Karim K. on charges of assault and resisting arrest, which his uncle said were bogus. He was released in February on bail and a third-party guarantee.

Khirbet al-Ratheem

Between October 14 and 23, the entire community of about 50 people in Khirbet al-Ratheem, in the southern West Bank, was displaced due to attacks by armed men in military uniforms whom community residents recognized as settlers from previous attacks, accompanied by other soldiers whom residents did not recognize.

Settlers began to harass Khirbet al-Ratheem in 2021, destroying crops and raiding homes at night, former residents said.

On October 7, 2023, soldiers arrived and warned the community not to leave their homes or graze their sheep and blocked all the roads. On October 8, settlers attacked the home of 50-year-old Ghassan G., his 44-year-old wife Farah, and their three children under the age of 18; destroyed two water cisterns; and smashed their solar panels with stones.

At 10 p.m. on October 12, five masked, armed men in military uniforms forced three nearby households into Ghassan’s tent, dragging Ghassan’s elderly father, who had difficulty walking, and pointing an M16 at his head, Farah said. One man told them, “You have 24 hours to leave, [or] we will kill you and take your sheep,” Ghassan said. The attackers punctured their water tanks and cut their gas and water pipes. Ghassan called a humanitarian agency and the nearby municipality of al-Samu’a to help them evacuate but was told it was not possible to coordinate with the Israeli military, he said.

On the night of October 13, masked and armed soldiers, whom a family member identified by their voices as “settlers we’re used to,” entered the family home again, threatened them and demanded their phones. The family member, who hid her phone and video camera, showed Human Rights Watch videos of prior settler attacks.

As Ghassan’s extended family were leaving on October 14, settlers returned and forced them face-down on the ground, beating, kicking, and threatening to kill them, family members said. The family escaped to the town of al-Samu’a, 15 kilometers away, with 220 sheep, a few solar panels, appliances, and mattresses. A neighbor later filmed a settler bulldozing their home.

Ghassan had to build a sheep shelter on the outskirts of al-Samu’a, at a cost of 50,000 shekels (about US $13,400), and buy fodder. Previously, the sheep had grazed on 30 dunams (about 7 acres) of land.

The extended family of 76-year-old Abu A. and his wife, Lana, who have five children under the age of 18 along with adult children and their families, lived nearby. On October 8 or 9, men Abu A. recognized as settlers from an outpost of the Asa’el settlement entered their home and warned them to leave or “we’ll cut your throats.” His family found the slain body of one of their sheep next to their door, on October 11. At 11 p.m. on October 12 or 13, settlers smashed their solar panels, Abu A. said.

At 9 p.m. on October 16, five masked men, one wearing a military uniform and carrying an M16 assault rifle, arrived at Abu A.’s home, “shoved me on the ground, and the one in uniform kicked me in my stomach and hit me in the forehead with the butt of his gun.” The men punctured a water tank and warned them to leave by October 21 “or we will burn you.” Lana was hiding inside with her daughter in law and her daughters, including Anan, 8. Anan said she was very scared and “hid inside the closet and looked through the keyhole.”

Abu A.’s son, Iyad, said that on October 20, a group of uniformed Israeli forces detained him and three of his brothers. Some soldiers beat and stomped on them, and warned them to leave, as other soldiers “sat on the side,” Iyad said.

At noon on October 21, as the family was leaving with their belongings, three soldiers armed with M16s, blindfolded and zip-tied Iyad. Iyad said he was hit on the head with gun butts, taken to an outpost and then to two settlements, and finally to an army base in the Otniel settlement. He was released at 10 p.m. after Israeli police came to the settlement. A photograph taken on October 22 shows Iyad’s swollen hands and raw marks on his wrists, consistent with zip tie restraints.

Abu A., who has 11 siblings, said his family had owned 600 dunams (about 148 acres) of land in the area, where he was born in 1947. His family are now in al-Samu’a, but he could not graze his herd, forcing him to sell 100 of his sheep. He had previously sold his six cows after the Israeli military prevented him from accessing their grazing lands. “We are in debt, [and] we don’t have any income,” he said.

Three brothers from another branch of the family were forced to leave by soldiers whom residents recognized as settlers. One of the brothers, 43-year-old Ayman A., said that after October 7, settlers wearing military-uniform pants, driving a bulldozer and two cars, repeatedly threatened him, his wife and their seven children to leave “or we will burn you.”

On October 23, uniformed soldiers whom Ayman described as settlers, fired their M16s in the air and “threw us onto the ground.” He and his brothers, Mohammed and Amer, said settlers hit them and stomped on their backs. At around 9 p.m., the brothers and their families fled to al-Samu’a but had to leave behind their furniture and appliances.

Their wives and children are staying in a relative’s home in al-Samu’a, while the brothers and their older sons are staying close to a shelter they built for their 150 sheep. “It cost 8,000 shekels [US $2,100] for a bulldozer to clear the ground,” and thousands more in building materials, Ayman said. The sheep, cut off from grazing lands, need 125 kilograms of fodder each day.

Schools in the area switched to online education after October 7 due to the movement restrictions Israel imposed. Only 5 out of 23 schoolchildren in the extended family had devices or phones and were able to attend online classes, a family member said. Some schools reopened in mid-December.

Khirbet Zanuta

Human Rights Watch interviewed members of the extended S. and N. families who fled Khirbet Zanuta, in the southern West Bank, on November 1 due to settler attacks. The entire community of more than 140 people was displaced.

Saleh S., 38, and his wife and four children, ages 5 to 11, said their families had lived in Khirbet Zanuta “since our grandparents’ days.” Settlers established a nearby outpost three years ago and repeatedly harassed the community. After October 7, “they entered the house, cursing at us, harassing the children, swearing at them. It was every other day, if not in the morning, then at night,” Saleh said.

On October 7, settlers bulldozed and blocked the entrance to the road into Khirbet Zanuta from al-Dhahiriya, eight kilometers away, said Saleh’s sister, Abier, 45. In the following weeks, settlers regularly threw stones at their homes at night, hitting the metal roof. “For 10 days we weren’t able to sleep,” said Saleh’s brother Sami, 53, who lived nearby with his wife and three children, two of them under 18. Settlers smashed Saleh’s solar panels and windows and destroyed several residents’ cars.

On October 31, six armed settlers drove all-terrain vehicles to the home of Saleh’s brother Mahmoud, 42, his wife and three children, ages 2 to 9. They detained and beat him, Mahmoud said. Mahmoud said: “They were choking me, I thought they were going to kill me. They hit me with their M16s, all over, [on] my back, my arms. They cursed me and threatened my family, in Arabic and Hebrew. They threw me on the ground. There were cactus spines stuck in me.”

Saleh and Mahmoud said that they recognized the leader of the settlers who warned residents to leave their homes after October 7. This man had previously carried an M16 or a handgun and led settlers who cut water pipes, punctured water tanks, and used a drone to terrify the family’s sheep, Saleh and Mahmoud said. On November 1, the extended family fled. Sami said settlers armed with M16s “threw rocks at us even while we were leaving.” “We took the solar panels, the sheep, and our [kitchen] cutlery,” but had to leave everything else, said his sister, Abier. The family had to let their 100 pigeons go free. They rented three large trucks to help move their 300 sheep, at a cost of around 3,200 shekels (about US$860).

The family paid 60,000 shekels (US$16,000) to build a new sheep shelter, but without access to their lands, including four water cisterns, they cannot afford to keep the flock. The three brothers built rooms to live in, one per family, in a field near al-Dhahiriya. Saleh said, “I haven’t been able to sleep, I haven’t been able to eat. They forced a Nakba [catastrophe] on us.”

Munir and Sara N., both 38, and their nine children lived in another part of Khirbet Zanuta. At 7 a.m., a few days after October 7, settlers in two trucks, armed with assault rifles, accompanied by soldiers, beat six of Munir’s neighbors, threatening to shoot them. Settlers smashed the windows of a neighbor’s Mitsubishi truck and the windows of nearby houses.

Two days later, at 10 p.m., soldiers and settlers returned. One man threw a stun grenade inside the family home, where the children were sleeping, Sara said. Her daughter, Yara, 13, said, “The soldiers threw a sound bomb [stun grenade] close to us and I got very scared.” “The weapons terrify the younger kids, and we were afraid for their lives,” Munir said.

At midnight, several days later, eight or nine settlers arrived, accompanied by a military vehicle from which three soldiers descended. Settlers assaulted four families living nearby, beat Munir with the butts of their guns, and warned, “You have 24 hours to leave, or we’ll set fire to you.” The next day the family rented trucks at a cost of 2,100 shekels (about US$560) to move their livestock, which now shelter in an unfinished building.

After October 7, settlers also repeatedly flew drones over the family’s penned-in flock of 250 sheep, causing them to panic and trample one another, killing 10 sheep, Munir said.

“We’re all in debt,” Munir said. “If anyone would provide safety and protection for my children from settlers, we would go back [home].” On January 31, rights activists filmed settlers fencing off Khirbet Zanuta’s lands.

Sara’s children had gone to school in Khirbet Zanuta before October 7, but afterward, schools shifted to online learning, “and we don’t have internet devices.”

The school had 27 students from kindergarten to 6th grade, an education official said. It was burned in an apparent arson attack on November 20, and filmed on November 21 by a member of B’tselem, who posted photos and videos online. The school, built with humanitarian support from the EU, the UK, and other European countries, was later bulldozed.

The school’s kindergarten was subsidized and cost parents 150 shekels (about US $40) per year. Nadia, age 4, who had attended the kindergarten, said, “I saw it burned [on social media]. All of it. I got sad, and I started yelling. I used to play with doctor tools, kitchen tools, dolls, and Barbies.” Nadia’s family cannot afford the kindergarten where they are displaced, which costs 200 shekels (about US$53) per month.

School officials partnered with civil society groups to offer psycho-social support programs, a weekly health clinic, and purchased hearing aids for one student, the education official said. “The students lost so much with the loss of the school,” he said.

Ein al-Rashash

All eight families living in Ein al-Rashash fled on October 13 fearing further settler violence, and Bedouin families in the area were also displaced that week due to threats, according to residents and news reports.

The Israeli military has since 2010 issued demolition orders against 73 structures in Ein al-Rashash. Settlers began harassing the community in 2014 after establishing a herding outpost, called Angels of Peace, in a former military base, led by a settler whom residents identified by his first name.

On October 8, the same men appeared in uniform, carrying M16 assault rifles, and blocked the road to the community, said Wesam W., 25. On October 11 and 12, settlers killed six Palestinians in Qusra, about 10 kilometers north of Ein al-Rashash. Fearing a deadly attack, on October 13, the entire community “decided to leave, for our safety and dignity,” said Wesam’s brother Omar, 33. Omar, his wife, and six children, walked to the nearby town of Maghayir.

On October 27, two Israeli rights activists drove Omar back to Ein al-Rashash, hoping to recover some belongings. He found that 18 tents, a car trailer, appliances, solar panels, and sheep fodder that cost 150,000 shekels (about US$40,000) were missing, he said. Seven settlers wearing civilian clothes then arrived on foot and hit and kicked them, said Wesam and one of the activists.

Community members said the Israeli police in the Binyamin settlement would not allow them to file a complaint unless they did so in person, but they declined because police had previously detained and interrogated them about false complaints by settlers.

Armenia’s parliament adopted amendments strengthening the country’s domestic violence law. The legislation was adopted last week as postwar Armenia both struggles to secure its border with neighboring Azerbaijan and deepen its relations with the European Union.

Armenia’s 2017 domestic violence law was an important first step, but its accountability provisions were inadequate and protective measures were deeply flawed. The law’s title, which included “restoring family harmony,” set the tone.

The amendments remove the reference to “family harmony” and add additional acts of physical, sexual, psychological, and economic violence that can be considered domestic violence. These include, among others, forced medical and psychiatric interventions, hindering access to medical care, virginity testing, prohibiting or hindering contacts with relatives and friends, and various forms of exercising control over a partner. The amendments also criminalize stalking as a standalone crime.

Armenia’s criminal code doesn’t list domestic violence as a standalone offence, but it does specify that if the perpetrators of certain crimes are close relatives, this can be an aggravating factor. The amendments provide that partners and former partners (who are not deemed relatives) are now also included as perpetrators who can be charged with this aggravating factor. The amendments also specify that causing a child to witness domestic violence is tantamount to an act of violence.

The amendments set a minimum time period for urgent intervention measures – which are a step short of court-issued protective orders – and extend the time period for protective orders. Both measures allow police to force an abuser from the home or restrict them from communicating with a victim.

Finally, the amendments specify that survivors have priority access to free healthcare services to address conditions caused by domestic violence and that shelters must be accessible to people with disabilities.

Authorities noted a doubling in the number of criminal investigations into domestic violence: 1,848 investigations in 2023 compared with 960 in 2022. They partially attributed this to a new methodology of compiling statistics and an increased reporting rate, rather than an increase in violence.

Much needs to be done in Armenia to protect women and girls from domestic violence. For example, in some cases, courts invalidate police urgent intervention orders. And Armenia has yet to ratify the Council of Europe’s convention on preventing domestic violence, known as the Istanbul Convention. Meanwhile, the Armenian government should continue promoting zero tolerance on domestic violence and ensure accountability of perpetrators.",HIGH,20240418T180000Z,Survivors of domestic violence,"Taguhi, Armenian parliament, domestic violence survivors",Perpetrators of domestic violence,Armenia,"Promote zero tolerance towards domestic violence, ratify the Istanbul Convention, ensure accountability of perpetrators.",Inadequate protection and enforcement of domestic violence laws,Armenia,"Cultural attitudes towards domestic violence, inadequate legal protections"

The bombing and shelling of populated cities, towns, and villages produces horrific humanitarian consequences. In recent armed conflicts—in Gaza, Myanmar, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, Yemen, and elsewhere—this use of explosive weapons has killed and injured thousands of civilians and caused foreseeable long-term harm. In November 2022, 83 countries endorsed the Political Declaration on Strengthening the Protection of Civilians from the Humanitarian Consequences Arising from the Use of Explosive Weapons in Populated Areas (the Declaration). The Declaration sets standards for preventing and remediating the effects generated by the use of explosive weapons in populated areas.

There has been growing awareness and concern about the damage and destruction that armed conflict inflicts on cultural heritage. Such heritage ranges from ancient archaeological sites to modern exemplars of architecture, world-renowned monuments to regional museums, places of religious worship to centers for artistic performance. Cultural heritage passes from one generation to another and is of global and local significance. Harm to cultural heritage is, therefore, inseparable from harm to the civilian population.

This report examines the connections between the use of explosive weapons in populated areas and damage to and destruction of cultural heritage. It aims to increase awareness of the specific impacts of explosive weapons on cultural heritage and, by extension, civilians. It also offers recommendations for using the recently endorsed Declaration to better protect cultural heritage. While this report focuses on the Declaration as a tool to enhance safeguards within populated areas, cultural heritage should receive comparable protection from explosive weapons wherever it is found.

When used in populated areas, explosive weapons, such as aerial bombs, artillery and mortar projectiles, rockets, and missiles, kill and injure civilians and destroy civilian objects at the time of attack. These weapons also have long-term indirect, or “reverberating,” effects. They disrupt civilian infrastructure, which interferes with basic services, infringing on human rights to standard of living, health, and education, among others. In addition, they inflict psychological harm, displace communities, and cause damage to the environment and the subject of this report: cultural heritage.

Chapter I of this report provides an overview of the 2022 Declaration and the concept of cultural heritage. The Declaration is dedicated to protecting civilians from the effects of the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. It explicitly enumerates among its list of effects the “damage and destruction of … cultural heritage sites” and associated “civilian suffering.” While this report draws on the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, it adopts a more current definition of “cultural heritage,” which takes into account, for example, heritage of local significance as well as universal value. The effects of explosive weapons on cultural heritage warrant attention because cultural heritage protection can help communities recover, preserve intergenerational connections, and save sites of existential meaning to civilians.

Chapter II examines how the use of explosive weapons in populated areas endangers cultural heritage. It presents Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine as a case study. The chapter surveys five examples of attacks on and harm to cultural heritage in Ukraine, including to local museums and archives, cultural sites in urban centers, and places of worship. The case study highlights the frequency, diversity, and gravity of the effects of explosive weapons on cultural heritage and why these effects matter to the civilian population.

The war in Ukraine is just one of several ongoing armed conflicts where cultural heritage has been at grave risk, including from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. In March 2024, the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) reported that, since the hostilities between Israel and Palestinian armed groups following the Hamas-led attacks in Israel on October 7, 2023, the United Nations agency has verified 41 incidents of damage and destruction of cultural heritage in Gaza. The extensive use of explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas by Israeli forces is evidently the primary cause of this damage. For example, through analysis of satellite imagery, the research group Forensic Architecture found that airstrikes by Israeli forces destroyed the ancient port of Anthedon Harbour, which is on the Tentative List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Because the hostilities began after the bulk of research for this report had been conducted, this report does not include in-depth analysis of this cultural heritage damage, although some incidents are discussed in Chapter III.

Drawing on examples from recent armed conflicts in different parts of the world, Chapter III applies the Declaration’s framework of effects of the use of explosive weapons in populated areas to the cultural heritage context. The chapter describes the direct and indirect effects of explosive weapons on cultural heritage. It also shows how such damage and destruction aggravate civilian suffering by directly causing civilian casualties and indirectly inflicting psychosocial, economic, and other types of harm.

Chapter IV sets forth how states should interpret and implement the Declaration to enhance protections for cultural heritage. Specifically, it identifies five categories of actions that states should take in this area: preventive steps, data collection and sharing, remedial measures, an inclusive approach, and review and promotion of the Declaration. The chapter analyzes provisions of the Declaration that fall in each of these categories and offers recommendations for applying them in a way that maximizes cultural heritage protection.

Finally, Chapter V discusses how the Declaration can bolster current means for safeguarding cultural heritage from armed conflict. The Declaration commits endorsing states to strengthen compliance with and implementation of existing international humanitarian law, which encompasses treaties addressing cultural heritage. More important, it encourages them to go beyond existing law to protect civilians and civilian objects, including through the protection of cultural heritage. This chapter lays out four areas in which the Declaration, if interpreted and implemented as this report recommends, can strengthen and clarify current law to better prevent and remediate cultural heritage-related harm.

Recommendations

To address the harm to cultural heritage and associated harm to civilians, Human Rights Watch and the International Human Rights Clinic (IHRC) at Harvard Law School call on states to do more to safeguard cultural heritage from the use of explosive weapons.

In particular, states should:

Endorse, if they have not done so already, the 2022 Political Declaration on Strengthening the Protection of Civilians from the Humanitarian Consequences Arising from the Use of Explosive Weapons in Populated Areas; Interpret and implement the Declaration to enhance protections for cultural heritage; and Raise awareness of and condemn the foreseeable harm to cultural heritage and, by extension, civilians arising from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas.

I. Explosive Weapons and Cultural Heritage

This chapter introduces the humanitarian consequences stemming from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas and the Declaration that seeks to recognize and respond to this foreseeable and devastating pattern of civilian harm. It also offers a definition of cultural heritage and highlights the importance of its protection, even in the context of other harm to civilians and civilian objects.

Explosive Weapons in Populated Areas and the Political Declaration

In 2022, 83 countries endorsed the Political Declaration on Strengthening the Protection of Civilians from the Humanitarian Consequences Arising from the Use of Explosive Weapons in Populated Areas. As of February 2024, two more states—Jordan and North Macedonia—had joined them. While non-binding, the Declaration if comprehensively implemented has the potential to become a valuable humanitarian tool that provides protection for civilians beyond existing international humanitarian law.

When used in populated areas, explosive weapons, such as aerial bombs, artillery and mortar projectiles, rockets, and missiles, kill and injure civilians and destroy civilian structures at the time of attack. According to one monitoring group, in 2023, as in most years it has reported on since 2011, about 90 percent of the people who are killed or injured when explosive weapons are used in towns and cities are civilians. These weapons also have long-term indirect. or “reverberating,” effects. They damage civilian infrastructure, which in turn interferes with basic services such as health care and education, infringing on human rights. They also inflict psychological harm, displace communities, and cause damage to the environment and to the subject of this report—cultural heritage. The harm they cause is exacerbated when the weapons have wide area effects because they have a large blast or fragmentation radius, are inaccurate, or deliver multiple munitions at once.

The International Network on Explosive Weapons (INEW) was co-founded in 2011 by Human Rights Watch and other nongovernmental organizations to raise awareness of and urge states to address these foreseeable and well-documented humanitarian consequences. In October 2019, representatives of 130 states gathered in Austria for the Vienna Conference on Protecting Civilians in Urban Warfare. Ireland subsequently convened several rounds of consultations to develop a shared understanding of the problem and to produce commitments to address it. The final text of the Declaration was agreed upon in Geneva in June 2022 and formally adopted in Dublin on November 18, 2022.

The Declaration is the product of close collaboration among states; United Nations agencies, particularly the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA); international organizations, notably the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC); and civil society organizations coordinated by INEW.

The Declaration aims to advance the protection of civilians from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas.[7] Its preamble recognizes the practice’s “devastating impact on civilians and civilian objects.” The Declaration’s operative paragraphs enumerate commitments to reduce that impact, including through national policies and practices, data collection, victim assistance, and humanitarian access. The introduction, or “chapeau,” to the operative section articulates the document’s overarching purpose and notes that the Declaration commits states to “strengthening compliance with and improving the implementation of applicable international humanitarian law.” It also makes clear that the Declaration, while non-binding, goes beyond existing international law by committing endorsing states to taking additional steps to advance humanitarian ends. Elaborating on the goals expressed in the Declaration’s title, the chapeau specifically highlights “strengthening the protection of civilians” and “addressing the humanitarian consequences arising from armed conflict.” These commitments thus refer to the prevention and remediation of harm from explosive weapons in populated areas.

The links between explosive weapons and cultural heritage have not been explored in depth, but the connection is clear, and the evidence of harm is strong. The Declaration explicitly enumerates among its list of effects the “damage and destruction of … cultural heritage sites” and associated “civilian suffering.” That harm encompasses physical damage to cultural heritage sites as well as multiple reverberating effects on local communities and humanity as a whole. Consistent with the civilian protection goals of the Declaration and as discussed further in Chapter IV, it is therefore critical to interpret and implement the instrument in a way that improves protection for cultural heritage from the adverse effects of explosive weapons.

What is Cultural Heritage?

There are different legal definitions of “cultural heritage,” and experts in art history, archaeology, and other related fields have elaborated on the concept. The Declaration does not define what it refers to as “cultural heritage sites,” but states can look to these sources when interpreting and implementing the Declaration in a way that maximizes cultural heritage protection.

The 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict provides a definition of the related term “cultural property,” which is often used in the armed conflict context. Article 1 outlines the following three categories of cultural property:

(a) movable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people…;

(b) buildings whose main and effective purpose is to preserve or exhibit the movable cultural property defined in sub-paragraph (a)…;

(c) centers containing a large amount of cultural property as defined in sub-paragraphs (a)and (b), to be known as “centers containing monuments.”

The definition, which also gives examples of each category, encompasses a broad range of cultural property, including immovable structures (e.g., “monuments of architecture, art or history, whether religious or secular”); movable objects (e.g., paintings and other works of art, books, manuscripts, etc.); and buildings that house the latter (e.g., museums, archives, and libraries). The definition also establishes a threshold of significance for something to amount to cultural property by stipulating that it must be “of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people.”

The Hague Convention’s approach offers the benefits of breadth of coverage with specificity of examples, but it also has some limitations. It employs the term “cultural property,” rather than “cultural heritage,” while more recent international law favors the latter term. Cultural property “emphasize[s] the idea of property as something you own and the right to do what you want with it.” Cultural heritage, by contrast, focuses on human achievements that belong to groups collectively and can be passed from one generation to another.

Cultural heritage, unlike cultural property covered by the 1954 Hague Convention, can be tangible or intangible. The 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage defines intangible cultural heritage as “practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, skills—as well as the instruments, objects, artefacts and cultural spaces associated therewith—that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognize as part of their cultural heritage.”

The 1954 Hague Convention also judges value in relation to the world at large, by limiting the scope of its definition in Article 1 to cultural property that is of “great importance” to “every people.” Current scholarship, by contrast, tends to emphasize the significance of cultural heritage based on its meaning to local communities.

Experts interviewed by Human Rights Watch and IHRC reinforced and elaborated on the meaning of cultural heritage. Alice Sullivan, a Tufts University art history professor who specializes in Eastern European and Byzantine-Slavic culture, reiterated that cultural heritage should be understood to take a variety of forms. When speaking about Ukraine, she gave the examples of monumental architecture, city plans, religious icons, and textiles. She also mentioned other media, such books and documents.

Age is not an essential criterion for cultural heritage. Archaeologists and art historians provided examples that ranged from ancient sites to Soviet-era buildings. Capturing the temporal aspect of cultural heritage, Viktor Dvornikov, an architect and restorer from Kharkiv, Ukraine, noted that cultural heritage encompasses objects that not only reflect the history of a place but also “create an impact on the next generation.” Yemeni author Arwa Othman described cultural heritage as “[a]ll that is knowledge, all that humans create, and all that remains over time.”

Many of the experts emphasized that cultural heritage is closely linked to social identity. Olenka Pevny, an associate professor of Ukrainian Studies at the University of Cambridge, described cultural heritage as “any elements that are important to the identity-building process of individual groups and collective groups in a given country.” Her understanding reflects the growing concern for local perspectives of a site or object. Lamya Khalidi, an archaeologist and researcher with expertise in Yemen, told Human Rights Watch and IHRC: “Cultural heritage and populations are inextricably tied…. [O]ne cares about buildings because that’s what keeps people united and anchored and gives them identity.”

Communities need not be monolithic but can represent a variety of religions and ethnicities that culture helps to bring together. Othman said she associated cultural heritage with “open-minded[ness] toward others and the multiplicity found in cultures.”

While characterized primarily for its historic, artistic, scientific, religious, social, or other significance to a community or to humanity, cultural heritage can have more practical significance as well. Cultural heritage educates those who visit monuments or museums, archaeological sites or archives, about history, culture, and art, and can build bridges by increasing awareness of shared traditions. It can also generate economic benefits, including through tourism. Finally, cultural heritage plays a role in daily activities. People who live nearby may worship in landmark religious buildings, attend school in historic universities, or live in architecturally significant city centers.

The Declaration does not explicitly define the term cultural heritage, but it refers to “cultural heritage sites.” Its inclusion of the word “sites” implies that it generally focuses on tangible cultural heritage. Nevertheless, “sites” should be understood broadly to include not only museums, archives, libraries, and the like, but the movable cultural heritage they contain. It is also worth noting that the legal definition of intangible cultural heritage does include “instruments, objects, artefacts and cultural spaces,” all of which could be damaged by explosive weapons, and protecting that list of civilian objects can help protect other elements of intangible heritage. Because the Declaration uses the more current term cultural heritage rather that cultural property, it should be interpreted to protect heritage that is of local significance as well universal value. This report uses “cultural heritage” as a shorthand term to cover the concept discussed in our testimonial and desk research as well as the Declaration.

The Significance of Cultural Heritage

The significance of cultural heritage, globally and locally, makes its destruction in armed conflict a matter of serious concern. As noted above, the Declaration references damage and destruction of cultural heritage sites and the associated civilian suffering. While the use of explosive weapons in populated areas inflicts harm ranging from death and injury to psychological trauma to destruction of infrastructure, the devastating impacts on cultural heritage also warrant close attention. Protection of cultural heritage can help communities recover, preserve intergenerational connections, and save sites of existential meaning to civilians.

Because cultural heritage makes individuals part of a community, damaging it has psychosocial effects that can interfere with post-conflict recovery. Action on Armed Violence (AOAV), a nongovernmental organization that monitors explosive weapons use around the world, found that “[e]xplosive violence does more than just harm in a physical way—it has the ability to transform landscapes and cause deep cultural trauma.” According to a Syrian architect, people in Homs felt like “strangers in their own city” after it was heavily shelled: “They feel disorientated and have lost their sense of belonging, where they have lost not only the faces they used to see, but also the buildings, shops, and streets they used and visited.” According to the director of the Smithsonian Cultural Rescue Initiative, Corine Wegener, cultural heritage should be protected because people need it for recovery, resilience, and economic reasons. She recalled discussing the significance of loss of cultural heritage with a survivor of a major earthquake in Haiti, which she analogized to a conflict situation. While the man mourned the deaths of his fellow citizens, he told her: “The dead are dead, but without our heritage the rest of us can’t keep going.” Ukrainian studies professor Olenka Pevny described cultural heritage as a “lifeline … something to live for.” Destroying cultural heritage deprives people of the healing function of heritage.

Cultural heritage is passed from one generation to another, and its loss breaks that chain. Responding to the 1993 destruction of the Stari Most (“Old Bridge"") in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatian author Slavenka Drakulić wrote:

We expect people to die. We count on our own lives to end. The destruction of a monument to civilization is something else. The bridge, in all its beauty and grace, was built to outlive us; it was an attempt to grasp eternity. Because it was the product of both individual creativity and collective experience, it transcended our individual destiny. A dead woman is one of us—but the bridge is all of us, forever.

More recently, people in Ukraine and Yemen who documented cultural heritage destruction in their countries expressed similar sentiments. Volodymyr Yermolenko, president of PEN Ukraine, said, “Heritage is something that ensures a connection between the dead, the alive, and the not yet born.” It goes “beyond individuals’ lives” and, if preserved, allows them to connect to people of previous centuries. Karina Nguyen grew up in Kharkiv, Ukraine, which has suffered significant damage to its cultural heritage since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. Noting that cultural heritage cannot always be restored or rebuilt, she said, “[F]or future generations, [cultural heritage] is really important.” Arwa Othman, a Yemeni author and former minister of culture, said that “people are destroyed when their collective memory is destroyed.”

Finally, the protection of cultural heritage is critical because its loss is like death to an affected community. Responding to the destruction of the ancient Assyrian city of Nimrud by the Islamic State (ISIS), for example, Sheikh Khalid al-Jabbouri said, “Nimrud was like a part of our family. This heritage was part of our lives, part of all of Iraq.” When asked why people should care about cultural heritage destruction in armed conflict, Ukrainian architect and restorer Viktor Dvornikov responded, “When [cultural heritage] is ruined, you … lose a connection with a place and it is very hard to restore it.” He continued, “When it touches one place or one city, that is one case. But when it concerns a whole region, it causes a lot of problems.” Yermolenko of PEN Ukraine explained that cultural heritage is the “language of a community,” which enables it to survive and to speak across place and time. While some cultures are well known around the world, hundreds of others, including Ukraine’s, are not, so preservation of its heritage is essential to ensuring the community or country is not forgotten. “I truly believe this is very important,” Yermolenko said. “It’s a fight for existence.”

States should recognize that the protection of cultural heritage and the protection of civilians during armed conflict, including from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas, are both essential and not mutually exclusive.

II. Cultural Heritage at Risk: The Case of Ukraine

The use of explosive weapons in populated areas in contemporary armed conflicts endangers cultural heritage around the world. The ongoing war in Ukraine provides a compelling case study of this problem. Russian and Ukrainian forces have used explosive weapons extensively; the effects of Russian forces’ use on different types of cultural heritage in Ukraine is well documented; and culture is central to Ukrainian identity and to Russia’s stated war aims. The damage and destruction discussed below exemplify the frequency, diversity, and gravity of the effects of explosive weapons on cultural heritage and why these effects matter to the civilian population.

This chapter seeks to illuminate the risks that cultural heritage faces from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas in Ukraine. It documents five examples of attacks on and impacts to cultural heritage, examining the details of the damage or destruction and the significance of the loss. The study of specific Ukrainian museums, urban cultural centers, and places of worship is indicative of a larger humanitarian problem in this armed conflict and others across different times and places. A similar story is unfolding in Gaza; the extent of damage to its cultural heritage should be fully documented and analyzed as soon as conditions on the ground allow.

Context

Since Russia initiated a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, its war against Ukraine has had a disastrous impact on civilian life and inflicted significant harm on civilians and civilian property and infrastructure. Much of this harm has been caused by indiscriminate and disproportionate bombing and shelling of civilian areas by Russian forces, which have had widespread humanitarian consequences.

According to the UN, the vast majority of civilian casualties in the war have resulted from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. As of February 22, 2024, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) had recorded 30,457 civilian casualties, including 10,582 deaths, since the beginning of the war. OHCHR reports that out of that total, explosive weapons with wide area effects—such as “shelling from artillery, tanks and multiple launch rocket systems, cruise and ballistic missiles (air, sea and land-based), and air strikes, including loitering munitions and other unmanned aerial vehicles”—have caused at least 27,716 casualties, including 8,898 deaths. The UN has also stated that “the vast majority of casualties from explosive weapons took place in territory controlled by the Government of Ukraine and was therefore in most cases likely a result of attacks launched by Russian armed forces.”

The war has also had a significant impact on Ukraine’s cultural heritage. As of January 2024, Ukraine’s Ministry of Culture and Information Policy had documented almost 3,000 cases of damage to cultural heritage. PEN America and PEN Ukraine have written that Russia’s war effort has led to the damage or destruction of “hundreds of cultural buildings and objects, including museums, theaters, monuments, statues, places of worship, cemeteries, historical buildings, libraries, archives, … schools and universities[,] … local cultural centers (“houses of culture”), concert venues and stadiums, and other locations where people access culture in their communities.” As of mid-March 2024, UNESCO reported verifying damage to 346 cultural properties based on its preliminary assessments. Given the widespread impact of the use of explosive weapons in populated areas, it is likely responsible for a significant portion of the cultural heritage damage in such areas.

The destruction of cultural heritage from the use of explosive weapons has added significance in this armed conflict because culture is central to Russia’s justification for invading Ukraine, its denial of Ukraine’s statehood and sovereignty, and its apparent intent to erase Ukrainian identity. In an address on February 21, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin laid the groundwork for a full-scale invasion. In making his arguments, he noted, “I would like to emphasise again that Ukraine is not just a neighbouring country for us. It is an inalienable part of our own history, culture and spiritual space.” Responding to such statements, the director of the Maidan Museum, Ihor Poshyvailo, described the war as a “heritage war,” while Olesia Ostrovska-Liuta, the director of the National Art and Culture Museum Complex in Kyiv, explained that “culture is in the very core of the war.”

Cultural heritage destruction in Ukraine affects civilians at the time it happens and will have reverberating impacts as the country seeks to rebuild and affirm its identity. Because Russian authorities have called into question “Ukrainian identity and sovereignty,” Liesl Gerntholtz, inaugural director of the PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write Center at PEN America said, the “attacks on culture are experienced by Ukrainians more painfully than attacks on other civilian infrastructure.” Attacks that destroy cultural heritage “underscore[] what is lost and is not coming back” and “undermine[] [Ukrainian] resiliency and identity.”

Local Museums and Archives

From the very beginning of the conflict, cultural heritage in Ukraine has been at risk. The use of explosive weapons in populated areas of Ukraine destroyed multiple small but significant local museums, such as the Ivankiv Local History Museum and the National Literary and Memorial Museum of Hryhorii Skovoroda. Both contained works from individuals at the heart of Ukrainian artistic and literary identity. Both were left in ruins due to a combination of the weapons’ blast effects and ensuing fires.

Ivankiv Local History Museum

Fires resulting from the Russian shelling of Ivankiv, a town north of Kyiv, burned and destroyed the local history and art museum on the second and third day of Russia’s full-scale invasion. The Ivankiv Local History Museum housed art and artifacts of local and national heritage. In particular, it held the works of the well-known 20 -century Ukrainian folk artist Maria Prymachenko, who had been a resident of Ivankiv. The destruction of the museum and some of its collections demonstrates the vulnerability of movable cultural heritage to the use of explosive weapons in populated areas.

Truth Hounds, a Ukrainian nongovernmental organization that has been documenting war crimes and other laws of war violations during the armed conflict, interviewed Natalia Leonidivna Kharitonova, the deputy director of the Center for Children’s and Youth Creativity in Ivankiv and wife of Anatoliy Kharitonov, one of the museum’s security guards. She said that shelling began in the town on February 25, 2022. Before the arrival of Russian troops, museum staff had already started securing Maria Prymachenko’s works in a container on the museum’s grounds.

After the initial shelling ended, Kharitonova noticed that a munition had hit the roof of the museum. At that point, the museum remained largely intact, although the roof sustained some damage. More shelling occurred later, however, and a fire started, igniting quickly because of the strong wind. Despite initial reports to the contrary, thanks to rescue efforts led by Anatoliy Kharitonov, all 14 works by Prymachenko were saved. Natalia Kharitonova, who went to the museum after the attack, noted, however, that fire had burned exhibits detailing the district’s history, “pre-revolutionary materials, various certificates, towels by Hanna Veres (a famous folk weaver), paintings by Savchenko, Ignatiuk, Skopych, and works of the 19 century.” The fire was so intense that stone axes from the Medieval period cracked. Dmytro Koval, the legal director for Truth Hounds who has expertise in cultural heritage law, visited the site at a later date and reported finding that the museum still had no roof or inside walls. He told Human Rights Watch and IHRC, “It was completely destroyed” and only a “shell of the building is left.”

The Ivankiv Local History Museum, founded in 1981 and located in a former manor house, was best known for its collection of Prymachenko paintings. Prymachenko (1909-1997) was born a peasant and survived the Holodomor, the famine that Soviet leader Joseph Stalin imposed upon Soviet Ukraine. Working in a naïve style, she became one of Ukraine’s most beloved artists.

Although not all Ukrainians are aware of the Ivankiv Museum, Koval said, the Prymachenko paintings “speak to Ukrainian identity.” He explained: “Her style was really distinctive from other painters in the USSR or in Europe…. Her paintings are so important for reconstructing Ukrainian identity.” Volodymyr Yermolenko of PEN Ukraine described Prymachenko as “a real legendary figure.” He attributed her significance and popularity to her independence from academia and to her use of traditional and natural imagery. UNESCO declared that 2009 was the “year of Maria Prymachenko,” and she appeared on the country’s stamps in the 1970s. The artist has also been recognized internationally both in her lifetime and more recently.

Prymachenko’s importance to the people of Ivankiv is evident by their actions before and during the shelling. Efforts were taken to remove her paintings for safekeeping in advance of the arrival of the Russian army. In addition, local people risked their lives to save her paintings during the fire. Anatoliy Kharitonov, along with other men, removed bars over the windows, broke the glass, and climbed inside, passing out paintings to 10 other people. In this way, Prymachenko’s paintings and other exhibits were saved. Asked about the threat to the paintings and loss of the museum that housed them, Emily Channell-Justice, an anthropologist at the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute, said, “Anyone would say this destruction is unacceptable. It’s Ukrainian heritage.”

National Literary Memorial Museum of Hryhorii Skovoroda

Attacks on local museums continued as the war continued. On May 6, 2022, at 11:30 p.m., a Russian explosive weapon hit the roof of the National Literary and Memorial Museum of Hryhorii Skovoroda in Skovorodynivka in the Kharkivska region, sparking a fire. The fire, which was not fully extinguished until 8 a.m. the following day, caused significant damage to the site. The museum was important because it was the last home of Hryhorii Skovoroda, a major Ukrainian philosopher, theologian, poet, and academic from the 18 century and because it served as the repository of collections dedicated to him. This attack exemplifies the impact that explosive weapons can have on historic homes and archives, which contain information crucial to preserving intellectual identity.

Hanna Petrivna Yarmish, in an interview with Truth Hounds, described the scope and scale of the attack. She worked as a researcher at the museum on and off for 17 years. The night of the attack, she was awakened by the screams of her husband, who heard the explosion from their home, which is a 15-minute walk from the museum. As soon as curfew ended, around 6 a.m., she went to the museum and found the roof had entirely collapsed, with curtains hanging on trees, and glass and boards scattered. The museum was still burning, so she was not allowed in. Two cars belonging to the museum were also damaged. In addition, at least one of the security guards on the site was severely injured, suffering broken legs as a result of the attack.

The explosive weapon attack and resulting fire severely damaged the exhibition spaces and a memorial room to Hryhorii Skovoroda (1722-1794) in the 18 -century main building. Although many of the collections had been previously removed because staff had recognized they were vulnerable to the conflict, the incident destroyed almost all of the furnishings and interior decor as well as the museum in which to house and display the saved exhibits in the future. Architect and restorer Viktor Dvornikov who visited the site after the attack said that blast and fire also destroyed two other buildings on the grounds: a wooden storehouse and a nearby guest house where it is believed Skovoroda spent his last years. A charred statue of Skovoroda, left intact, has become a symbol of defiance in the face of what many Ukrainians perceive as a war on Ukrainian cultural identity.

Skovoroda was born into a Cossack family. His work explored questions around self-knowledge, identity, happiness, and the meaning of being. Through fable and allegory, he examined the ideas of rights and equality. His simple way of life inspired many. Volodymyr Lopatko, an assistant professor of civil engineering and architecture at Kharkiv National University of Civil Engineering and Architecture, said in an interview with PEN America and PEN Ukraine that Skovoroda “had a mystical and religious belief in the equality of people … and his idea that all unequal people should be equal became the basis of his religious and mystical idea of humanity.”

The use of explosive weapons in this case destroyed what Dvornikov referred to as a “significant historic object.” The heritage site was a place that people could go to learn about and remember a person who was crucial to the development of religion and philosophy in Ukraine. Ukrainian studies professor Pevny told Human Rights Watch and IHRC that the destruction of the Skovoroda museum “strikes at the intellectual core of Ukrainian identity.” Pevny described him as “Ukraine’s leading philosopher of the late 18 century” and as “a national figure, like George Washington or Abraham Lincoln” might be to Americans. PEN Ukraine’s Volodymyr Yermolenko said that Skovoroda was “one of the pillars of Ukrainian culture” who stressed “the importance of balance, equilibrium, and education.” Skovoroda's philosophy and way of life left a lasting impact on Ukraine's culture. Several Ukrainian universities now bear his name, and his image appears on the 500 hryvnia note.

Almost two years after the attack, money is still being raised for the museum’s restoration. A recent fundraising campaign initiated in fall 2023 by the museum’s team has sought to ward off further deterioration over the winter. The desire to rebuild the museum speaks to its importance to the local population.

Urban Cultural Heritage

Ukraine’s large cities experienced attacks on their cultural heritage in March 2022, the first full month of Russia’s full-scale invasion. Use of explosive weapons in urban centers inflicted serious damage to buildings of architectural and cultural significance in, for example, Kharkiv and Mariupol. Strikes in Mariupol not only destroyed its famed drama theater but also killed at least 15 of the several hundred civilians seeking refuge inside. As these examples illustrate, when explosive weapons are used in cities, they are more likely to damage or destroy a range of cultural heritage sites, deprive civilians of social space, and endanger civilians in the vicinity.

Kharkiv’s Freedom Square and Environs

The city of Kharkiv has been repeatedly subjected to attacks with explosive weapons since the beginning of the war. Many cultural heritage sites, including in Freedom Square and its environs, have been damaged by explosive weapons. Kharkiv is the second largest city in Ukraine, and its wartime experiences epitomize the risk of the use of explosive weapons to urban cultural heritage.

In Freedom Square itself, an office building called Derzhprom, or the State Industry Building, which is on the Tentative List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, suffered “some minor damage” from early shelling, and on January 2, 2024, an explosive weapon shattered clear and stained glass on its northwestern façade. Architect Viktor Dvornikov told a Ukrainian news source, Suspilne Kharkiv, after the most recent attack, “The scope of the [repair] work is very large-scale. Today’s damage affects the condition of the building, because temperature fluctuations can lead to damage to the interior decoration, which is a serious problem. There are a large number of wooden structures inside Derzhprom, (and temperature fluctuations) will be very harmful.” A 1928 constructivist skyscraper, the Derzhprom spans the avant-garde and art-deco eras. In the Soviet era, it gained international recognition and inspired modernism around the world.

Derzhprom is part of a larger culturally significant neighborhood that Dvornikov described as a monument of constructivism and “one united piece of cultural heritage.” The January 2 attack caused serious damage to a residential building located in that area and immediately behind Dzerzhprom. Dvornikov, who has observed the damage, reported finding significant cracks across four floors of the structure, which forced all the residents to evacuate.

Explosive weapons also damaged several architectural and historic landmarks near Freedom Square in March 2022 and at later points in the conflict. Due to an explosive weapons attack on March 2, 2022, the Palace of Labor suffered the “heaviest damage” to one such object in that area, according to Dvornikov, who saw the building later that year. “I haven’t seen any one place with such a high level of ruin…. Everywhere was totally damaged,” he said. He found fallen slabs of roof, five stories of collapsing walls, crumbling interior plaster walls and ceilings. Some of the exterior walls survived because they were made of sturdier masonry, but the interior wooden structure could not survive the detonation of explosive weapons. An apartment building constructed in the early 20 century, the Palace of Labor combined the art nouveau and neoclassical styles and has been described as an “architectur[al] and urban development monument of local significance.”

Five days after the attack on the Palace of Labor, Russian shelling broke windows and caused damage to the roof and walls of the Slovo Building, a well-known home for Soviet writers, poets, and artists in the 1920s. “Слово,” or “Slovo,” means “word” in Ukrainian, and the building, designed in the constructivist style, has the footprint of a Cyrillic letter “C.” Although the building was less severely damaged than the Palace of Labor, Olenka Pevny described it as having a “huge intellectual significance for Ukrainian culture” because of those who lived and created inside its walls.

Explosive weapons also damaged museums and libraries in Kharkiv. On March 2, 2022, for example, attacks with explosive weapons near the Kharkiv Art Museum broke its windows and damaged its facades, and in so doing, put at risk many of its 25,000 paintings. As Marina Filatova, head of the foreign art department at the museum, said: “The workers who stayed in the city are trying to remove everything, hide it, save it as much as possible.… It is impossible to keep the right temperature and humidity in the room because of the broken windows.” The museum houses “one of the oldest and most valuable art collections in Ukraine.” On March 13, 2022, the Kharkiv Korolenko State Scientific Library, the second largest library in Ukraine, suffered damage to the windows and facades of the main building as well as to the grand piano on its premises that had been played by the composer Sergei Rachmaninoff. This damage affected its climate control system endangering the preservation of book collections; an early estimate by Director Natalia Petrenko was that it would take nearly one million hryvnias (US$26,000) to restore the building.

Educational institutions were similarly affected. In March 2022, Russian shelling hit the V.N. Karazin Kharkiv National University, damaging many of its buildings. According to the university’s website, the history of the university is “part and parcel of the intellectual, cultural, and spiritual history of Ukraine.”

Dmytro Koval of Truth Hounds, who had visited Kharkiv prior to the armed conflict and was there again after the attacks in mid-2023, described the destruction in and around Freedom Square as “devastating.” “Before the war, it was a really magnificent part of the city,” he said. “Now it’s full of damaged buildings, and all the institutions that used to work in those buildings are closed…. It changes the landscape.” When asked if efforts had been made to rebuild, Koval explained that local people had covered windows with wood to try to prevent “further damage from rain, wind, and natural forces,” but “they are too destroyed to be rebuilding or reconstructing.” There are additional concerns about the stability of the remaining structures and the closeness to the front lines.

In addition to damaging Freedom Square’s architecture, the use of explosive weapons in populated areas has interfered with the square’s capacity to serve as a social center. Before the war, Koval said, the square, located in the heart of Kharkiv, functioned as a “space that gather[ed] the city together.” He continued: “Many people liked to walk around. There were cafés and museums. The city was beautiful. Such gatherings are no longer possible in this area. Architect and Kharkiv resident Viktor Dvornikov echoed this sentiment. The attacks on the area around Derzhprom, which is located on Freedom Square, caused “not only damage to a landmark, but also to a place that was very lively and social important for residents,” he said. Cultural heritage loss due to explosive weapons must be understood, at least in part, in terms of how it affects “how people experience culture.”

The reactions of the people of Kharkiv reflect the significance of the city’s cultural heritage to the local population. Karina Nguyen, a former Kharkiv resident, told Human Rights Watch and IHRC that she grew up having great pride in the architecture of the city and regularly attending the theater and ballet around Freedom Square. By the time the war started, she was living in the United States and working as a student researcher at the Human Rights Center at the University of California, Berkeley. Through open-source data, Nguyen has systematically documented damage to cultural sites in Ukraine, including Kharkiv, and published her analysis with Bloomberg. Highlighting the esteem with which the community held Kharkiv’s cultural heritage, she noted that some residents “put in a lot of effort to protect sites.” “They were using sandbags, for example, around statues…. They are risking their lives to protect culture.” When asked how she felt about the loss of heritage in her hometown, Nguyen expressed sorrow at the damage in Kharkiv and concern that important sites “will not be rebuilt in the way they were originally.” According to Nguyen, the damage in and around Freedom Square risks overshadowing the cultural identity of Kharkiv and those who live there in the eyes of the global community: “I don’t want my city to be remembered by our collective memory as the city of destruction. I want it to be remembered for its cultural artifacts and identity.”

Viktor Dvornikov, the Kharkiv-based architect and restorer, described his relationship with the cultural heritage damage in his city as complex. He explained that he has observed so much destruction in his city, “when you perceive ruins from a professional perspective, you can get used to destruction.” From a personal perspective, however, he has experienced loss. “What is most painful is when the environs [of historic buildings] are ruined. You go inside and see old furniture or an old staircase and understand that those are most probably being lost because they may not be reconstructed,” he said. “This all leads to us losing historical spirit and losing historical environment. It is almost impossible to reconstruct.”

Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theater, Mariupol

In March 2022, a Russian airstrike virtually destroyed the Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theater in Mariupol, a major cultural landmark of the port city. Hundreds of people were sheltering in the theater at the time of the attack. Human Rights Watch documented the deaths of at least 15 people in the strike. The Drama Theater’s destruction illustrates the serious risks that the use of explosive weapons in populated areas may pose to the civilians who shelter in or near heritage sites. It also represents the loss of a significant piece of cultural heritage.

Russian military and Russia-affiliated forces attacked Ukrainian armed forces defending Mariupol from the very first day of the Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine. As Human Rights Watch, SITU Research, and Truth Hounds detailed in a major report and multimedia feature, Russian forces laid siege to the city and, for eight weeks, hundreds of thousands of its inhabitants faced devastation and death. During this period and the months that followed, thousands of civilians in Mariupol died from airstrikes and the Russian siege of the city. During their offensive, Russian forces attacked much of Mariupol with explosive weapons with wide area effects, including heavy artillery, large mortar projectiles, multi-barrel rocket launchers, missiles, and air-dropped munitions. Attacks struck hospitals, schools, other critical infrastructure, cultural centers, and thousands of high-rise residential buildings containing tens of thousands of apartments.

A few days into Russia’s siege of Mariupol, the Drama Theater’s actors, designers, and administrators began taking refuge there. Given the theater’s large basement and thick walls, the city soon opened the entire building as a bomb shelter, and hundreds of Mariupol’s residents began sheltering there. By some accounts, 600 people showed up on the first day, and more continued to arrive. People who worked in the theater and knew it well welcomed and accommodated the new arrivals. A piano on the lower stage “drew crowds daily” as people sought comfort, familiarity, and safety in the theater-turned-shelter. A large hall above the entrance was made into a kindergarten. Some residents, sheltering inside or in other nearby buildings, would regularly come to the theater’s outdoor kitchen to cook and get water.

By around March 10, up to 1,500 people had sought refuge at the theater. They painted the Russian word “deti” (“children”) in large Cyrillic script on the ground in the plaza in front of the theater and in the park behind it to warn Russian forces that the compound held civilians, including children. The words were clearly visible in satellite imagery from March 14.

A Russian airstrike all but destroyed the theater on the morning of March 16. A man who lived about 300 meters from the theater said he saw a plane approaching the city center. The plane descended and dropped two bombs. He heard a loud explosion and, not long after, a neighbor told him the theater had been hit. The attack was most likely carried out by Russian aircraft that dropped two 500-kilogram bombs onto the theater’s roof, which penetrated the building and detonated in the main auditorium at about stage level, possibly with the aid of delayed-action fuzes. Human Rights Watch, Truth Hounds, and Amnesty International interviews documented that at least 15 people were killed during the attack. The New York Times reported claims that between 60 and 200 were killed. Because many people were able to leave the theater in convoys between March 14 and early on March 16, it appears that the several hundred people still present at the time of the attack were able to move to parts of the theater that were considered more secure. Human Rights Watch’s research found that Russia’s attack on the theater was unlawful, and those who ordered it and carried it out should be investigated for a war crime.

Before the attack, the Drama Theater had been Mariupol’s most famous building. People from all over Ukraine and beyond came to see plays at the theater, located in the heart of the city. The Drama Theater, an ornate building with a distinctive red roof, was constructed in the late 1950s and served as the city’s cultural center. Its arched entrance was topped by a stone carving of men and women carrying instruments, wheat, and tools, a celebration of the region’s culture. The building was once called the Russian Dramatic Theater, but local authorities removed “Russian” from the name in 2015 in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Crimea and parts of the Donetska and Luhanska regions. In July 2021, they ordered all performances to be conducted in Ukrainian. It was the city’s only professional theater.

The destruction of the Drama Theater serves as one of many examples of the devastation in Mariupol. Shelling of the city damaged or destroyed a range of cultural heritage sites, including museums, monuments, historic homes, many churches, and local cultural centers often referred to as “houses of culture.” Mariupol today would be barely recognizable to many of its former residents. Damaged multi-story buildings, together with countless personal items belonging to their inhabitants, have been demolished, while Russian occupying forces have begun the process of replacing them with new high-rise apartment buildings as part of Russia’s plans to reconstruct the city. Since the occupation began in April 2022, Russian forces have demolished or placed under construction most of what remained of the Drama Theater. The architect and restorer Viktor Dvornikov said that the loss of Mariupol amounts to lost history for the local community: “People might come back, but they can’t identify with this place. It’s a very big problem.” As a former resident of Mariupol who fled the city with her mother after their apartment was destroyed during Russia’s siege told Human Rights Watch: “As we drove out of the city, we saw it was all burned and black. We cried. Our city was gone.”

Places of Worship

Transfiguration Cathedral, Odesa

A Russian attack using an explosive weapon severely damaged Odesa’s Transfiguration Cathedral (also known as the Spaso-Preobrazhensky Cathedral) on July 23, 2023. Although the current cathedral is a rebuilt version of the original 19 -century structure, it is a site of spiritual and historical significance to the Ukrainian people and Odesa residents. The attack and its aftermath highlight the consequences of using explosive weapons on a place of worship for the site and the community.

The explosive weapon struck the cathedral by entering through the roof and leaving a gaping hole in one corner of the building. According to the cathedral’s chief priest, Myroslav Vdodovych, in an interview with the Guardian, the attack “was a direct hit, right in the altar area.” The blast also blew off other parts of the roof, exposing supporting beams and raining debris into the inside of the structure. An ensuing fire inflicted further damage, endangering wall paintings, icons, and other interior decorations. Members of a neighboring congregation assisted with clean-up efforts, donning hard hats and carrying out pieces of the cathedral and munition fragments.

Compared to some of the centuries-old churches and monasteries in Ukraine, Odesa’s Transfiguration Cathedral is relatively new, but its history has given it national importance. It originally dates to 1808 and was enlarged as the city grew. The cathedral came to have a central role in the life of Odesa. For example, it provided shelter to residents during the British bombing of Odesa in the Crimean War in 1854 and housed significant icons over the years. Nonetheless, the cathedral was destroyed in 1936, as part of the Soviet elimination of religious practice in the country, and replaced with a statue of Stalin. After Ukraine gained independence in 1991 with the fall of the Soviet Union, the community raised funds for a new cathedral, which was finally consecrated in 2010.

The style of the Transfiguration Cathedral is emblematic of Ukraine’s art historical traditions. When asked what characteristics make Ukrainian cultural heritage distinctive, Professor Alice Sullivan, who studies the intersections of Latin, Greek, and Slavic traditions, responded that Ukraine is located at a “crossroads.” She added: “There is much more cultural diversity than in many parts of Eastern Europe.” The cathedral exemplifies that mix. Classical, Byzantine, Ancient Rus, and Baroque architectural traditions are evident in the cathedral’s decorations, and one scholar writes that the iconostasis (wall of icons) “combine[s] the multi-temporal traditions of Christian art,” including Western European and Byzantine influences.

While some people have questioned if the latest iteration of the cathedral is too new to count as “cultural heritage,” as discussed in Chapter I, that term does not have a temporal element. Many have argued for the cathedral’s importance as a cultural landmark for the city and the nation. Sullivan told Human Rights Watch and IHRC that the fact it was rebuilt makes an even stronger case for its significance to the people of Odesa. “Renovations indicate to me as a historian that it was an important building,” she said. Olenka Pevny, the Cambridge professor of Ukrainian studies, said people associated the cathedral with the city and the skyline. The director-general of UNESCO, Audrey Azoulay, described the attack as “mark[ing] an escalation of violence against the cultural heritage of Ukraine.” In condemning the attack, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made a broader cultural appeal, arguing that the attack had targeted “humanity and the foundations of our entire European culture.”

The community’s reactions to Russia’s use of explosive weapons provide further evidence of its effects on civilians. Emily Channell-Justice of the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute described how local people helped the priests clean up debris at the Transfiguration Cathedral. “It was definitely the actions of ordinary people to protect and collectively respond,” she said. Pevny noted that local residents united to clear the rubble, a first step toward rebuilding: “People came from all over Odesa to try to salvage a building because they associate the city with this church.” The desire to protect cultural heritage led to “people coming together despite their differences for their own city and their own identity in the city of Odesa.”

III. Harm to Cultural Heritage and Civilians: Direct and Indirect Effects

The use of explosive weapons in populated areas creates a foreseeable pattern of harm. The humanitarian consequences of attacks on cultural heritage, including but not limited to the ones described above in Ukraine, fit into the framework laid out in the Declaration. Explosive weapons use has a “devastating impact” on civilian objects (in this case, cultural heritage) and on civilians themselves. Those impacts can be divided into direct and indirect, or reverberating, effects. The use of explosive weapons in populated areas can directly damage all or part of a cultural heritage site at the time of attack and leave a building and its contents at risk of further indirect damage in the future. It can directly kill or injure civilians living in, sheltering in, working at, or visiting a place of cultural heritage. The loss of cultural heritage due to explosive weapons reverberates globally and locally, causing psychosocial, economic, and other civilian harm.

This chapter breaks down these humanitarian consequences, providing examples of each from different armed conflicts in various parts of the world. It will foreground cases previously documented by Human Rights Watch and recent research on cultural heritage in Yemen done by Human Rights Watch and IHRC. It will also note other relevant examples. In presenting a framework of foreseeable harm, the chapter will detail how, in the words of the Declaration, “the damage and destruction of … cultural heritage sites further aggravates civilian suffering.”

Harm to Cultural Heritage

The use of explosive weapons in populated areas both directly and indirectly harms cultural heritage at the time of attack and in the aftermath.

Direct Effects of Explosive Weapons on Cultural Heritage

Explosive weapons’ blast, fragmentation, and secondary fires inflict direct effects on the full range of cultural heritage sites at the time of attack. The blast produced by detonations on or near cultural heritage can bend and break the structural elements of a building, even concrete and steel, leading to the collapse of part or all of an entire edifice. In December 2023, the use of explosive weapons by Israeli forces “largely destroyed” the Great Omari Mosque, Gaza’s oldest mosque, first constructed in the 7 century and rebuilt multiple times since. Images show the mosque’s courtyard full of rubble surrounded by crumbling walls. Explosive weapons use is particularly harmful to cultural heritage because sites are often old or made of more vulnerable materials, such as “unreinforced masonry,” clay, stone, or wood. For example, an analyst reported that because the buildings of Yemen’s Old City of Sanaa, constructed before the 11 century, “are made from clay, the bombing has affected them very heavily.” Furthermore, attempts to preemptively protect heritage can be very difficult, expensive, or unachievable. Even reinforcement frameworks may not withstand explosive weapons, actions to temporarily relocate portable cultural heritage are much more difficult during wartime, and efforts to protect cultural heritage can sometimes damage it.

Fragments of an explosive weapon and the debris dispersed by its detonation also directly affect cultural heritage. They can scar building facades and surface decorations and shatter stained glass windows. If they penetrate the windows of a place of worship, museum, or archives, they can damage interior walls or objects within, such as paintings, sculptures, tapestries, or books. Human Rights Watch field researchers documented an October 8, 2020 attack during the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh in which Azerbaijani forces attacked Ghazanchetsots Cathedral, an important 19 -century Armenian church in the town of Shusha (Shushi, in Armenian). The explosive weapons’ blast left two gaping holes in the cathedral’s roof and piles of debris on the floor. Fragmentation marks from the second weapon, likely with a time-delayed fuze, covered the interior walls. Fragmentation from explosive weapons that detonate outside of a building has the potential to extend the weapons’ effects beyond the immediate blast radius.

While explosive weapons are not incendiary weapons, they frequently start devastating fires. The presence of flammable materials, such as wood, paper, or fabric, can quickly spread flames. Wood structures or wood roofs of masonry buildings are especially threatened. The contents of archives and libraries place them at heightened risk. The destruction of Ukraine’s Ivankiv and Skovorda museums, discussed in Chapter II, provide ample evidence of the recent impact of explosive weapons-related fires, but those examples are not unique.

Indirect Effects of Explosive Weapons on Cultural Heritage

The physical threat to cultural heritage caused by the use of explosive weapons does not end at the time of attack. Structural damage caused by an initial attack can weaken walls or foundations and lead to complete collapse of a building at a later date. Ayman Al-Kinani of Mwatana for Human Rights, a Yemeni human rights organization, expressed concern that the centuries-old al Qahirah Castle in Taizz had been so damaged due to bombing in 2016 by the Saudi and United Arab Emirate (UAE)-led coalition that it could collapse in the future, not only destroying a cultural landmark but also endangering nearby homes. “Built on a big mountain on the side of Taizz city, if something happens, it could collapse on the city itself,” he said. According to a Mwatana report, the castle “is considered one of the most important spaces for the people of Taiz, especially after the establishment of a park in it which was considered an exquisite artistic masterpiece.”

Holes in the roof or walls or loss of windows leave cultural heritage sites open to exposure to the elements. This factor will speed decay of a building, its collections, and interior decorations. Speaking of fire damage in particular, the Northeast Document Conservation Center writes: “Buildings provide the ‘shell’ that safeguards collections, operations, and occupants from weather, pollution, vandalism, and numerous other environmental factors. A fire can destroy walls, ceilings, floors, roof assemblies, and structural support, thereby exposing contents to the elements.”

While it is well-known that damage to civilian infrastructure from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas interrupts health care, education, and other services, infrastructure damage also undermines cultural heritage protection. The loss of electricity or water, for example, can interfere with climate control or fire suppression systems essential to ensuring the preservation of fragile, often centuries-old cultural heritage, including structures as well as art, artifacts, and archives; it will also block continuation of pre-war conservation efforts. Security systems, which are important for preventing looting, may be shut down. Damage to internet infrastructure can lead to loss of digital databases of cultural heritage, such as collections of scanned manuscripts, that are not backed up. Explosive weapons may thus destroy both the original and digital versions of manuscripts, artworks, buildings, or monuments, making it harder to recover any losses.

Damage to nearby civilian infrastructure can also indirectly affect cultural heritage by unleashing damaging materials. In an article on cultural heritage protection in armed conflict, US Army Col. Andrew Scott DeJesse addressed the dangers posed by the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. He explained that during the US military’s 2003 invasion of Iraq, even missiles that “struck targets cleanly” damaged nearby water pipes, “flood[ing] adjacent buildings containing cultural heritage.”

These indirect effects on cultural heritage are exacerbated because the use of explosive weapons in populated areas hinders efforts to take remedial actions during armed conflict. Ongoing attacks make reinforcing or rebuilding damaged structures difficult or futile. In many cases, such measures are physically dangerous. Workers could be crushed by a collapsing building or exposed to incoming fire. Furthermore, ongoing explosive weapons use or damage to roads from past use can interfere with the delivery of construction materials and impinge on efforts to relocate movable heritage to safer locations. Olha Kryzhanivska, a regional library director in Kherson, Ukraine, reflected on the challenges of protecting the library collection from the weather after a November 2023 explosive weapon attack, shortly after repairing stained glass windows damaged from an earlier attack. She said: “On one hand, …. it makes no sense to repair, because there is shelling every day. On the other, something must be done with the roof, otherwise everything will be drenched. Still, repair is a risk to the workers’ lives, so it’s a difficult situation.”

Harm to Civilians

The direct and indirect effects of the use of explosive weapons in populated areas extend beyond damage to cultural heritage. Civilians are killed or injured at the time of attack and local communities suffer a range of psychosocial and practical consequences in the aftermath.

Direct Effects of Explosive Weapons on Civilians

When explosive weapons damage or destroy cultural heritage in populated areas, they can directly harm civilians as well as civilian objects. Explosive weapons endanger employees, including security guards, curators, librarians, artists, and others, who remain at the sites to continue work or specifically to protect the heritage. The attacks may also threaten civilians visiting or residing in homes or areas that are considered cultural heritage sites. An airstrike in the Old City of Sanaa by Saudi and UAE-led forces on September 18, 2015, for example, killed 13 civilians and injured 12, according to Human Rights Watch documentation. The Old City has not only been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to its 6,000 historic houses and 100 mosques, but also served as a home to families for generations.

Attacks on cultural centers—such as theaters, schools, places of worship, libraries, and museums—endanger community members who gather there for such activities as educating their youth, accessing their culture, distributing basic necessities and aid, and worshipping. For example, about 300 people gathered for religious lectures and night prayer at the Omar Ibn al-Khatab mosque, near al-Jinah, a Syrian village in the Aleppo governorate on March 16, 2017. US forces, claiming the gathering was an Al-Qaeda meeting, launched airstrikes against the site, killing at least 38 people and destroying the “service section” of the mosque, which contained rooms for religious classes and the imam’s apartment.

Other civilians suffer harm from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas because they are drawn to cultural heritage as a result of armed conflict. In some cases, people seek refuge in a site they believe to be safe due to its cultural status or to its structural elements; instead, they find themselves at risk. In October 2023, hundreds of Palestinians were sheltering in the 12 -century Greek Orthodox Church of St. Porphyrius, the oldest active church in Gaza, when Israeli forces launched an airstrike, which they said was targeting Hamas forces. “We left our homes and came to stay at the church because we thought we would be protected here,” Ramez al-Sury, who lost three children in the attack, told Amnesty International. According to Airwars, a nongovernmental organization that investigates civilian harm in conflict zones, the attack killed between 23 to 27 people and damaged multiple buildings within the church compound.

Civilians who go to cultural heritage sites during or immediately after attacks to rescue people or cultural objects, like the staff of the Ivankiv Museum, described in Chapter II, are equally vulnerable to harm. Those who document cultural heritage damage also fall victim to the use of explosive weapons. In October 2020, three journalists who went to cover the first strike on the Armenian Ghazanchetsots Cathedral were injured by the second strike. Yuri Kotenok told Human Rights Watch that he suffered fragments to his head, neck, abdomen, arms, and left foot and experienced lung damage and a concussion. Iona Craig, a representative of Yemen Data Project, a nongovernmental organization collecting data on the conduct of the war in Yemen, highlighted “double-tap strikes,” in which first responders and others arrive and then are injured by follow-up strikes, as a major problem during the war in Yemen.

Indirect Effects of Explosive Weapons on Civilians

Explosive weapons’ indirect effects of cultural heritage destruction on civilians are often tied to the loss of history. Reactions to the damage to Yemen’s cultural heritage during its recent armed conflict illuminates the harm caused at the global and local levels. Yemen’s heritage dates back tens of thousands of years. UNESCO includes four of Yemen's cultural sites on its World Heritage List, which recognizes sites for having “outstanding universal value”: the Old City of Sanaa, the old walled city of Shibam, the historic town of Zabid, and landmarks of the ancient kingdom of Saba, Marib. These sites were among scores that suffered damage during the recent war. In 2015, UNESCO’s then-Director General Irina Bokova stated, “This heritage bears the soul of the Yemeni people, it is a symbol of a millennial history of knowledge and it belongs to all humankind.” Ayman Al-Kinani of Mwatana said, “These sites reflect the cultural diversity of [Yemen] and the common human path.” Both speakers called for an end to the attacks on this cultural heritage because they recognized its significance to both the people of Yemen and the international community.

The cultural heritage destruction caused by the use of explosive weapons in populated areas further inflicts psychosocial harm on civilians because it undermines local communities’ identity. Scholars have described heritage as “a reservoir of memory that allows for the survival of collective identity,” and noted that its loss can “shatter the victim community’s very sense of who they are and where they came from.” As archaeologist and researcher Lamya Khalidi explained to Human Rights Watch and IHRC, the people of Yemen have lived for centuries, and often millennia, in some of their cultural sites, such as the old cities of Sanaa and Shibam. Damage from bombing and shelling, therefore, affects more than historically and architecturally significant buildings. Khalidi said, “If you destroy that [heritage], you destroy something very intrinsically important to the communities, to the populations, to their identity…. [W]hat’s happened [is] quite horrific.” Eman Homaid, chairperson of INSAF for Rights and Development, echoed that point when she noted that the city’s ancient buildings “have a very powerful meaning to the population.”

Heritage also may serve to bring unity to a diverse culture, a benefit that is threatened by the damage inflicted by explosive weapons. Exposure to different communities’ cultures increases appreciation and tolerance for diversity. At the same time, particularly when it is important to multiple communities, cultural heritage is a crucial tool for community cohesion. Stari Most, an Ottoman-era bridge built in 1566, had for centuries linked the Muslims and Croats of Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina. According to a Commission of Experts, appointed by the UN secretary-general at the request of the Security Council, the bridge “embodied the links which united these peoples in spite of their religious differences and the circumstances of the present war.” When Croat tanks intentionally destroyed the bridge on November 9, 1993, they physically and socially severed these communities. According to author Jadranka Petrovic, “Mostar became partitioned along ethnic lines, right across the front line, into Muslim east and Croat west, turning people into ‘us’ and ‘them’ and ‘ethnicizing’ everything that used to be the ‘shared’ past and the ‘shared’ pride.” People interviewed for this report also referred to cultural heritage in Yemen as a means for uniting the multicultural country and expressed concerns about the effects of its loss.

The cultural heritage-related reverberating effects of explosive weapons on civilians in some cases constitute practical rather than psychosocial harm. Bombing and shelling of cultural sites can have lasting economic consequences. A range of caretakers depend on cultural heritage for their livelihoods, and people visiting sites generate tourist income for the community. Cultural tourism accounts for 40 percent of all international tourism, according to the UN World Tourism Organization. In Taizz, Yemen, for example, al-Ashrafiya Mosque and Madrassa, which opened in 1382, as well as the more recent Salh Castle, which housed antiquities, Islamic artifacts, and traditional crafts, attracted large numbers of foreign tourists before the conflict. Local communities began specializing in a wide range of trades that provided incomes and improved their standard of living. Damage to the mosque due to artillery fire from the Houthis and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh in 2015 resulted in Taizz governorate losing considerable financial resources and in severe reduction of income for tourism staff, craftspeople, and local civil society. The same occurred after Saudi and UAE-led coalition airstrikes, presumably targeting Houthi forces, destroyed the Salh Castle and its museum in October 2015. “The castle was an important tourist destination, and with its destruction, the governorate of Taiz lost the financial resources it used to provide,” the governorate’s deputy director-general of tourism told Mwatana.

Beyond economic hardship, the destruction of cultural heritage due to the use of explosive weapons in populated areas can lead to displacement. In some cases, civilians flee in anticipation of conflict-related threats. In other cases, the use of explosive weapons on cultural heritage sites in populated areas leaves residents homeless. In the Old City of Sanaa, for example, cultural heritage heavily overlaps with residential areas. Damage to parts of the Old City, therefore, meant that some people were forcibly displaced. “The buildings have disappeared, and the people have disappeared,” said Yemeni author Arwa Othman, herself a former resident of Sanaa. The destruction of the Salh Castle, mosques, and madrassas in Taizz also damaged homes near the sites, displacing civilians living nearby.

The effects of explosive weapons on civilians just described have reverberating effects of their own. Preservation of cultural heritage requires experts or local residents with specialized knowledge but bombing and shelling kill, displace, or deny access to many qualified individuals. The mud brick and gypsum buildings of the Old City of Sanaa require caretakers who have unique conservation skills. Lamya Khalidi, who has expertise in Yemen’s cultural heritage, said that those buildings “were built in a certain way, using very specific architectural standards, using local materials and local technologies, and that know-how is passed from generation to generation because there has to be upkeep.” Even temporarily losing such caretakers and deferring maintenance can cause long-lasting harm to heritage.

Finally, by displacing or killing artists, destroying cultural heritage sites, and shutting down cultural centers, the use of explosive weapons deprives communities of an important tool for recovery. One scholar describes culture as a “powerful means to help victims recover from the psychological impact” of disasters. Liesl Gerntholtz, who co-authored the PEN America and PEN Ukraine report on cultural heritage destruction in Russia’s war against Ukraine, emphasized the importance of making it possible for artists to remain in the country or at least facilitating their safe return after a conflict. Doing so can not only preserve a country’s culture, but also help it rebuild and strive for peace. “[Artists] contribute to social cohesion and play a preventive role after war,” Gerntholtz said. “It is worth supporting [culture] during war. Elevating protecting culture is a way to promote resilience and a way to limit conflict in future.”

IV. Implementing the Declaration to Safeguard Cultural Heritage

In addition to offering a framework through which to understand the effects of the use of explosive weapons in populated areas on cultural heritage, the Declaration provides a tool for better protecting it. Given that the effects of explosive weapons on cultural heritage are listed among the “devastating impact[s] on civilians and civilian objects,” the Declaration’s commitments should be used to address them. States should interpret and implement the Declaration’s operative paragraphs to better safeguard cultural heritage as part of the Declaration’s overarching goal to maximize protection of civilians. In particular, states should take preventive steps, engage in data collection and sharing, adopt remedial measures, uphold the principle of inclusion, and review and promote the Declaration, tailoring each action to cultural heritage protection.

Preventive Measures

Policies and Practices (Paragraph 3.1)

States should ensure they address cultural heritage when adopting, strengthening, and operationalizing policies and practices under the Declaration. Paragraph 3.1 commits states to “implement, and where necessary, review, develop or improve national policy and practice with regard to the protection of civilians during armed conflict involving use of explosive weapons in populated areas.” This provision calls on states to establish a domestic framework for civilian protection, and thus should cover all the threats to civilians and civilian objects referenced in the Declaration’s preamble.

Paragraph 3.1 takes a broad approach to national implementation measures. It covers both policies (including statutes and regulations, military doctrine, rules of engagement, military handbooks, etc.) and practices (steps taken to operationalize these written standards). If relevant policies and practices exist, a state should implement or, where necessary, strengthen them. If they do not exist, the state should develop new ones. Regardless, the paragraph demands vigilance: a state should review and amend its policies and practices as needed to respond to emerging information or lessons learned. Because policies and practices are produced at the national level, the Declaration allows for flexibility across different states.

Action on this provision in the cultural heritage sphere can take different forms. States can incorporate cultural heritage into existing policies and practices dealing with civilian protection in armed conflict. Alternatively, they can adopt or adapt policies and practices related to cultural heritage protection to address the use of explosive weapons in populated areas in particular. Either way, states should ensure their policies and practices not only uphold existing international humanitarian law but also live up to the Declaration’s goals of reducing the humanitarian consequences of the use of explosive weapons in populated areas.

States should adopt a range of specific policies and practices to achieve the end of increasing cultural heritage protection. They would benefit in this process from consultations with cultural heritage and military experts. States could, for example, institute policies related to how explosive weapon attacks are approved and require a higher degree of military or civilian authorization before such weapons are used near a cultural heritage site. They could also appoint a monuments officer to accompany units in the field and advise on operations. Taking a step in this direction, in 2019 the Smithsonian Cultural Rescue Initiative reached an agreement with the US Army to train reserve officers to identify cultural heritage sites to help “avoid collateral damage of [those] sites from military operations.” To avoid attracting the use of explosive weapons, states should not locate their troops or arsenals in cultural heritage areas, something Mwatana alleged that parties to the conflict in Yemen were doing.

In some armed conflicts, there could be humanitarian benefits to the creation of a “no strike” list of cultural heritage sites, or targets that are too close to cultural heritage sites and should be avoided when using an explosive weapon with wide area effects. Some specialists interviewed, however, raised concerns that in wars where cultural heritage is intentionally targeted, such lists would be ignored or could even put sites at a greater risk. Referring to the no-strike list that UNESCO provided to the Saudi and UAE-led coalition during the war in Yemen, archaeologist and researcher Lamya Khalidi said, “Almost every single site that was on there with the coordinates was hit. This is something that everybody used to do to protect sites, but suddenly we have this example of exactly the opposite happening…. Since then, I have not been comfortable about giving coordinates of any site to anyone.”

While Paragraph 3.1 of the Declaration is directed at states, other actors, either independently or under government orders, could also develop policies and practices to better protect cultural heritage. Dmytro Koval of Truth Hounds, who has a background in the protection of cultural heritage, recommended, for example, that museums create guides for how to evacuate movable cultural heritage. In Ukraine, museums “have recommendations on fire and disaster … and just a tiny portion deals with evacuation of cultural heritage. It makes no sense because the actions are very different for natural disasters and for war.” Volodymyr Yermolenko, president of PEN Ukraine, said museums need protocols for evacuating and safely storing collections when conflicts are imminent. He also urged museums and other facilities to catalog or digitalize their holdings in advance.

Training (Paragraph 3.2)

Training is especially important in the cultural heritage sphere because the understanding of cultural heritage necessary for its protection is often lacking. Paragraph 3.2 of the Declaration commits states to “ensure comprehensive training of [their] armed forces on the application of International Humanitarian Law and on the policies and good practices to be applied during the conduct of hostilities.” States should understand training to encompass both the standards of protection and the subject—in this case cultural heritage—to be protected.

The Declaration’s training provision applies to both existing international humanitarian law and armed conflict-related policies and policies, including those related to the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. The breadth of training is consistent with the Declaration’s goals of not only improving compliance with existing international humanitarian law but also strengthening the protection of civilians from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. If properly trained on these topics, armed forces will have notice about their obligations and commitments and be more prepared to implement them in the course of their duties. When an armed conflict arises, well-trained troops should be more likely to uphold the law and to take steps to prevent the harm explosive weapons cause to civilians and civilian objects.

Paragraph 3.2 calls for training to be “comprehensive,” and therefore states should ensure it addresses all laws, policies, and practices relevant to the Declaration’s commitments, including those related to cultural heritage. Training should cover existing international law that deals with protection of cultural heritage in armed conflict, such as the 1954 Hague Convention, its Second Protocol, and Additional Protocols I and II to the 1949 Geneva Conventions. Training should also familiarize armed forces with the policies and practices regarding cultural heritage and explosive weapons that emerge under Paragraph 3.1 of the Declaration. A combination of classroom instruction and simulations will help militaries preempt threats to cultural heritage from explosive weapons in their planning and prepare troops to deal with scenarios in which they encounter cultural heritage in the field.

Armed forces should in addition learn about the cultural heritage of the region in which they are operating. Corine Wegener of the Smithsonian Cultural Rescue Initiative recommended that troops receive training in not only law and policy but also relevant art history before they deploy. Such instruction should go beyond existing cultural awareness training that they are given about how to interact with the local population. Better awareness of what constitutes cultural heritage and its vulnerability to the use of explosive weapons in populated areas can help prevent damage due to ill-informed targeting. Education about why cultural heritage matters can also create what the 1954 Hague Convention refers to as a “spirit of respect,” which can in turn encourage troops to protect heritage of either universal or local significance. In the process, training can help overcome what Patty Gerstenblith, an expert in cultural heritage law, described as the challenge of ensuring that cultural heritage is viewed as sufficiently more important than other civilian objects to warrant additional protection. Experts in art history, archaeology, religion, and other fields, as well as local community members, could supplement military knowledge of these topics.

Refraining from or Restricting Use (Paragraph 3.3)

The Declaration’s core provision on avoiding civilian harm is as applicable to the protection of cultural heritage as it is to the protection of civilians and civilian objects more generally. Paragraph 3.3 commits states to “[e]nsure that [their] armed forces adopt and implement a range of policies and practices to help avoid civilian harm, including by restricting or refraining as appropriate from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas, when their use may be expected to cause harm to civilians or civilian objects.” If implemented to maximize its humanitarian impact, this provision can help prevent damage to cultural heritage sites and the civilian suffering that ensues.

Given the overarching purpose of the Declaration, and the ordinary meaning of the terms “refrain from” and “restrict,” states should interpret Paragraph 3.3 as a vital tool to enhance civilian protection. Because “to refrain from” is stronger than “to restrict,” states should refrain from, or avoid, using explosive weapons in populated areas when their use leads to heightened risks to civilians. In particular, they should avoid using explosive weapons when the weapons have wide area effects and thus inherently meet Paragraph 3.3’s threshold of “expect[ing] to cause harm to civilians or civilian objects.” States should further agree that it is appropriate to “restrict” the use in populated areas of explosive weapons without wide area effects when “their use may be expected to cause harm to civilians or civilian objects.” The commitment would thus not prevent all use of explosive weapons in populated areas but would limit the practice if there was a foreseeable risk of harm to civilians or civilian objects, as is often the case.

As discussed in Chapter III, damage to cultural heritage causes harm to civilians and civilian objects of the sort that Paragraph 3.3 seeks to prevent. If the paragraph is interpreted as proposed above, it will significantly advance the protection of cultural heritage in cities, towns, and villages by committing states to refrain from using explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas. “One of the biggest problems is the blast radius of the explosives being used in residential areas,” said Iona Craig, representative of the Yemen Data Project. Furthermore, states should take into account expected cultural heritage-related harm when determining when to restrict the use of other explosive weapons in populated areas. Possible restrictions could include such policies and practices, mentioned earlier, as requiring senior-level authorization for specific attacks endangering cultural heritage or, in appropriate circumstances, imposing no-strike lists.

Foreseeability (Paragraph 3.4)

Military planning and operations should be informed by the full range of effects of cultural heritage destruction resulting from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. Paragraph 3.4 of the Declaration commits states to ensure their armed forces, “including in their policies and practices, take into account the direct and indirect effects on civilians and civilian objects which can reasonably be foreseen in the planning of military operations and the execution of attacks in populated areas, and conduct damage assessments, to the degree feasible, and identify lessons learned.” The fact that cultural heritage-related harm is as predictable as other immediate and long-term harm from explosive weapons triggers the application of this provision.

Paragraph 3.4 constitutes a broad commitment with regard to the problem it defines and the response it calls for. First, it covers “the direct and indirect effects on civilians and civilian objects.” The Declaration’s preamble lays out that such effects extend far beyond deaths and injuries to encompass various reverberating effects on people and objects. Second, states should understand and implement the commitment to “take into account” as extending beyond a mere consideration of these impacts and entailing concrete steps to enhance civilian protection, the central goal of the Declaration.

In the cultural heritage context, states should take steps designed to enhance protection for the sites and civilians threatened by the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. This commitment bolsters the argument for states to refrain, under Paragraph 3.3, from the use of explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas. In addition, the duty to account for foreseeable effects can inform when and how states should restrict the use of other explosive weapons in populated areas with cultural heritage. When asked how to avoid the inevitable damage to cultural heritage caused by explosive weapons in such densely populated areas as the Old City of Sanaa, Lamya Khalidi, the archeologist specializing in Yemen, responded simply, “Don’t hit them.”

Regardless of how a state interprets the commitment to restrict or refrain from explosive weapons use, states should account for indirect effects related to cultural heritage destruction when engaging in the proportionality test, which prohibits attacks that can be reasonably expected to cause “incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof” excessive in relation to the anticipated military advantage.

Role of Information

Data Collection and Sharing (Paragraphs 1.8, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3)

When fulfilling the Declaration’s multiple commitments on data collection and sharing, states should include information on cultural heritage destruction and associated harm to civilians. Paragraph 4.2 declares that endorsing states should “[c]ollect, share, and make publicly available disaggregated data on the direct and indirect effects on civilians and civilian objects of military operations involving the use of explosive weapons in populated areas, where feasible and appropriate.” Paragraph 4.3 adds that states should also “[f]acilitate the work of the United Nations, the ICRC and relevant civil society organisations collecting data on the impact on civilians of military operations involving the use of explosive weapons in populated areas, as appropriate.” Paragraphs 3.4 and 4.1 call for damage assessments and humanitarian impact assessments respectively. Data collection and sharing can advance protection for cultural heritage as it does for other areas of civilian protection.

The combination of collecting and sharing data serves the humanitarian ends of the Declaration.

The police arrested Atia Mohamad Abu Salem, 24, and a Jordanian friend on April 9, 2024, as they were on their way to film a demonstration in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza in Amman. He and a number of his family members, known for their opposition to President Bashar al-Assad’s rule in Syria, have been registered as asylum seekers with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), since 2013. Jordanian authorities later ordered Abu Salem’s deportation without a court order or realistic ability to challenge the order.

“Jordanian authorities are on the verge of deporting a 24-year-old Syrian student who has lived half his life in Jordan without charging him for a crime or presenting him before a judicial body and merely for attempting to document a rally in solidarity with Gaza,” said Adam Coogle, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. “Nobody should face deportation without due process, especially when their life and well-being are at stake.”

The unlawful deportation of Abu Salem, who is originally from Daraa governorate in southern Syria, would violate the customary international law principle of nonrefoulement, which forbids governments from returning people to places where they have a well-founded fear of persecution or other serious abuses.

While parts of Syria have not had active conflict hostilities since 2018, Syria remains unfit for safe and dignified refugee returns. Human Rights Watch has documented numerous instances where Syrian security agencies have arbitrarily detained, kidnapped, tortured, and killed refugees who returned to Syria from Jordan and Lebanon between 2017 and 2021. As recently as July 2023, Human Rights Watch found that returnees had been tortured in Syrian military intelligence custody and conscripted to serve in Syria’s military reserve force. Other human rights groups, the UN Commission of Inquiry (COI) on Syria, and UNHCR also maintain that Syria remains unsafe for returns. In March 2024, the COI declared that Syria is experience a “new wave of violence” not seen since 2020.

Human Rights Watch spoke to Ahmad Sawai, a lawyer with the freedoms committee at the Jordanian Bar Association who is representing Abu Salem; to Hadeel Abdel Aziz, the executive director of the legal aid group Justice Center for Legal Aid (JCLA), whose lawyers are also representing Abu Salem in administrative proceedings; and to a relative of Abu Salem abroad.

The lawyers said that Abu Salem has been held in administrative detention by order of Amman’s governor without charge and without being brought before a prosecutor or judge. The Jordanian Interior Ministry issued a deportation order against Abu Salem even though he has asylum seeker status. Lawyers with JCLA requested a copy of the order and appealed it in Jordan’s administrative court on April 15.

Abu Salem told his lawyer that during his interrogation at the Central Amman Police Directorate in the Abdali neighborhood, security officers coerced him into letting them search his phone, and repeatedly threatened to deport him. Abu Salem was then taken to the General Intelligence Directorate (GID), followed by the Shmeisani police station and back to the police directorate in Abdali, where he remains.

Abu Salem is a student at Yarmouk University’s Faculty of Mass Communications in the northern town of Irbid, nearing graduation and an independent filmmaker. He fled Syria with members of his family in April 2013 following the reported killing of his father by Syrian government forces in the city of al-Hirak in Daraa in August 2012. A relative abroad said that family members have long been vocal in opposition to President al-Assad’s rule and that one of Abu Salem’s brothers, who fled in 2018, is wanted by Syrian security forces for his activism. He said that Syrian officials have arrested or harassed various family members over the years and that security forces still inquire about those who have left.

“Atia’s pursuit of media studies alone could result in punishment in Syria,” the relative said. “And the very act for which it seems he is being deported carries the risk of severe persecution in Syria. On top of that, the family’s decision to flee Syria to begin with is viewed as incriminating in the eyes of the Syrian regime.”

If returned to Syria, Abu Salem would also be subject to military conscription, for which evaders can face arrest and detention.

“Atia loves Jordan, and our family is grateful they are there,” his relative said. “If he did something wrong, try him in court, but please don’t deport him to Syria.”

Lawyers told Human Rights Watch about another case in which a Syrian in Jordan is at risk of deportation in relation to the pro-Palestine protests and one involving a Jordanian-born Syrian national with a Jordanian mother whose deportation order was canceled after lawyers and activists intervened in his case.

Over recent years, Jordan has experienced a protracted shrinking of civic space, with the authorities increasingly persecuting citizens and residents engaged in peaceful organization and political dissent and using vague and abusive laws that criminalize speech, association, and assembly. Since October 2023, Jordanian authorities have arrested and harassed scores of Jordanians who participated in pro-Palestine protests across the country or engaged in online advocacy, bringing charges against some of them under a new, widely criticized cybercrimes law.

International donor governments should use their leverage to advocate against summary deportations and forced returns, which amount to a breach of nonrefoulement obligations, Human Rights Watch said.

“Jordan’s rush to unlawfully deport a Syrian media student for simply seeking to document a peaceful pro-Palestine protest is incredibly alarming and tramples upon both the right to free expression and the principle of nonrefoulement,” Coogle said.",HIGH,20240419T111500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Atia Mohamad Abu Salem, Adam Coogle, Ahmad Sawai, Hadeel Abdel Aziz",Jordanian authorities,"Amman, Jordan","Stop deportation of asylum seekers, uphold nonrefoulement obligations, ensure due process rights",Unlawful deportation of Atia Mohamad Abu Salem without due process,Jordan,"Political repression in Syria, Syrian regime's persecution of dissenters"

(Mexico City) – Trans people in the Mexican state of Guanajuato suffer economic, medical, and labor discrimination, as well as other onerous legal impediments, because the state has no process for issuing identity documents consistent with their gender, Human Rights Watch said in a documentary released today. Guanajuato’s authorities should urgently create an administrative procedure to allow trans people to reflect their self-declared gender identity on official documents.

The Keys to My Freedom, produced in collaboration with Amicus DH, is released on the heels of International Transgender Day of Visibility. It follows the stories of two transgender women, Ivanna Tovar and Kassandra Mendoza, who have fought to have their gender and names legally recognized in Guanajuato. Eight additional trans people from the state also share brief experiences of discrimination and messages of hope.

“The documentary powerfully shows how trans people in Guanajuato are disadvantaged in work and education and weighed down with legal proceedings due to authorities’ undue delay in recognizing their gender identity,” said Cristian González Cabrera, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The governor and state congress should urgently establish a legal gender recognition procedure that will contribute to reducing discrimination.”

Each of Mexico’s 32 states has the authority to determine its laws and policies in civil, family, and registration matters in accordance with the constitution. It is up to the state legislature or state governor to pass a law or issue an administrative decree that enables legal gender recognition through a simple administrative procedure at a state-level civil registry. Twenty-one Mexican states already have such a procedure. Guanajuato does not.

“It has been difficult to find a job,” says Kassandra Mendoza in the documentary regarding her lack of documents reflecting her gender identity. “[Employers] see my documents, then they see me and say, ‘This doesn’t add up.’ I’ve been made fun of, I’ve even been insulted.”

Ivanna Tovar says in the documentary: “Without a gender identity reform, we [trans people] cannot work in a dignified manner because we are violated, because we are not called by the [legal] names that appear in our documents, and [dealing with that] is the state’s responsibility.” She described gender recognition as her “keys to [her] freedom.”

In October 2021, a state lawmaker, Dessire Ángel Rocha, introduced a legal gender recognition bill, but the bill has not advanced in the current legislature. Previous gender recognition bills presented in February 2019, October 2019, and April 2021 also did not advance.



Until last month, the state congress was unwilling to consider bills relating to the rights of LGBT people. In February 2024, the state passed the Law for Persons of Sexual and Gender Diversity. It aims to establish coordination mechanisms between various authorities, as well as guiding principles, “to promote, protect and progressively guarantee” the rights of LGBT people. However, this reform did not address gender recognition for trans people.

Human Rights Watch and Amicus DH, together with the Trans Youth Network and Colmena 41, interviewed 31 trans people from Guanajuato state in April 2022 in the cities of León, Irapuato, and Guanajuato city, as well as remotely, to understand and document the harm related to a lack of legal gender recognition in the state. They found that the absence of a legal gender recognition procedure in Guanajuato leads to serious economic, legal, health, and other ramifications for trans people.

In states like Guanajuato without procedures for legal gender recognition, transgender people have to initiate an onerous legal proceeding to enjoin the state to recognize their gender identity on the basis of the Supreme Court rulings and international law. Federal judges generally grant the injunction, but it can be a lengthy and expensive process which requires hiring an experienced lawyer.

In a successful case, the judge orders the civil registry to permanently seal a trans person’s original birth certificate, meaning it is no longer readily accessible in its information systems, and to issue a corrected certificate. This new state birth certificate is necessary to request new nationally valid identification documents like a voter registration card, a tax number, or a passport.

In 2017, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights issued an advisory opinion saying that states must establish simple and efficient legal gender recognition procedures based on self-identification, without invasive and pathologizing requirements. The ruling is an authoritative interpretation of the American Convention on Human Rights, which Mexico has ratified.

In 2019, the Mexican Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling with clear guidelines on legal gender recognition. The court said that this must be an administrative process that “meets the standards of privacy, simplicity, expeditiousness, and adequate protection of gender identity” set by the Inter-American Court.

The Supreme Court ruling binds all lower federal courts. The court said that in order to comply with the constitution, state authorities should ensure that trans people can update their legal documents through an administrative process. In 2022, the court expanded the right to legal gender recognition to include adolescents and other children.

“The trans people who shared their stories in the documentary are just a few of the many trans people who are suffering under the state’s inaction on gender recognition,” González said. “Guanajuato should heed activists’ calls and Mexican law and join the majority of Mexican states that uphold the rights of their gender minorities by creating an administrative gender recognition procedure.”",HIGH,20240401T073000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Ivanna Tovar, Kassandra Mendoza, Cristian González Cabrera, Dessire Ángel Rocha",Guanajuato state authorities,"Guanajuato, Mexico",Urgent establishment of legal procedures for gender recognition in Guanajuato,Discrimination against transgender individuals due to lack of legal gender recognition procedures,Mexico,Lack of administrative procedures for legal gender recognition in Guanajuato

Iranian authorities’ decades-long systematic repression of Baha’is simply because they belong to a faith group amounts to the crime against humanity of persecution.

Government agencies arrest and imprison Baha’is arbitrarily, confiscate their property, restrict their school and job opportunities, and even deny them dignified burials.

UN member states should support national prosecutions under the principle of universal jurisdiction and renew the UN Fact-Finding Mission's mandate.

(Beirut) – Iranian authorities’ decades-long systematic repression of Baha’is amounts to the crime against humanity of persecution, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today.

The 49-page report, “‘The Boot on My Neck’: Iranian Authorities’ Crime of Persecution Against Baha’is in Iran,” documents Iranian authorities’ systematic violation of the fundamental rights of members of the Baha’i community through discriminatory laws and policies that target them. Human Rights Watch found that Baha’is face a spectrum of abuses. Government agencies arrest and imprison Baha’is arbitrarily, confiscate their property, restrict their education and employment opportunities, and even deny them dignified burial.

“Iranian authorities deprive Baha’is of their fundamental rights in every aspect of their lives, not due to their actions, but simply for belonging to a faith group,” said Michael Page, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. “It is critically important to increase international pressure on Iran to end this crime against humanity.”

The report draws on extensive documentation by Human Rights Watch and Iranian human rights groups regarding violations against Baha’is in Iran. Researchers reviewed government policies, court documents, and communications with Baha’is. Information was accessed through the Archive of the Persecution of Baha’is in Iran and documents from the Human Rights Activists News Agency. Human Rights Watch also conducted interviews with 14 Baha’is remotely in Persian, both within Iran and abroad place between May 2022 and March 2023.

Baha’is are the largest unrecognized religious minority in Iran. They have been the target of harsh, state-backed repression since their religion was established in the 19th century. After the 1979 revolution, Iranian authorities executed or forcibly disappeared hundreds of Baha’is, including their community leaders. Thousands more have lost their jobs and pensions or were forced to leave their homes or country.

Since 1979, the Islamic Republic of Iran has codified its repression of Baha’is into law and official government policy, vigorously enforced by security forces and judicial authorities. Judicial authorities interpret vague national security laws to label Baha’is an outlawed religious minority, branding them as a threat to national security. Human Rights Watch believes that this sustained systematic repression deliberately deprives Baha’is of their basic rights, constituting the crime against humanity of persecution.

The Rome Statute, the founding treaty of the International Criminal Court, defines persecution as the intentional and severe deprivation of fundamental rights contrary to international law by reason of “the identity of the group or collectivity,” including on national, religious, or ethnic grounds. Under international law, crimes against humanity are some of the most serious crimes “committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack.”

Court documents demonstrate authorities' characterization of the Baha’i faith as a “deviant cult” and its adherents as members of an “illegal group.” Official state policies outlined in documents reviewed by Human Rights Watch explicitly bar them from employment and education opportunities, deny them pensions, and seize their property.

Baha’is who spoke to Human Rights Watch described their persecution as a series of violations that begin with their first encounters with the Iranian state and affect every aspect of their lives, including education, employment, and marriage.

“[When I left Iran to continue my education], I did not intend to emigrate,” said Negar Sabet, 38-year-old daughter of Mahvash Sabet Shahriari, a prominent member of the Baha’i community currently imprisoned in Iran. She said:

But my experience at the university outside of the country was very different, as if for the first time a burden was lifted off my shoulders and the boot on my neck had disappeared … There [abroad] I experienced a strange freedom, and for the first time I was equal with other people, and no one was pulling themselves away from me.

Iranian authorities’ 1991 Iranian Supreme Revolutionary Cultural Council memorandum outlines state policies systematically discriminating against Baha’is, restricting their access to jobs, education, and economic opportunities. Iranian authorities also use legal provisions to deny Baha’is employment, pensions, and benefits, alongside targeting Baha’i-owned businesses, economically strangling the community by confiscating hundreds of members’ properties.

United Nations member states should support accountability measures, including investigation and prosecution at the national level under the principle of universal jurisdiction, and renew the UN Fact-Finding Mission's mandate, Human Rights Watch said. The UN Human Rights Council established the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Islamic Republic of Iran on November 24, 2022, to investigate alleged human rights violations related to the protests that began on September 16, 2022, after the death of a 22-year-old Iranian-Kurdish woman in the custody of the country’s abusive morality police especially with respect to women and children.

“The Iranian government's systematic oppression of Baha'is casts a shadow over every aspect of their lives and is a distressing testament to its discriminatory treatment of religious and ethnic minorities, leaving no aspect of their lives untouched by injustice,” Page said.",VERY HIGH,20240401T050000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Michael Page, Negar Sabet",Iranian authorities,Iran,"Increase international pressure on Iran, support national prosecutions, renew UN Fact-Finding Mission's mandate",Systematic repression of Baha’is amounting to crimes against humanity,Iran,Historical state-backed repression of Baha’is since establishment of their religion

NOTE: Andrew is off on holiday, and while he's gone we'll be featuring some of his colleagues' work. Today’s main story is authored by Andreas Harsono, Indonesia Researcher.

The Indonesian military apologized to “all Papuan people” and detained 13 soldiers from an elite battalion in West Java who had tortured a Papuan man in Gome, Central Papua.

A video posted to social media shows three soldiers in army undershirts brutally beating Definus Kogoya, a young Papuan man, who had his hands tied behind him and been placed inside a drum filled with water. The soldiers taunted Kogoya with racist slurs, kicking and hitting him. In another video, a man used a bayonet to cut his back. The water turned red.

The army spokesman, Brig. Gen. Kristomei Sianturi, said the soldiers had “tarnished efforts to handle conflict” in Central Papua, adding that the military police had questioned 42 soldiers of the 300 Infantry Raider Battalion, and identified at least 13 suspects.

General Sianturi alleged that Kogoya was a member of the West Papua National Liberation Army and had been arrested on February 3 with two other Papuan men, Alianus Murib and Warinus Kogoya, after they had allegedly tried to burn down a medical clinic in Gome. He said Warinus Kogoya died when he jumped from a military vehicle after arrest.

Kogoya and Murib were handed over to police custody by the battalion on February 6. The police immediately released the two men as they had found no evidence of arson or other violent acts. Both men needed medical treatment.

On March 21, Benny Wenda, a West Papua leader in exile in the United Kingdom, posted the video, saying, “Torture is such a widespread military practice that it has been described as a ‘mode of governance’ in West Papua.”

Human Rights Watch has documented numerous accounts of torture from West Papua over the past two decades including some that were filmed and later made public. Several soldiers have been prosecuted but received light punishment.

Some Indonesian officials have blamed Papuan militants when confronted with torture allegations.

While there is an ongoing armed conflict in Central Papua – in May 2023, an Indonesian soldier was fatally shot – international law forbids torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of civilians or captured combatants in custody.

To end such abuses, Indonesian authorities should prosecute the alleged perpetrators in civilian courts.

Your Majesties,

We, the undersigned, call your immediate attention to the deteriorating health of award-winning academic, blogger, and human rights defender Dr. Abduljalil al-Singace, who marks 1,000 days on a liquids-only hunger strike on April 3, 2024. We urge you to take action to immediately release al-Singace, who is wrongfully detained, and ensure that he receives the healthcare he urgently needs.

Al-Singace began his hunger strike on July 8, 2021, in response to prison authorities’ confiscation of his manuscript on Bahraini dialects of Arabic that he spent four years researching and writing. During his hunger strike, he has been sustaining himself only on multivitamin liquid supplements, tea with milk and sugar, water, and salts.

Al-Singace, who has a disability, has been wrongfully detained since his arrest in 2011 solely for exercising his human rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. He has reportedly been subject to torture during his time in detention.[1]

Since July 2021, according to UN experts, “Mr. al-Singace has been held in a state of isolation likely amounting to solitary confinement” within his room at Kanoo Medical Centre, where he has said that he has been prohibited from going outside, having exposure to direct sunlight, and receiving the adequate physiotherapy required for his disability. According to his family, he has also been deprived of necessary examinations and medical information, including results from MRI scans of his shoulder and head from October 2021. He has been denied treatment for several medical issues, including inflamed joints, impaired vision, enlarged prostate, and tremors.

Authorities continue to deny him medical items that doctors requested, including slippers to prevent slipping in the bathroom and a hot water bottle to relieve pain in his joints. Authorities have also limited his access to information by banning English and Arabic newspapers and restricting accessible TV channels. On January 21, 2024, al-Singace’s family told the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy that they were subjected to harsh measures during visitations, which al-Singace believes constituted a deliberate attempt to pressure him into declining visitations altogether.

On April 17, 2023, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Gerard Quinn said that “as a human rights defender with a disability in detention, al-Singace faces additional risks. He should be given frequent medical check-ups, afforded reasonable accommodation for his disability, with assistive technologies and other specialized care and considerations. But the Bahraini authorities have not always allowed him this.”

We echo the “concern at the continuation of the violations perpetrated against al-Singace” raised by a group of three UN special rapporteurs in September 2023, who also noted their previous communications regarding al-Singace’s case, sent on December 30, 2021 and November 15, 2021.

We follow up on our July 11, 2023 call for your intervention and urge you to release al-Singace immediately and unconditionally. In the meantime, we urge you to ensure that he is held in conditions that meet international standards, receives his medication without delay, has access to adequate healthcare in compliance with medical ethics, and that his arbitrarily confiscated research is immediately transferred to his family members.

Georgia’s ruling party plans to reintroduce highly controversial Russia-style “foreign agent” legislation aimed at incapacitating civil society and independent media.

If adopted, the laws, which were withdrawn last year in the face of massive protests, would require foreign-funded nongovernmental organizations and media to register as “agents of foreign influence”. That would make them subject to additional scrutiny and sanctions, including administrative penalties up to 25,000 GEL (about 8,600 Euro). Authorities claim the laws promote “transparency”, but their statements make it clear the laws will be used to stigmatize and punish critical voices.

Georgia was granted EU candidate status in December 2023 on the understanding it would improve conditions for civil society. This move risks derailing its EU integration even if the EU has until now been willing to move the country forward in the accession process despite limited progress on EU reform priorities.

Georgia’s defiance of the EU on its civil society commitments isn’t so surprising when seen in the regional context.

The day before Georgia’s announcement, Kyrgyzstan’s president signed an abusive “foreign representatives” law. Copied almost entirely from the Russian equivalent, the law would apply the stigmatizing designation of “foreign representative” to any nongovernmental organization that receives foreign funding and engages in vaguely defined “political activity”. The bill had been widely criticized after its initial submission in November 2022, including in a urgency resolution by the European Parliament.

The EU had ample opportunity to press the authorities to reject this bill. Kyrgyzstan benefits from privileged access to the EU internal market tied to respect for international human rights conventions: conventions this law clearly contravenes. The country is poised to sign an enhanced partnership agreement with the EU that centers democracy and fundamental rights. The EU has been silent on whether these deals would be imperiled by the bill’s adoption, despite the fact the European Commission’s own assessment highlighted Kyrgyzstan’s dire environment for civil society and the country’s breach of its obligations.

The latest spate of curbs on civil society comes in the wake of the European Commission’s December 2023 legislative proposal for an EU Directive on “transparency of interest representation” that would create a register of organizations which receive foreign funding. European civil society vehemently opposes the proposal because it risks shrinking space for independent organizations at home and diminishing the EU’s credibility in opposing such laws abroad. Yet the Commission forged ahead. On the same day the proposal was adopted, Hungary’s parliament approved a law that gives a government-controlled body broad powers to target civil society and independent media.

Israeli forces unlawfully attacked a residential building in Gaza on October 31, 2023, absent any apparent military target, killing at least 106 civilians, including 54 children.

Scores of Israeli airstrikes in Gaza since October 7 have caused thousands of civilian casualties, underscoring the greater risk of unlawful attacks from explosive weapons in populated areas.

Governments should suspend arms transfers to Israel, support the International Criminal Court investigation in Palestine, and impose targeted sanctions on officials responsible for laws-of-war violations.

(Jerusalem, April 4, 2024) – An Israeli airstrike on a six-story apartment building sheltering hundreds of people in central Gaza on October 31, 2023, is an apparent war crime, Human Rights Watch said today. The attack, which killed at least 106 civilians, including 54 children, is among the deadliest single incidents for civilians since the Israeli government’s bombardment and ground incursion into Gaza following the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on October 7.

Human Rights Watch found no evidence of a military target in the vicinity of the building at the time of the Israeli attack, making the strike unlawfully indiscriminate under the laws of war. Israeli authorities have provided no justification for the attack. The Israeli military’s long track record of failing to credibly investigate alleged war crimes underscores the importance of the International Criminal Court (ICC)’s inquiry into serious crimes committed by all parties to the conflict.

“Israel’s unlawful airstrike on an apartment building on October 31 killed at least 106 people, including children playing football, residents charging phones in the ground-floor grocery store, and displaced families seeking safety,” said Gerry Simpson, associate crisis and conflict director at Human Rights Watch. “This strike inflicted massive civilian casualties without an apparent military target – one of scores of attacks causing overwhelming carnage, and highlighting the urgency of the ICC probe.”

Between January and March 2024, Human Rights Watch spoke by phone with 16 people about the October 31 attack on the residential Engineers’ Building, and the death of their relatives and others. Human Rights Watch analyzed satellite imagery, 35 photographs, and 45 videos of the attack’s aftermath, as well as other relevant photographs and videos on social media. Human Rights Watch was unable to visit the site because Israeli authorities have blocked virtually all entry into Gaza at its crossings since October 7. Israel has repeatedly denied Human Rights Watch requests to enter Gaza over the last 16 years.

Witnesses said that on October 31, 350 or more people were staying at the Engineers’ Building, just south of the Nuseirat refugee camp. At least 150 were seeking shelter after fleeing their homes elsewhere in Gaza.

Without warning, at about 2:30 p.m., four aerial munitions struck the building within about 10 seconds. The building was completely demolished.

Two brothers said that they rushed out of their nearby homes to look for their two children and their nephew, whom they knew were outside playing football. One of the men said he found his 11-year-old son lying under concrete bars in the rubble: “The back of his head was cracked open, one of his legs seemed barely connected to his body and part of his face was burned, but he seemed to be alive. We freed him in seconds, but he died in the ambulance. We buried him the same day.” All three boys died in the attack.

None of the witnesses interviewed said they had received or heard about any warning from Israeli authorities to evacuate the building before the strike.

Human Rights Watch confirmed the identities of 106 people killed through interviews with relatives of some of the victims, including 34 women, 18 men, and 54 children. The total number of dead is most likely higher. Airwars, a nongovernmental organization that investigates civilian harm in conflict zones, identified in open-source materials 112 names of people killed, including 96 identified by both organizations, as well as 19 other people not by name but through their relationship to other victims in their family.

Human Rights Watch interviewed two people involved in the recovery of bodies from the rubble of the building, who said that on the afternoon of the attack they worked together with others and helped recover about 60 bodies, and that over the next four days, they together recovered about 80 more bodies. A third person said that he helped recover bodies from the rubble for 12 days after the attack. It is possible that other bodies remain under the rubble.

The Israeli authorities have not publicly provided any information about the attack, including the intended target and any precautions to minimize harm to civilians. They have also not responded to a March 13 Human Rights Watch letter summarizing the findings and requesting specific information.

The laws of war prohibit attacks that target civilians and civilian objects, that do not discriminate between civilians and combatants, or that are expected to cause harm to civilians or civilian objects that is disproportionate to any anticipated military advantage. Indiscriminate attacks include attacks that are not directed at a specific military target or use a method or means of combat whose effects cannot be limited as required. Warring parties must take all feasible precautions to minimize harm to civilians, including by providing effective advance warnings of attacks unless circumstances do not permit, and by sparing civilians under their control from the effects of attacks. Serious violations of the laws of war committed by individuals with criminal intent – that is, deliberately or recklessly – are war crimes.

The absence of a military objective would render the attack on the Engineers’ Building unlawfully deliberate or indiscriminate, Human Rights Watch said. The fact that the building was hit four times strongly suggests that the munitions were intended to hit the building and that the strike was not the result of a malfunction or misdirection. Even the presence of a valid military target would raise issues about the attack being disproportionate, given the visible and expected presence of large numbers of civilians in and around the building.

The strike is one of hundreds of attacks that the Israeli military has carried out in Gaza that have killed or injured Palestinian civilians since the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on October 7 that resulted in the killing of more than 1,100 people and resulted in about 240 others taken hostage. Airwars has credibly reported that 195 likely attacks by the Israeli military killed from 1 to 9 civilians, 107 attacks killed between 10 and 59, and 4 killed between 60 and 139. As of April 1, Airwars had also collected preliminary information about civilian casualties in another 3,358 attacks most likely involving Israeli airstrikes.

These attacks underscore the devastating harm to civilians and the increased likelihood of unlawful attacks when explosive weapons with wide-area effects are used in densely populated areas. All governments should support the November 2022 Political Declaration that seeks to curb the use of such weapons in populated cities and towns.

The Gaza Health Ministry has reported that from October 7 to March 31, more than 32,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including more than 13,000 children and 9,000 women, and 75,000 injured. This includes the killing of at least 2,400 people in March alone. The statistics do not distinguish between combatants and civilians.

Haaretz newspaper reported in February that the Israeli military was investigating “dozens of cases” in which its forces may have violated the laws of war. It is not clear whether the attack on the Engineers’ Building on October 31 is one of those cases.

Israel’s allies should suspend military assistance and arms sales to Israel so long as its forces commit systematic and widespread laws-of-war violations against Palestinian civilians with impunity. Governments that continue to provide arms to the Israeli government risk complicity in war crimes. They should also use their leverage, including through targeted sanctions, to press Israeli authorities to cease committing grave abuses.

“The staggering number of Palestinian deaths, mostly women and children, shows deadly disregard for civilian life and points to many more possible war crimes that need to be investigated,” Simpson said. “Other governments should press the Israeli government to end unlawful attacks, and immediately halt arms transfers to Israel to save civilian lives and avoid complicity in war crimes.”

Hostilities between Israel and Palestinian Armed Groups

On the morning of October 7, 2023, Hamas-led fighters breached the fences separating Israel and Gaza, and entered southern Israel. They attacked at least 19 kibbutzim, 3 moshavim (collective communities), 2 cities, a music festival, and a beach party, where they deliberately killed civilians, and also attacked military bases. At least 1,100 people were killed, the majority of them civilians, according to Israeli officials.

The attackers took about 240 people hostage, including children, people with disabilities, and older people. Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in Gaza have also since October 7 launched thousands of rockets at Israeli towns, violating the prohibition against indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian objects. The deliberate killing of civilians and captured combatants, taking of hostages, and indiscriminate rocket attacks are serious violations of the laws of war that are war crimes.

The hostilities that began on October 7, like the fighting in 2008, 2012, 2014, 2018, 2019, and 2021, took place amid Israel’s sweeping, unlawful closure of the Gaza Strip, which began in 2007. Human Rights Watch determined in 2021 that the Israeli government’s repressive rule over Palestinians amounts to the crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution.

During previous hostilities, Israeli forces repeatedly carried out indiscriminate airstrikes that killed and injured numerous civilians – wiping out entire families – with no evident military targets in the vicinity. Strikes have targeted and destroyed high-rise towers in Gaza full of residences and businesses.

Since October 7, the Israeli authorities have cut off essential services, including water and electricity, to Gaza, which constitutes collective punishment, and blocked the entry and distribution of life-saving assistance, including food, water, and medicine, which are war crimes. The World Health Organization (WHO) warned on January 31 that the population of Gaza is “starving to death.” Human Rights Watch has documented that the Israeli government is using starvation as a weapon of war, a war crime.

The Israeli military has reported that between October 7 and February 20, it carried out 31,000 airstrikes in Gaza. Israeli airstrikes have hit large residential buildings, food aid distribution centers, medical facilities, humanitarian worker residential compounds, schools, shelters, universities, water infrastructure and wells, and reduced large parts of neighborhoods to rubble, including in attacks that were apparently unlawful and should be investigated as possible war crimes. Israeli forces have also unlawfully used white phosphorous in Gaza. Amnesty International has also documented airstrikes killing civilians.

The primary United Nations aid agency for Palestinian refugees, the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), estimated that as of mid-March, about 1.7 million people in Gaza had been displaced from their homes: about 75 percent of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million. Israeli military authorities have ordered the majority of Gaza’s population to evacuate their homes, risking the war crime of forced displacement.

On October 10, the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry stated that there was “clear evidence” of war crimes in Israel and Gaza and that it would share information with relevant judicial authorities, including the International Criminal Court.

Israeli Airstrike on the Engineers’ Building

At about 2:30 p.m. on October 31, an Israeli airstrike involving four munitions struck and destroyed the six-story Mohandiseen (Engineers’) Building, also known as the Engineers’ Tower, according to witnesses. The building was in a residential area, about 400 meters from the southern limits of the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza. The Human Rights Watch investigation found no indication of a military objective in or near the building on October 31.

Human Rights Watch spoke by phone with 16 people who had knowledge of the attack. Seven described what they saw during and immediately afterward, including one survivor who was in the building, three who were in their homes nearby at the time of the attack and who lost relatives, two who lost relatives and who lived in the building but had left just before the attack, and one who lived nearby who didn’t lose any relatives in the attack. Human Rights Watch also spoke with five relatives of people killed who live outside Gaza. Four other people who lived near the building but who did not see the aftermath, including one who lost relatives in the attack, also gave researchers the names of people whom they learned had been killed.

Human Rights Watch confirmed the identities of 106 people killed in the attack, and 2 of those injured, through interviews with their relatives. The dead include 34 women, 18 men and 54 children. The injured include a 17-year-old girl and a woman.

103 of the dead were from 14 families that were staying in the building. The other three, from two other families, were the boys who lived about 60 meters away and had been playing football in the street.

Airwars reviewed social media and other open sources for information about the attack, and found mentions of the names of 112 people killed, as well as mentions of 19 other people identified only through their relationship to other victims in their family. These include 42 women, 22 men, 62 children, and 5 people whose ages are unknown. Airwars also found in open sources the names of 6 people who were injured. The dead are from 22 families.

Both organizations identified 96 of those killed by name, while Airwars alone identified an additional 15 by name, and Human Rights Watch alone identified an additional 9 by name.

The two organizations between them identified 136 people killed in the attack: 44 women, 22 men, 65 children, and 5 people whose age is unknown. They were from 24 families: Abu Daqqa, Abdeljawad, Abdelrahman, Abdo, Abu Jazar, Abu Jiyab, Abu Saeed, Agha, Ali, Dabaki, Farkh, Hanafi, Ijla, Jweifel, Kuhail, Mabhouh, Mubasher, Quqa, Sadoudi, Saleha, Shaheen, Sharif, Thawabta and Younis.

Human Rights Watch was unable to establish how many of the bodies were recovered and how many remain under the rubble. It is possible, though unlikely, that people whose bodies were not recovered survived and relocated elsewhere in Gaza without their families’ knowledge.

The Engineers’ Building: Sheltering, Serving Hundreds

Verified photographs of the Engineers’ Building posted online prior to the attack show a six-story building, 25 by 25 meters, and about 20 meters high.

Residents and others familiar with the building said it had 20 apartments of about 150 square meters on five floors, which were full of people during the hostilities. In the early afternoon, the small ground-floor grocery store was usually thronged with people wanting to charge their phones there amid Israel’s electricity cuts. The store could offer this service because the building was partially powered by 16 solar panels on its roof. The ground floor also had a gym, a poultry shop, and a video games arcade.

While the origin of the building’s name is unclear, no accounts suggested that the building was being used for engineering purposes. One resident said that the building got its name from the engineers’ union that built it for its members. Another said the building was owned by an engineering consultancy office. A third person said that many of the engineers and their families who had originally lived in the building had since moved out, leaving three known engineering families, and that over time other people had moved in.

Based on interviews and other sources, Human Rights Watch estimates that as of October 31, at least 350 people were staying in the building, including about 125 people known to have been crammed into just 5 apartments. The total includes at least 200 residents and at least 150 displaced Gaza residents, including dozens sheltering in the gym. Some of the displaced people sheltering in the building had followed the Israeli military’s October 13 directive to residents of northern Gaza to move south of Wadi Gaza, a coastal wetland that cuts across Gaza from west to east. They included at least 23 members of an extended family who fled Gaza City and who were all killed in the attack: Eman Khaled Abu Said, her husband, their two children, and her parents, as well as five of her siblings and 11 other relatives. Human Rights Watch obtained from Eman Abu Said’s sister, Israa Abu Said, the names of 23 members of the extended family who were killed in the attack.

It is unclear how many people were in the building, including at the grocery store, at the time of the attack.

Streets Filled with Children Playing at Time of Attack

Neighbors said that streets near the Engineers’ Building were bustling with local residents just before the attack.

Rami Abdo, who lived about 60 meters away, said that about half an hour before the attack, one of his sons, Mohammed Rami Abdo, 11, and two of his nephews, Mohammed Hatem Abdo, 13, and Mohammed Nidal al-Mabhouh, 8, had gone outside to play football with dozens of other children just outside one of the entrances to the building. All three boys died in the attack.

A local resident said that just before the attack, the building was the only place in the area that had electricity and that she saw many people charging their phones in the grocery store.

The Attack and Its Immediate Aftermath

Ameera Shaheen, her husband, daughter and parents had fled their home in al-Moghraqa village in central Gaza the day before the attack after the Israeli military told residents to evacuate the area. They moved into a third-floor apartment in the Engineers’ Building where her aunt, Wafa’ Shaheen, her family of four and about 15 other relatives were staying. She said:

There was nothing worrying at all before the attack. Almost all of us were sitting in two rooms, one for men and one for women. Some of us were laughing. We had just baked bread. There were no signs or warning or any feeling of danger. We felt safe because it was an apartment building full of civilians.

Suddenly, there was an explosion and we started screaming. I remember thinking it hadn’t destroyed the building. And then I was falling, and then I lost consciousness. I woke up later that day in the al-Aqsa Martyr’s Hospital. I only had bruises. I don’t remember anything about waking up, but my relatives told me that I started screaming and calling for my daughter, asking them to go and rescue her although she was sitting there next to me, on my hospital bed.

Shaheen said that the attack killed 20 of her relatives, including 6 women, 7 men, and 7 children.

Hatem Abdo, who lived about 60 meters from the building, said the last time he saw his 13-year-old son, Mohammed, was an hour or so before the attack when he left the house:

Mohammed always used to play football in the street close by with his cousins and other children. At about 2:30 p.m. I was napping at home. Suddenly there were four explosions, with about two or three seconds between each blast. After the first explosion, I woke up and looked out of the window.

I saw about 50 children and some young men in the street, near the southern side of the Engineers’ building. I saw that the northern side of the building had been hit. Immediately, the second bomb hit the southern side, which I could see clearly from my home. I saw debris from the building falling and trapping about 20 of the children, as well as some of the adults.

Then the third bomb hit the top of the building, right in the middle, and the entire building came down, causing a huge black cloud of smoke and dust. It smelled like gunpowder. Then, the fourth one hit, which I didn’t see because of all the dust and smoke.

His brother, Rami Abdo, who lived with his family in the apartment below, was also at home at the time of the attack and said his son was playing football with his cousins and other children outside. He said he heard four explosions “which happened almost at the same time” and that the glass and debris from their building injured two of his daughters in the living room.

Another woman who lived about 30 meters away said she heard “three or four loud bombs explode.”

Both Rami and Hatem Abdo ran out of their building moments after the attack to find the young boys from their families. When they reached the street in front of the destroyed building, Rami said he saw “about 20 burned bodies” in the street, including the bodies of 3 children he recognized from the Abu Rahma family, who he said lived in the building. Hatem said he saw “dozens of bodies in the street,” some near and partially under the rubble of the building next to where it had stood, while others were dozens of meters away.

Both men then found their sister’s son, Mohammed Nidal al-Mabhouh, 8, who was still alive but badly burned, and they took him to an ambulance, which transported him to al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah. He died about eight weeks later. They then found Rami’s son, Mohammed Rami Abdo, 11, under concrete bars in the rubble of the building. Although the men said they quickly freed Mohammed, he died in an ambulance shortly afterward.

Both men then searched for Hatem’s son, Mohammed Hatem Abdo, 13, but could not find him. While looking for him, they helped carry the dead to waiting ambulances. Hatem estimated he helped carry about 60 bodies, mostly children and women, most found on the southern side of the building, including some recovered from rubble on the street. Medics later informed Hatem that his son had been found dead in the street, about 100 meters from the building.

Naheed Mahmoud lived close to the Engineers’ Building after fleeing her home. She lost six of her nieces, a nephew, and her sister’s mother-in-law in the attack. Her sister, Ola Mahmoud Jweifel, 39, and Ola’s only surviving daughter, Nada Hisham Jweifel, 17, who had moved into an apartment on the fourth floor of the Engineers’ Building in July 2023, were injured, with Nada requiring over 10 surgeries to one of her legs. As soon as the third or fourth explosion had happened and it was clear that the attack was over, Naheed ran to the building to find her sister and her sister’s children:

I was screaming and yelling and so was everyone else. The area was immediately filled with people, journalists, and civil defense [body providing emergency services and rescue], so we couldn’t reach the building. The situation was terrible. People were trying to free those trapped under the rubble using anything they could.

After some time, someone told me they found my sister Ola under the rubble. It took until about four hours after the attack to free her. She had a broken pelvis, a broken spine, a broken clavicle bone, and her whole body was black and blue from [being bruised by] the rubble. Then they said they had found her daughter, my niece, Nada. Her upper body was visible, but her lower body was crushed under the rubble. One of her legs was split open from top to bottom. Her blood was everywhere. She was in severe pain, yelling and screaming, and the other leg started to get bigger and bigger. It took until about 11 p.m. that night to free her.

Human Rights Watch spoke with Karam al-Sharif, an UNRWA employee, who lost five of his children and five other relatives in the attack. Three photographs taken by an Associated Press photographer on October 31 at the destroyed Engineers’ Building show al-Sharif standing in the rubble on October 31, holding one of his 18-month-old twin boys who were killed. The Associated Press also reported on the deaths of four of the five children who were killed.

Thirty-five photographs and 45 videos posted on social media and by media outlets and verified by Human Rights Watch show many victims and survivors and the Engineers’ Building reduced to rubble, with significant debris on the northeast, southeast and southwest sides of the building. Human Rights Watch matched the nearby buildings, trees, and roads visible in the footage with satellite imagery to confirm they showed the attacked building. Human Rights Watch also verified an aerial video that showed the building completely flattened. A photograph posted to Facebook on October 31, taken from the Salah al-Din Road approximately 225 meters southeast of the building, shows two large, dark columns of smoke rising from the location of the Engineers’ Building.

Satellite imagery taken at 10:23 a.m. local time on October 31 shows no signs of damage. Imagery taken at 10:18 a.m. local time on November 1 shows that the building is destroyed.

Human Rights Watch determined that the building most likely sustained direct hits from four air-launched munitions. Human Rights Watch found no evidence of remnants at the scene that might have helped identify the weapon. However, the blast damage and the resulting demolition of the building is consistent with the explosive payload of large air-delivered munitions. Witnesses described four munitions striking the building in quick succession, demolishing it. This is consistent with the Israeli military’s past targeting and destruction of buildings through the use of large, air-dropped munitions.

No Known Military Target

Everyone Human Rights Watch interviewed who knew the building well said they were not aware of Palestinian fighters or military equipment in or near the building at the time of the attack. The Human Rights Watch analysis of 80 photographs and videos, as well as satellite imagery of the building and surrounding area, also provided no indication of any Palestinian armed groups’ presence or of military equipment in or near the building at the time of the attack.

All those interviewed said they were unaware of any victims or survivors of the attack who were associated with any armed group. Human Rights Watch found no evidence that any of the victims were combatants. Human Rights Watch reviewed the Telegram channels and associated social media channels of both Hamas’ armed wing, Izz a-Din al-Qassam Brigades, and Islamic Jihad’s armed wing, al-Quds Brigade, two of the main groups involved in the October 7 attacks in Israel. Neither of them mentioned the October 31 strike.

The Israeli military has presented no information that would demonstrate the existence of a military target or other military objective within or near the building. The military has also not said why circumstances did not permit providing an effective advance warning to the residents of the building, and nearby buildings, to evacuate before the attack.

On February 6, Haaretz reported that the Israeli military had begun investigating “dozens of cases” in which its forces may have violated the laws of war. They include an airstrike at around 3:30 p.m. on October 31, about an hour after the Engineers’ Building attack, which the Israeli military said targeted Ibrahim Biari, commander of Hamas’ Jabalia Brigade. The attack in the Jabalia refugee camp, about 14 kilometers northeast of the Engineers’ Building, killed Biari and at least 126 civilians, including 69 children, and injured 280, according to Airwars.

Recovery and Burial of Bodies

Human Rights Watch interviewed three people involved in recovering bodies from the rubble of the Engineers’ building.

Hatem Abdo and Rami Abdo said that they helped recover between 60 and 70 bodies on the afternoon of October 31, and that they recovered about 80 more bodies over the next 4 days. Hatem Abdo said that many were laid out in the street in front of his home until they were taken away. He said relatives of the missing and others collected money to buy diesel fuel so that an excavator, which arrived on November 1, could work for between three and four hours each day to remove rubble.

Hatem said that when the excavator stopped its work, he heard from other people that 56 people were still missing. “They just vanished,” he said.

Majdi Salha fled his nearby home in mid-October, after an attack almost hit his building, and he moved with his family into his brother-in-law’s apartment in the Engineers’ Building. He left the building a few minutes before the attack, which killed 16 of his relatives: his wife and 5 of their daughters; his wife’s brother, his wife’s brother’s wife, and 5 of their children; and his wife’s sister and 2 of her children. He said:

Before I left the apartment to buy bread, I gave my youngest daughter, Lana, who was 10 years old, some money to go after lunch to buy some things in the grocery store on the ground floor of the building. Someone later told me she had gone to the store just before the attack happened.

For 12 days, I helped recover bodies from the rubble. I contributed my own money for fuel to power the excavator. We found almost all the bodies of my family members on days five, six, and seven after the attack happened. But we only found Lana’s body under the rubble on day 10. I think other bodies remained under the rubble after the excavator stopped doing its work.

Another person said he had heard that the people recovering bodies could not retrieve the bodies of the people who had been on the lower levels of the building, so the building “became a graveyard.”

Satellite imagery shows that the removal of rubble stopped between November 7 and 11. The same amount of rubble visible in imagery from November 11 appears in imagery taken on March 12, 2024.

Some people interviewed said they took bodies to or found relatives’ bodies in al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, about four kilometers southwest of the building. One of the men who recovered bodies said that all the bodies recovered from or near the Engineers’ Building were taken to the al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital for identification and registration before burial. Human Rights Watch was unable to obtain a list of people killed in the attack who were registered at that hospital.

Television news reported from al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital on October 31 that “ambulances are still recovering the injured and moving them to [the] hospital” and that the initial group of ambulances had brought 45 victims to the hospital.

A man said he had been told that very badly injured victims were taken to the European Hospital in Khan Younis. Five people said their relatives were buried variously in al-Nuseirat refugee camp, al-Buriej refugee camp, the town of Zawaydeh, and in al-Maghazi cemetery. Majdi Salha said that between November 1 and 13, he went to the burials of 100 people who were killed during the attack on the Engineers’ Building in al-Maghazi cemetery.

Human Rights Watch verified 12 videos and a photograph posted on social media platforms that show the removal of six bodies, including two children and an older woman, from the rubble of the Engineers’ Building; five bodies on stretchers being removed from the building; and two bodies of children taken to the hospital after the attack. They also show an older woman who is either dead or unconscious being carried on a stretcher.

Another video, filmed by the journalist Motaz Azaiza and posted to Instagram on October 31, shows what appears to be a small, burned body wrapped in a sheet. Azaiza narrates that the body of a child was being removed from the second floor of a building next to the Engineers’ Building. The camera pans to a bedroom in that building and shows a child’s race-car-shaped bed partially covered by rubble.

Human Rights Watch verified three videos and a photograph that show the result of a caesarean section performed at al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital on one of the deceased victims in an unsuccessful attempt to save her baby. Human Rights Watch also verified eight videos that show seven injured people, including four children and one woman, being rescued from the Engineers’ Building.

Accountability Initiatives

On May 27, 2021, the UN Human Rights Council established a Commission of Inquiry to address violations and abuses in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel. On October 10, 2023, the commission announced that it was “investigating possible international crimes and violations of international human rights law committed in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory since 7 October 2023” and that it would “continue sharing information collected with the relevant judicial authorities, especially with the International Criminal Court.”

The ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, confirmed that his office has, since March 2021, been conducting an investigation into alleged atrocity crimes committed in Gaza and the West Bank since 2014, and that his office has jurisdiction over crimes in the current hostilities between Israel and Palestinian armed groups that covers unlawful conduct by all parties. He visited Israel and Palestine in December.

Governments should publicly express their support for the ICC in delivering impartial justice, including in its investigation of the situation of Palestine, and commit to ensuring that the ICC has the political, diplomatic and financial support it needs to carry out its global mandate.

Separately, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on January 26 and on March 28 issued provisional measures as part of a case brought by South Africa alleging that Israel is violating the Genocide Convention. The court adopted measures that include requiring Israel to prevent genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, enable the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance, and prevent and punish incitement to commit genocide. Human Rights Watch has found that Israel is not complying with at least one of the court’s binding orders by continuing to obstruct the provision of basic services and the entry and distribution within Gaza of fuel and lifesaving aid.

National judicial authorities should also investigate and prosecute those implicated in serious crimes in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel under the principle of universal jurisdiction and in accordance with national laws. Governments should impose individual sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes, against officials and individuals credibly implicated in the commission of grave abuses.

The UN Secretary-General should also include Israel in the list of those responsible for grave violations against children, annexed to his 2024 annual report to the Security Council on children and armed conflict, for violations including killing and maiming.

Arms Transfers

Numerous UN special rapporteurs, independent experts and working groups issued a statement on February 23 that the transfer of weapons or ammunition to Israel that would be used in Gaza would most likely violate international humanitarian law and needed to cease immediately. Providing arms that knowingly and significantly would contribute to unlawful attacks can make those providing them complicit in war crimes.

The Dutch Court of Appeal ordered the Netherlands on February 11 to halt its export of F-35 fighter jet parts to Israel, given the clear risk they might be used in committing serious violations of international humanitarian law in Gaza. The Dutch government is appealing this decision. Canada’s foreign minister said on March 20 that Canada will continue to freeze new arms export permits to Israel, following the passage of a nonbinding House of Commons resolution calling for “ceasing the further authorization and transfer of arms exports to Israel to ensure compliance with Canada’s arms export regime.”

The Biden administration issued a National Security Memo in February that establishes that the United States Departments of State and Defense will receive written assurances from countries that receive US military assistance that they use US-origin “defense articles” in compliance with international law and that they have not arbitrarily impeded or delayed US-funded or supported humanitarian assistance during 2023. Based on their observations and investigations in Gaza, however, Human Rights Watch along with Oxfam have concluded that any assurances made by Israeli officials to use US weapons in compliance with international and US law are not credible.

A United Nations human rights body has criticized the United Kingdom government for “involuntary, compulsory treatment and detention” of people with disabilities inside and outside hospitals and urged UK authorities to guarantee access to community-based services.

The Human Rights Committee, a body of independent experts that monitors implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by states’ parties to the treaty, published its findings last week following review of the UK’s record. The Committee highlighted how authorities continue to detain and involuntarily treat people with disabilities under the UK Mental Health Act, based solely on their actual or perceived disability. The Committee expressed concern that the average length of stay for people with learning disabilities and autism detained under the act is over two years.

UK-based organizations representing people with disabilities and their families have been sounding the alarm about this issue for years, and the UK media has consistently exposed abuse in psychiatric units across the country. In one case reported by the BBC, at least eight members of staff at a hospital were seen picking up a young woman with autism and dragging her to a seclusion room, where she had already spent over two weeks.

The UN expert on torture has noted that “involuntary treatment and other psychiatric interventions in health-care facilities” can be forms of torture and ill-treatment.

An investigation by The Independent and Sky News recently revealed that almost 20,000 sexual abuse incidents were reported in NHS-run hospitals in the last five years. Latest data indicates that over 2,000 people with learning disabilities and autism are still in inpatient units, despite the government’s commitment to reduce the number of inpatient beds by 50% from March 2015 to March 2024 and develop community-based services.

The UK government should heed the Committee’s call and amend the Mental Health Act and Mental Capacity Act to ensure people with disabilities aren’t locked up in institutions against their will. Instead, it should strengthen and develop voluntary, rights-respecting services so everyone has access to adequate support that allows them to live in their own communities with dignity.",HIGH,20240404T140000Z,United Nations Human Rights Committee,UN expert on torture,UK government,NHS-run hospitals,Amend UK legislation to prevent involuntary detention; develop community-based services,"Involuntary, compulsory treatment and detention of people with disabilities",United Kingdom,Systemic issues in mental health care and treatment of disabilities

Myanmar’s already abysmal human rights situation is getting worse.

That’s what senior United Nations officials told the UN Security Council on April 4, during a rare open meeting on Myanmar, its first since February 2019.

The council heard of a spiraling human rights and humanitarian catastrophe, with particularly worrisome abuses in Rakhine State. Conflict has “weakened transnational security” and instability has led to a crisis with “global implications,” officials said.

In December 2022, the council adopted Resolution 2669, condemning the Myanmar military’s abuses and attacks on civilians since its February 2021 coup. The resolution called on the military to release political prisoners, restore democratic institutions, and engage in dialogue.

Since then, however, the Security Council has been largely silent on the situation.

Meanwhile, Myanmar’s junta has ramped up attacks on civilians, including airstrikes, and increasingly blocked humanitarian aid. Refugees are fleeing to Bangladesh, China, India, and Thailand. Thousands of Rohingya are making dangerous journeys by sea to find refuge in Indonesia, Malaysia, and elsewhere.

The open meeting occurred the same day as the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva adopted a new resolution on Myanmar, which urged the UN secretary-general and General Assembly to renew attention to Myanmar at the Security Council.

The Security Council should take more meaningful steps to address rights concerns, including instituting an arms embargo, referring the situation to the International Criminal Court, and imposing targeted sanctions on military-owned companies. Regional efforts by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have been utterly inadequate.

The Human Rights Council’s April 4 resolution calls for restricting the Myanmar military’s access to jet fuel, a call echoed by the United States at the Security Council meeting.

But at the Security Council, China and Russia continue to block consideration of an embargo or any other measures, and now oppose even holding debates. At the Security Council meeting, both disputed that the situation in Myanmar was within the council’s mandate.

Almost every other member government raised serious concerns about the crisis, and many bemoaned the body’s inaction.

The Security Council needs to act. Even countries usually not in favor of strong UN action on human rights in Myanmar should recognize the dangers of continued inaction.

As a Japanese delegate put it, the Security Council’s inaction is not what the people of Myanmar “expect from this august body.”",VERY HIGH,20240404T214500Z,United Nations Security Council,,Myanmar military,"Rakhine State, Myanmar",,Abuses and attacks on civilians,Myanmar,"Military coup, ongoing conflict, humanitarian blockade"

In an unprecedented move, the United Nations committee of independent child rights experts has cancelled an upcoming series of meetings due to lack of funds.

The shortfall was caused by the failure of some countries to pay their membership dues.

This is the latest example of the UN’s human rights monitoring role being undermined by a lack of budgeted funds, and comes on the heels of vacancy freezes at the global organization, and a forced reduction of field investigations conducted by its rights experts.

At the now-cancelled session of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the experts were expected to meet – in a safe and confidential manner – with children, civil society organizations, and UN agencies to discuss the child rights records of eight countries.

The cancellation means less scrutiny of developments in Ecuador, where escalating violence and organized crime activity is having a dire impact on children’s rights, particularly girls who have a right to study in safety.

It also means the situation in Ethiopia may further fly under the radar, even as children are killed, injured, and sexually assaulted; and schools attacked and used by military forces, in the conflicts in the country’s north.

The experts will no longer have the opportunity to learn about girls from Indonesia who may have been forced to leave school or withdraw under pressure, due to their decision not to follow local mandatory hijab regulations.

It will now be more difficult for the committee to learn about the ill treatment of children in government-run detention centers in Iraq, or the government’s failure to prohibit corporal punishment against children.

And the voices of girls unable to exercise their right to education in Pakistan will continue to be silenced.

If the committee cannot learn about these problems, they also cannot make recommendations for change.

Today, the United Nations Human Rights Council adopted a resolution establishing a new investigative body to advance accountability for international crimes committed by Belarusian authorities. This sends a strong message to perpetrators that their crimes will not go unpunished.

The new body – which was advocated for by Belarusian and international rights groups, including Human Rights Watch – has a mandate to investigate grave ongoing abuses, collect and preserve evidence of international crimes, and identify those responsible, building on the work of the UN Human Rights Office’s own investigation.

The resolution also renewed the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Belarus, a lifeline to civil society in a context where human rights work has effectively been outlawed.

The adoption of today’s resolution, supported by countries from all regions, demonstrates the growing international concern over Belarus’ escalating rights crisis.

Belarusian authorities have continued their “purge” of independent voices. Hundreds remain behind bars on politically motivated charges, facing ill-treatment and incommunicado detention. Rights defenders, including five members of prominent Belarusian rights group Viasna, are serving politically motivated sentences of up to fifteen years. Authorities have also retaliated against human rights lawyers for representing clients in politically motivated cases.

There is currently no meaningful avenue to justice for such abuses within Belarus and very few avenues in international fora. In 2022, Belarusian authorities officially blocked victims of human rights violations from bringing their complaints before the UN’s Human Rights Committee.

Based on its own independent investigations, the UN Human Rights Office has concluded that grave human rights violations committed in Belarus since the crackdown began in 2020 may amount to crimes against humanity, a conclusion that clearly warrants the robust response delivered by today’s resolution.

While the new investigative body will not resolve the rights crisis in Belarus overnight, its work will be vital in efforts to hold those responsible for these crimes accountable. It will also support human rights defenders and survivors of human rights violations who want recognition of and justice for crimes committed. The UN leadership should ensure – despite the current liquidity crisis – that the new mechanism has the support and resources to start its work immediately.",VERY HIGH,20240404T160000Z,United Nations Human Rights Council,"Members of Viasna, political prisoners",Belarusian authorities,Belarus,Ensure support and resources for new mechanism to begin its work immediately,"Grave ongoing human rights abuses, crimes against humanity",Belarus,"Political repression, crackdown on dissent"

Impact of Lead Pollution on Children’s Rights (articles 5, 12, and 14)

Lead contamination around the former lead and zinc mine in the town of Kabwe continues to have disastrous effects on children’s health, and action is urgently needed to protect child rights.[1]

Kabwe is one of the world’s worst pollution hotspots because of contamination from a former lead and zinc mine established during the British colonial period.[2] The mine was closed in 1994, but toxic waste remains. Lead dust from its large, uncovered waste dumps blows across nearby residential areas, exposing up to 200,000 people to high levels of toxic lead.[3] The situation is compounded by small-scale and informal mining activities at the former mine site. Health researchers have estimated that over 95 percent of children living near the former mine in Kabwe have elevated lead levels in their blood. About half of them require urgent medical intervention.[4]

Children under age 5 and pregnant and breastfeeding women are among the most vulnerable to lead poisoning.[5] Among pregnant women, lead exposure can result in stillbirth, miscarriage, and low birth weight and can negatively affect the brain development of a fetus. The consequences for children include reading and learning barriers or disabilities; behavioral problems; impaired growth; anemia; brain, liver, kidney, nerve, and stomach damage; coma and convulsions; and death. More than 90 percent of lead stores are in bone, but pregnancy and lactation increase bone turnover, which may result in lead moving into the blood. As a result, “[s]ince bone lead stores persist for decades, women and their infants may be at risk for continued exposure long after exposure to external environmental sources has been terminated.”[6] Calcium deficiency may increase bone turnover since maternal bone is a major source of calcium for the developing fetus and nursing infant.[7]

Poor children are disproportionately affected because undernourishment increases the amount of lead the body absorbs, and because many live in informal settlements that lack paved roads and planted areas that contain the lead dust.[8]

The government has a duty to ensure that human rights, including child rights, are protected in the context of business operations, and companies have a responsibility to respect human rights including child rights in their own operations and in their supply chains, and provide remedies when they have caused or contributed to adverse impacts.

In 2020, lawyers from South Africa and the United Kingdom filed a class action lawsuit in a South African court on behalf of affected children and women of child-bearing age in Kabwe.[9] The lawsuit seeks compensation, a lead-screening system for children and pregnant women, and remediation of the area. The lawsuit contends that the mine was operated and managed by the company Anglo American between 1925 and 1974, while Anglo American argues it did not own or operate the mine, but only provided “technical services.”[10]

In December 2023, the South African High Court ruled against the case proceeding, describing it as an “unmanageable claim that would set a grave precedent.”[11] Lawyers for the plaintiffs have announced they will appeal.

With a World Bank loan, Zambia’s government has undertaken some limited efforts to address the contamination in Kabwe.[12] It has tested and treated some children and cleaned up a small number of homes and a highly polluted canal, but it has failed to clean up the source of the contamination.[13] As long as the waste dumps are not cleaned up, other measures are unsustainable, and progress made could be quickly reversed. Moreover, the government has licensed further mining and reprocessing activities that pose additional health risks to children.[14]

In March 2022, President Hakainde Hichilema instructed the Ministry of Green Economy and Environment to establish a technical committee to “address and lead the process of comprehensive remediation” in Kabwe. However, after an initial informal meeting in June 2022, the technical committee was never formally set up. In 2023, the ministry announced its intention to make Kabwe a “Green City” where economic development takes place “on top of buried lead surfaces.”[15] But it remains unclear how the ministry is planning to turn this vision into reality.

Human Rights Watch recommends that the Committee ask Zambia’s government:

Has the government of Zambia taken steps to develop a comprehensive remediation plan for the containment or removal of lead waste at Kabwe mine?

What has the government of Zambia done to seek technical and financial support for the development and implementation of a comprehensive remediation plan?

Could the government provide an update on voluntary lead testing and (where clinically indicated) chelation treatment efforts in Kabwe, including the age range of children tested and treated, and future plans for testing and (where clinically indicated) treating older children and women of reproductive age?

Human Rights Watch recommends that the Committee call upon Zambia’s government to:

Ensure that children who have suffered adverse impacts on their right to health have access to remedy.

Urgently suspend all mining operations and conduct a comprehensive remediation process at the former mine site to ensure the source of the contamination is contained or removed; in order to do so, seek technical and financial support for the development and implementation of a comprehensive remediation plan.

Remediate all contaminated schools, homes, and play areas, and report publicly about progress.

Provide affordable and accessible lead testing and (where clinically indicated) treatment, including chelation therapy, to all children and women of childbearing age in affected neighborhoods.

The North Korean human rights movement won a significant victory on April 4 when the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) adopted a resolution ensuring continued scrutiny of North Korea’s atrocious rights record.

The resolution renews the mandate of the UN special rapporteur on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea) and asks the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare its first comprehensive report on the North Korean human rights situation since the Commission of Inquiry (COI) published its landmark report in 2014. The new resolution also increases resources for the high commissioner’s office to focus on criminal accountability for North Korea’s rights violations and stresses the link between North Korea’s weapons program, international peace and security, and human rights.

It is the UNHRC’s most ambitious resolution on North Korea since 2016 and carries immense importance for victims of serious abuses in a country that is among the most isolated and repressive in the world. In sharp contrast to Russia’s veto at the UN Security Council on March 28 that disbanded the Panel of Experts on North Korea, this resolution demonstrates the commitment of concerned countries to ensure accountability.

The 2014 COI report was a watershed moment, shedding light on egregious rights abuses in North Korea. The new report mandated by the UNHRC, to be published in September 2025, will build on the COI’s recommendations, provide a platform for North Korean victims, particularly those who have suffered since Kim Jong Un took power in December 2011, and amplify their stories on the international stage. By highlighting the connection between North Korea’s weapons development and human rights, the upcoming report will remind governments that security cannot be tackled in isolation from underlying rights abuses.

The UNHRC resolution is a crucial step, but North Korea’s victims are entitled to greater support from international institutions. The UN General Assembly and Security Council should also increase their scrutiny of North Korea, including by exploring connections between rights abuses and weapons proliferation and the need to hold rights violators accountable.",VERY HIGH,20240408T193000Z,United Nations Human Rights Council,Kim Jong Un,North Korean government,Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea),Greater support from international institutions; increased scrutiny of North Korea's human rights and weapons proliferation.,Atrocious human rights record,North Korea,"Political repression, isolation, and linking of human rights abuses to weapons development"

I spent some time this morning looking at house prices in Texas. I wanted to know what 400 million US dollars could buy you.

No, I’m not planning to move to Texas, and no, I don’t have 400 million lying around.

But that’s the amount of money – Texas taxpayers’ money – the Texas Military Department will reportedly be spending to construct a massive new “Forward Operating Base” near the town of Eagle Pass, on the border with Mexico.

The base is just one part of the US state’s anti-migrant program, called “Operation Lone Star.” We’ve talked about Operation Lone Star’s huge budget and deadly abuses in the Daily Brief before, and highlighted the ugly immorality at the core of the program.

We could also mention that it even hasn’t done what the authorities promised it would do. There is no evidence Operation Lone Star has slowed migration. However, it has cost Texas residents as much as US$ 10 billion.

The pointless new military base is expected to house up to 1,800 national guard members. Given average real estate prices in the area, 400 million dollars could buy every one of them an actual house.

Here’s the math. Divide 400 million by 1,800, and you get US$ 222,222. In Maverick County, where Eagle Pass is located, the median sale price of a home is US$ 258,000, which is a bit high, but in the neighboring counties of Dimmit, Kinney and Zavala, it’s 144,000, and 198,000, and 140,000, respectively. So, yes, 400 million could buy 1,800 nice houses in the area.

Or, you could use that money instead to send those 1,800 national guard members to full, four-year degree programs at Texas A&M University. That costs US$ 30,608 a year for in-state residents, including tuition, fees, housing, food, books, transportation, and other expenses. In fact, you could do that and still have nearly 180 million left over. [400,000,000 – (30,608 x 4 x 1,800)]

Now, don’t get me wrong. I’m not really suggesting these spending alternatives. I’m not saying these 1,800 people should be prioritized over others in the state.

I’m simply pointing out that 400 million dollars is a lot of taxpayer money. There are thousands of things authorities could be spending it on.

Can they really think of nothing better to do with that money than further militarize the border and plan to commit yet more human rights abuses under Operation Lone Star?",HIGH,20240411T123000Z,Author,"Texas taxpayers, national guard members",Texas Military Department,"Eagle Pass, Texas",Reallocation of funds to address community needs rather than military expansion,Misallocation of taxpayer funds towards militarization and human rights abuses under Operation Lone Star,United States,"Border security concerns, anti-migrant sentiment"

(Nairobi) – Mali’s transitional military government should immediately reverse its suspension of political parties and associations, Human Rights Watch said today. The suspension violates both Malian law and the rights to freedom of expression, association, and assembly under international human rights law.



On April 10, 2024, the council of ministers adopted a decree suspending the activities of political parties and associations across the country “until further notice.” On April 11, the Malian communications regulatory body (Haute autorité de la communication) directed all media to stop “broadcasting and publishing the activities” of political parties and associations. The action appeared to be in response to the March 31 call by more than 80 political parties and associations for a return to constitutional order by holding presidential elections as soon as possible. The military junta, which seized power in a coup in May 2021, had announced in September that the elections scheduled for March 26 would be delayed indefinitely for technical reasons.



“The Malian authorities apparently suspended all political parties and associations because they didn’t like their call to hold democratic elections,” said Ilaria Allegrozzi, senior Sahel researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Mali’s junta, like all governments, needs to respect human rights, and should immediately lift the suspension.”



Following months of renewed hostilities between separatist armed groups and Malian forces in the northern part of the country, Col. Assimi Goita, Mali’s military president, announced on December 31, 2023, the establishment of an “inter-Malian dialogue for peace and reconciliation,” aimed at eliminating “the roots of community and intercommunity conflicts” by prioritizing “national ownership of the peace process.” In an April 10 news release, Col. Abdoulaye Maïga, the minister of territorial administration, claimed the suspension of political parties and associations was justified to ensure that the inter-Malian dialogue “[would] take place in a climate of serenity and not cacophony.”



“The minister’s declaration has contradictions,” said a member of the political party African Solidarity for Democracy and Independence (Solidarité africaine pour la démocratie et l'indépendance, SADI). “Authorities are inviting people to the national dialogue, and at the same time are stripping them of their political clothes. … Who do they [authorities] want to attend the dialogue? People should be entitled to participate both as citizens and as political leaders or members of political parties.”



In January, the authorities took legal action against the SADI party, threatening to dissolve it, following a message posted on social networks by its leader, Oumar Mariko. Mariko had alleged that the Malian armed forces had committed war crimes against members of the Strategic Permanent Framework (Cadre stratégique permanent), a coalition of armed and political groups from northern Mali.



Since the military coup, Mali’s junta has increasingly cracked down on peaceful dissent, political opposition, civil society, and the media, shrinking the country’s civic space, Human Rights Watch said.



On March 13, the minister of territorial administration dissolved the Association of Pupils and Students of Mali (L’Association des élèves et étudiants du Mali) accusing its members of “violence and clashes in schools and universities.” The association was the fourth organization that the government dissolved in less than four months. On March 6, the authorities had dissolved the Coordination of Movements, Associations, and Sympathizers of Imam Mahmoud Dicko (Coordination des mouvements, associations et sympathisants de l’imam Mahmoud Dicko), which had been calling for presidential elections as part of restoring civilian democratic rule, accusing it of “destabilization and threat to public security.”



On February 28, the authorities had dissolved the political organization Kaoural Renewal (Kaoural Renouveau), citing “defamatory and subversive remarks” against the military junta. And on December 20, the authorities had dissolved the Observatory for Elections and Good Governance (Observatoire pour les élections et la bonne gouvernance), a civil society group that monitored the fairness of elections, accusing its chairman of “statements likely to disturb public order.”



The junta has also targeted dissidents and whistleblowers. On March 4, the authorities forcibly disappeared gendarmerie Col. Alpha Yaya Sangaré, who had recently published a book about abuses by the Malian armed forces. His whereabouts remain unknown.



A Malian human rights activist said that “the authorities want to maintain a monopoly over political power by denying opponents the right to express their views and conduct political activities.”



Mali’s constitution and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Mali ratified in 1974, protect the rights to freedom of association, expression, and peaceful assembly. Article 25 of the ICCPR ensures the right of citizens to participate in public affairs. The United Nations Human Rights Committee, the body of independent experts that monitor state compliance with the convention, has upheld everyone’s right to “join organizations and associations concerned with political and public affairs.”



“The junta’s decision to suspend political parties is part of its relentless crackdown on peaceful opposition and dissent,” Allegrozzi said. “The authorities should immediately lift the suspension, allow the political parties and associations to operate freely, and commit to upholding fundamental rights and freedoms.”",HIGH,20240412T051500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Abdoulaye Maïga, Ilaria Allegrozzi, Oumar Mariko, Col.

He was identifying a problem underpinning Japan’s system for providing care to children whose parents were unable or unwilling to do so: it had become a business opportunity. Government subsidies to privately run childcare institutions entrenched their opposition to reform and created an incentive to prefer more resident children rather than having children being placed with families who would love and nurture them.

But last week, new reforms came into effect in Japan that might begin to change that financial calculation.

The new system, established by a 2022 law, offers private childcare institutions financing to transform their business model into “Foster Care Support Centers” that recruit, train, select, and support foster parents, and assist the independence of children living in foster families.

If a childcare institution becomes a Foster Care Support Center, the government will fund full-time staff members based on the number of foster households they cater to.

This change was brought about through the hard work of a small group of activists and lawmakers, who for more than 10 years have strived to push back on institutions’ strong lobbying efforts.

When I met Kenji, almost 40,000 children were in Japan’s alternative care system, less than 12 percent were living in a foster family, and the vast majority were living in institutions. In 2017, the Japanese government set a target to have 75 percent of infants and toddlers in foster families, and 50 percent of school-aged children in foster families. But as of 2022, only 24 percent of children were being cared for in foster families.

The latest reform is an important step, but further changes are needed, such as the speedy closure of all infant care institutions.

If that cannot be with their biological parents, alternative solutions should not include institutions, but close relatives, or adoptive or foster families, where they are genuinely loved.",HIGH,20240408T134500Z,Kenji M.,Kenji M.,Japanese childcare institutions,"Tokyo, Japan","Closure of all infant care institutions, emphasis on placing children with families instead of institutions",Failure to provide loving care and support to children,Japan,Business model of childcare institutions incentivizing the maintenance of children in institutions

(Nairobi) – Senegal’s newly elected president, Bassirou Diomaye Faye, should make protecting and promoting human rights a priority during his presidency, both within Senegal and regionally, Human Rights Watch said in a letter to the president made public today.

Human Rights Watch outlined five key recommendations to improve human rights in Senegal, urging Faye, during his term in office, to fight impunity for security forces’ abuse; promote and protect the rights to freedom of expression, assembly, and association; improve prison conditions; prioritize rights and saving lives when addressing irregular migration; and develop a foreign policy based on human rights. He should support rights-respecting democracies in West Africa and moves to strengthen the system of international justice.

“Faye has an important opportunity to create a rights-respecting administration that abides by the rule of law,” said Ilaria Allegrozzi, senior Sahel researcher at Human Rights Watch. “He should commit to reforms that will safeguard and advance human rights in the years to come.”



Faye, 44, the youngest president in Senegal’s history, was sworn into office on April 2, 2024, following delayed elections, and less than two weeks after he was released from prison, where he was serving a sentence over a Facebook post. On the day he was sworn in, Faye appointed his key backer, Ousmane Sonko, as prime minister.



On February 3, former President Macky Sall announced that presidential elections, slated for February 25, would be delayed, citing an institutional crisis that he said could damage the election’s credibility. In January, Senegal’s constitutional council had decided to exclude several candidates, including Sonko, from the electoral race. Senegal’s parliament set up a commission of inquiry to investigate the council's handling of the vetting process amid accusations of corruption against at least two of the council’s judges.



On February 6, Senegal’s parliament voted to delay the elections to December 15 after a chaotic National Assembly session during which security forces removed opposition lawmakers. This sparked violent protests in the capital, Dakar, and across the country on February 9 and 10, leading to the deaths of four people and the arrest of over 270 others.



On March 13, during a Council of Ministers meeting, following national and international pressure and a decision by Senegal’s constitutional court, Sall shortened the delay and announced that elections would be held on March 24.



The elections followed three years of political unrest, which included Sonko’s arrest in July 2023 and concerns that Sall would seek a third term despite constitutional term limits. The violence shook Senegal’s reputation as an example of a stable democracy in a region ravaged by military coups. Dozens were killed in the protests, and over 1,000 were arrested, including Faye.



Faye is the secretary general of the African Patriots of Senegal for Work, Ethics, and Fraternity (Patriotes africains du Sénégal pour le travail, l'éthique et la fraternité, PASTEF) party, the main opposition group dissolved by the authorities in July 2023. He was arrested on April 14, 2023, following a Facebook message in which he criticized magistrates and was charged with “undermining state security” and fomenting insurrection, among others. Faye was released on March 14 after the National Assembly adopted an amnesty law on March 6.



“By taking bold steps to strengthen human rights protections, President Faye would turn the page on the last years of violence, abuse, and impunity,” Allegrozzi said. “The Senegalese people and the world will be watching his actions closely.”",HIGH,20240408T044500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Bassirou Diomaye Faye, Ousmane Sonko, Macky Sall, Ilaria Allegrozzi",Senegalese government,"Senegal, primarily in Dakar","Prioritize human rights in governance, commit to reforms for law protection, and support rights-respecting democracies.",Impunity for security forces' abuse and violations of human rights.,Senegal,"Political unrest, previous government's actions, exclusion of candidates, delays in elections."

(Beirut, April 9, 2024) – Children in Gaza have been dying from starvation-related complications since the Israeli government began using starvation as a weapon of war, a war crime, Human Rights Watch said today. Doctors and families in Gaza described children, as well as pregnant and breastfeeding mothers, suffering from severe malnutrition and dehydration, and hospitals ill-equipped to treat them.

Concerned governments should impose targeted sanctions and suspend arms transfers to press the Israeli government to ensure access to humanitarian aid and basic services in Gaza, in accordance with Israel’s obligations under international law and the recent International Court of Justice order in South Africa’s genocide case.

“The Israeli government’s use of starvation as a weapon of war has proven deadly for children in Gaza,” said Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch. “Israel needs to end this war crime, stop this suffering, and allow humanitarian aid to reach all of Gaza unhindered.”

A United Nations-coordinated partnership of 15 international organizations and UN agencies investigating the hunger crisis in Gaza reported on March 18, 2024, that “all evidence points towards a major acceleration of death and malnutrition.” The partnership said that in northern Gaza, where 70 percent of the population is estimated to be experiencing catastrophic hunger, famine could occur anytime between mid-March and May.

Gaza’s Health Ministry reported as of April 1, that 32 people, including 28 children, had died of malnutrition and dehydration at hospitals in northern Gaza. Save the Children confirmed on April 2 the deaths from starvation and disease of 27 children. Earlier in March, World Health Organisation (WHO) officials found “children dying of starvation” in northern Gaza’s Kamal Adwan and al-Awda hospitals. In southern Gaza, where aid is more accessible but still grossly inadequate, UN agencies in mid-February said that 5 percent of children under age 2 were found to be acutely malnourished.

Human Rights Watch in March interviewed a doctor in northern Gaza, a volunteer doctor who has since left Gaza, the parents of two infants who doctors said died of starvation-related complications in both mother and child, and the parents of four other children suffering from malnutrition and dehydration.

Human Rights Watch reviewed the death certificate for one of the children, and photos of two of the children in critical condition that showed signs of emaciation. All had been treated at Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza.

Human Rights Watch health advisers also reviewed verified pictures and videos online of three other evidently emaciated children who died and four others in critical condition who also showed signs of emaciation.

Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, who heads Kamal Adwan hospital’s pediatrics unit, told Human Rights Watch on April 4 that 26 children had died after experiencing starvation-related complications in his hospital alone. He said that at least 16 of the children who died were under 5 months old, at least 10 were between 1 and 8 years old, and that a 73-year-old man suffering from malnutrition had also died.

Dr. Safiya said one of the infants died at just two days old after being born severely dehydrated, apparently exacerbated by his mother’s poor health: “[She] had no milk to give him.”

Nour al-Huda, an 11-year-old girl with cystic fibrosis, was admitted to Kamal Adwan hospital on March 15. Doctors there told her mother that Nour was suffering from malnutrition, dehydration, and an infection in her lungs, and administered her oxygen and a saline solution. “Nour al-Huda now weighs 18 kilograms [about 40 pounds],” her mother told Human Rights Watch. “I can see her chest bones sticking out.”

International humanitarian law prohibits the starvation of civilians as a method of warfare. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court provides that intentionally starving civilians by “depriving them of objects indispensable to their survival, including willfully impeding relief supplies,” is a war crime.

Since the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel, the Israeli government has deliberately blocked the delivery of aid, food, and fuel into Gaza, while impeding humanitarian assistance and depriving civilians of the means to survive. Israeli officials ordering or carrying out these actions are committing collective punishment against the civilian population and the starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, both of which are war crimes.

Israeli government actions that undermine the ability of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to carry out its recognized role in distributing aid in Gaza have exacerbated the effects of the restrictions.

A doctor who volunteered at the European hospital in Khan Younis in southern Gaza for two weeks in late January said that medical staff were forced to treat patients with limited medical supplies. He described the difficulty of treating malnutrition and dehydration, lacking essential items such as glucose, electrolytes, and feeding tubes. He said that one patient’s mother, desperate for solutions, resorted to crushing potatoes to create a makeshift liquid for tube feeding. Despite its nutritional inadequacy, the doctor said, “I ended up telling my other patients to find potatoes and do the same.”

On January 26, the International Court of Justice, in a case brought by South Africa, ordered provisional measures, including requiring Israel to “take immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian aid” and other actions to comply with the 1948 Genocide Convention. On March 28, the court indicated that Israel had not complied with this order and imposed a more detailed provisional measure requiring the government to ensure the unimpeded provision of basic services and aid in full cooperation with the UN, while noting that “famine is setting in.”

Governments should impose targeted sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes, against officials and individuals responsible for the continued commission of the war crimes of collective punishment, deliberate obstruction of humanitarian aid and using starvation of civilians as a weapon of war.

Several countries have responded to the Israeli government’s unlawful restrictions on assistance by airdropping aid. The United States also pledged to build a temporary seaport in Gaza. However, aid groups and UN officials have said such efforts are inadequate to prevent a famine. Another attempt to deliver aid by sea was halted after an Israeli attack on aid workers on April 1.

On April 4, the Israeli cabinet agreed to several measures to increase the amount of aid entering Gaza, apparently following pressure from the US government.

“Governments outraged by the Israeli government starving civilians in Gaza should not be looking for band-aid solutions to this humanitarian crisis,” Shakir said. “Israel’s announcement that it will increase aid shows that outside pressure works. Israel’s allies like the US, UK, France, and Germany need to press for full-throttle aid delivery by immediately suspending their arms transfers.”

Starvation in Gaza

Prior to the current hostilities, 1.2 million of Gaza’s then-2.2 million people were estimated to be facing acute food insecurity, and over 80 percent were reliant on humanitarian aid. Israel maintains overarching control over Gaza, including over the movement of people and goods, territorial waters, airspace, the infrastructure upon which Gaza relies, and the population registry. This leaves Gaza’s population, whom Israel has subjected to an unlawful closure for more than 16 years, almost entirely dependent on Israel for access to fuel, electricity, medicine, food, and other essential commodities.

Nonetheless, before October 7, large amounts of humanitarian assistance reached the population. “Before this crisis, there was enough food in Gaza to feed the population,” said WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Malnutrition was a rare occurrence. Now, people are dying, and many more are sick.”

The WHO reported that the number of children under age 5 who are acutely malnourished has jumped from 0.8 percent before the hostilities in Gaza to between 12.4 and 16.5 percent in northern Gaza. Oxfam said on April 3 that since January, people in northern Gaza have been forced to survive on an average of 245 calories a day, “less than a can of fava beans.”

According to a nutrition vulnerability analysis conducted in March by the Global Nutrition Cluster, a network of humanitarian organizations chaired by UNICEF, 90 percent of children ages 6-23 months and pregnant and breastfeeding women across Gaza faced “severe food poverty,” eating two or fewer food groups each day.

Children with preexisting health conditions are particularly vulnerable to the devastating effects of malnutrition, which significantly weakens immunity. And starvation, even for survivors, leads to lasting harm, especially in children, causing stunted growth, cognitive issues, and developmental delays.

Gaza’s Health Ministry announced on March 8 that about 60,000 pregnant women in Gaza suffered from malnutrition, dehydration and inadequate health care. Poor nutrition during pregnancy harms both the baby and the mother, increasing the risk of miscarriages, fetal deaths, compromised immune system development, growth impacts, and maternal mortality.

Older people are also at particular risk of malnutrition, which increases mortality among those with acute or chronic illnesses. HelpAge International reported that even before October, 45 percent of older people in Gaza were going to bed hungry at least once a week, with 6 percent hungry every night.

The impact on Gaza’s population of the Israeli government’s use of starvation as a weapon of war is compounded by the near-total collapse of the healthcare system. Out of Gaza’s 36 hospitals, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), only 10 are operational, none of them fully, both as a result of the Israeli military’s repeated, apparently unlawful attacks on medical facilities, personnel, and transport, as well as the severe restrictions on the entry of fuel and other supplies.

Accounts from Gaza

On March 19, Andrea De Domenico, head of OCHA in the occupied Palestinian territory, visited Kamal Adwan hospital, where he said about 15 malnourished children arrive daily due to shortages in food, water, and proper sanitation. He described dire conditions at the hospital, noting damage to certain areas and its reliance on a single generator.

Among the cases that Human Rights Watch investigated:

A man from Beit Lahia said his infant son, Abdelaziz, died just hours after his severely malnourished mother gave birth to him in Kamal Adwan hospital on February 24. He shared Abdelaziz’s death certificate with Human Rights Watch, which said that Abdelaziz was born premature. His father said that the hospital staff hooked Abdelaziz up to a ventilator because he was having trouble breathing, but that the ventilator stopped working after the hospital ran out of the necessary fuel a few hours later. “Abdelaziz died immediately,” he said. He expressed concern for his wife, who had been surviving on legumes and canned food, emphasizing their ongoing struggle to access adequate nourishment.

The father of newborn twin girls said that one of his babies, Joud, died at Kamal Adwan hospital on March 2 after suffering from malnutrition, eight days after she was born. He said that he struggled to feed his family prior to the girls’ birth, but that they only had bread to eat, without meat or protein. He said that after the twins’ birth, his wife could not produce milk to breastfeed the girls and that store-bought milk was scarce. He described Joud’s deteriorating condition, saying that her “limbs became very cold, and she was breathing very slowly.” His mother-in-law accompanied Joud to the hospital, where she later passed away. The father expressed concern for the health of the surviving twin.

Fadi, a 6-year-old boy from al-Nasser neighborhood in Gaza City, has cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder that causes damage to the lungs. Fadi’s mother said that because of the Israeli blockade, she struggled to obtain the necessary medication and provide adequate nourishment. By mid-January, Fadi’s health had deteriorated to the point where he could no longer walk, prompting his hospitalization. “Fadi weighed 30 kilograms [about 66 pounds] before the war, now he is 12 [about 26 pounds],” she said. Fadi was evacuated from Kamal Adwan hospital on March 23 and was receiving treatment at a hospital in Cairo, a relative said on March 28.

Wissam Hammad, the uncle of 5-year-old Muhammad, who has cerebral palsy and is lactose and gluten-intolerant and can only eat blended food, had great difficulties in securing food for him:

Most of his food should be fruit and vegetables, which is what I try to buy. But all I can find and afford are oranges. The problem is that he cannot chew, so we need to break down the food for him. Everything is very expensive.

Dr. Ahmed Shahin, a pediatrician, said that before he could leave Gaza on November 16, Osman, his 14-year-old son with cerebral palsy, who uses a gastrostomy feeding tube, had lost seven kilograms (about 15 pounds) since the beginning of the hostilities because they lacked access to both the specific food he needed—such as vegetables—and electricity to blend his food.

Obstacles to Aid Delivery

Ongoing Israeli bombardment and ground operations, lack of security assurances from Israel, widespread infrastructure damage, and communications disruptions make it difficult to distribute the little aid that does get into Gaza. Humanitarian organizations have reported that Israeli forces have attacked their aid convoys and workers. Israeli forces have also shot at and shelled people congregating to collect aid, killing and injuring hundreds.

An Israeli government spokesperson stated on March 18 that aid entering Gaza faced no limits apart from security concerns. Other officials have blamed the UN for distribution delays and accused Hamas of aid diversion or the Gaza police of failing to secure convoys. On March 29, the Israeli Defense Ministry’s body governing civilian affairs in the Palestinian territories, COGAT, disputed the March 18 UN-supported humanitarian report warning of an imminent famine, and said that it “does not reflect the full situation.” COGAT denied that the Israeli government was purposely starving Gaza’s civilian population. Human Rights Watch wrote to COGAT on April 2 seeking comment on our findings, but did not receive a response as of the time of publication.

However, OCHA reported on April 8 that only one of four food aid missions that require coordination in Gaza were facilitated by Israeli authorities in March. Only nine World Food Programme aid shipments have made it to the north since January 1, the most recent of which was 18 truckloads on March 17. The World Food Programme said at least 300 trucks are needed every day for the north alone.

The United States has resorted to airdropping food into Gaza and plans to build a floating pier at sea to deliver aid, a proposal criticized by 26 nongovernmental organizations, including Human Rights Watch, as “risky, expensive, and ineffective.” UN Humanitarian Coordinator Jamie McGoldrick has stressed that road transport is the only viable solution for increasing aid flow.

The restrictions on aid delivery make accessing food for people requiring a specific diet particularly difficult. Several representatives of humanitarian organizations said that they have been unable to provide food for children on special diets or to reach them. A Palestine Children’s Relief Fund staff member said they could only provide baby formula and could not respond to the needs of children with specific diet requirements. Medical Aid for Palestine said the special food items they had in storage ran out quickly, and since then, they have been unable to find and provide those in need with specialized food items:

Assistance is barely coming in: a quarter of the population is at risk of famine. Under these circumstances, people with disabilities and [people in vulnerable situations] suffer the most. When you speak about food, it’s hard to support people who need a specific diet and medical assistance.

India’s general elections are scheduled to begin on April 19, 2024, and last six weeks. The results are to be announced on June 4. Voters will elect 543 members for the lower house of Parliament for five-year terms. The party or coalition of parties that wins a majority of seats will nominate a candidate for prime minister and form a government.

What are India’s human rights obligations around the 2024 general elections?

India is subject to human rights obligations under international human rights treaties and customary law and is obligated to conduct elections fairly and freely, including by ensuring that citizens are able to vote without undue influence or coercion. In addition to ensuring the right to participate in public affairs, India is also obligated to secure other rights when it comes to elections. These include the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, association, and privacy; the right of people to run for public office with the freedom to convey their ideas; and the obligation to ensure that voters are able to vote free of abusive or manipulative interference.

India is party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, among other core human rights treaties.

What international human rights laws or standards apply to the use of technology in elections?

The United Nations Human Rights Council and General Assembly have recognized that human rights protections apply online. The UN Human Rights Committee, which monitors compliance with the ICCPR, has recognized that multiple human rights are engaged during elections, and are integral to the right to participate in public affairs. Governments should ensure that these rights are protected online and offline in the context of elections.

The UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression has highlighted internet shutdowns, initiatives to combat “fake news” and disinformation, attacks on election infrastructure, and interference with voter records and voters’ data as key technology-related threats to elections. Internet shutdowns are incompatible with international human rights law, and governments should refrain from imposing them. Restrictions on online advocacy of democratic values and human rights are never permissible under international standards.

The UN General Assembly has issued resolutions recognizing the important role that social media platforms can have during elections and expressed concern regarding the manipulative use of these platforms to spread disinformation, which can undermine informed decision-making by the electorate. The resolutions have also highlighted the growing prevalence of internet shutdowns as a means of disrupting access to online information during elections

Freedom of expression experts from the UN, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and the Organization of American States have also jointly denounced the adoption of general or ambiguous laws on false information, underscoring the increased likelihood that such laws will be misused to curtail rights during elections.

What role are online platforms expected to play in the Indian elections?

Technology is expected to play a significant role in India’s upcoming election. Indian political parties campaign extensively through digital platforms. Ahead of the upcoming elections, political advertising on Google surged in the first three months of 2024. The governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been the largest advertiser among political parties on both Google and Meta over the past three months and has built a massive messaging operation through WhatsApp. “Diffuse actors” with no institutional or organizational affiliations also play a significant, but less transparent, role in disseminating and amplifying political speech on social networks to mobilize voters in India.

As whistleblower reports have made clear, Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has been selective in curbing – and in some cases has amplified – hate speech, misinformation, and inflammatory posts, particularly anti-Muslim hate speech and misinformation, in India, which are likely to play a part in electoral campaigning. Networks of inauthentic accounts, some reported to be associated with government authorities, have also been shown to spread misinformation and hateful content.

The widespread availability of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools that are low-cost and require little technical expertise to use raises new challenges for India’s 2024 elections. India’s information technology minister, Ashwini Vaishnaw, called AI-generated audiovisual content a “threat to democracy.” In the context of elections, generative AI can be used to create deceptive videos, audio messages, and images impersonating a candidate, official, or media outlets that are then disseminated quickly across social media platforms, undermining the integrity of the election or inciting violence, hatred, or discrimination against religious minorities. In the lead-up to the 2024 elections, several parties are using AI in their campaigns.

What authority does the government have to block online content?

Indian authorities have exerted more control over online spaces to shut down criticism and dissent in recent years. They have banned at least 509 apps, according to media reports, including TikTok following escalating tensions with China.

The government’s legal authority for blocking the internet and other online content comes mainly from the Information Technology Act and related rules. Additionally, the Election Commission of India (ECI) forbids “any activity which may aggravate existing differences or create mutual hatred or cause tension between different castes and communities, religious or linguistic.”

Indian authorities have a history of applying these laws to block online content critical of the government. In February 2024, the authorities arbitrarily used their powers to block online content and accounts of its critics and journalists on social media platforms. For example, the Global Government Affairs team at X (formerly known as Twitter) stated that the Indian government issued “executive orders” requiring them to take down specific accounts on February 21. Most of these accounts belong to journalists who reported on peaceful protests held by farmers, farmers union leaders, and others supporting the farmers’ actions.

The IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 , ostensibly aimed at curbing misuse of social media, including to spread “fake news,” in fact enhance government control over online platforms. In April 2023, the government amended the 2021 IT rules, authorizing the authorities to set up a “fact checking” unit with arbitrary, overbroad, and unchecked censorship powers to order online intermediaries to take down content deemed false or misleading about “any business” of the government. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology established the fact-checking unit on March 20. However, the Supreme Court put the fact-checking unit on hold until the Bombay High Court decides its constitutionality.

The authorities frequently use internet shutdowns to stem political protests and criticism of the government or as a default policing action, violating domestic and international legal standards that require such shutdowns to further a legitimate aim, and to be necessary, proportionate, and lawful. Shutting down the internet ahead of or during elections risks accelerating the spread of electoral disinformation and incitement to violence, hatred, or discrimination, and it hinders the reporting of human rights violations.

Does the use of personal data in the context of the election pose risks?

Misuse of personal data is a major concern in India’s elections. Personal data can contain sensitive and revealing insights about people’s identity, age, religion, caste, location, behavior, associations, activities, and political beliefs.

India has developed an extensive digital public infrastructure through which Indians access social-protection programs. At the heart of this is “Aadhaar , ” the world’s largest biometric identity database, which is required to access all government programs. The Indian government has collected massive amounts of personal data in the absence of adequate data protection laws to properly protect privacy rights.

In August 2023, the Indian government adopted a personal data protection law, but it is not yet operational. The law fails to protect citizens from privacy violations, and instead grants the government sweeping powers to exempt itself from compliance, enabling unchecked data collection and state surveillance. In particular, large amounts of government-held personal data are being made available to the ruling BJP, which potentially allows the party to develop targeted campaigns before the 2024 general elections. Human Rights Watch has documented in other contexts that government authorities repurposed personal data collected for administration of public services to spread campaign messages, and further tilt an already uneven playing field in favor of the ruling party.

In recent years, there have been instances of Aadhaar data being made publicly available due to weak information security practices, which can have serious implications for privacy and misuse in the context of elections. For example, in 2019, the personal data of over 78 million residents in two Indian states was misused to build a mobile app for Telugu Desam Party, a regional political party with influence in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. This data reportedly included voters’ Aadhaar number, demographic details, party affiliation, and beneficiary details of government schemes, among other information.

Additionally, the Indian government has been proposing to link voter ID cards (and the voter database) with Aadhaar since 2015. In December 2021, Parliament passed the Election Laws Amendment Bill, which created a legal framework for integrating the two systems. However, civil society and experts warned that this could lead to voter fraud, disenfranchisement based on identity, targeted advertisements, and commercial exploitation of sensitive personal data.

In September 2023, the Election Commission of India (ECI) told the Supreme Court that it would clarify that the submission of Aadhaar numbers is not mandatory. However, by February 2023, The Hindu had reported that, according to the ECI, roughly 60 percent of voters had already linked their Aadhaar numbers to their voter IDs. Furthermore, voter registration forms lack a clear option for voters to abstain from providing their Aadhaar number.

There have already been reports of misuse of personal data in the campaign period that started on March 16. On March 21, the ECI told the government to stop sending messages promoting government policies to voters as it was a violation of the campaign guidelines. The message and accompanying letter from Prime Minister Narendra Modi that prompted the ECI intervention listed several government programs and sparked concerns over data privacy, as well as abuse of government communications for political purposes.

What responsibilities do tech companies have?

Under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, companies have a responsibility to respect human rights. This requires them to avoid causing or contributing to human rights impacts, remedy such impacts when they occur, and prevent or mitigate human rights risks linked to their operations. Specifically, companies need to identify human rights risks in their own operations, products, services, and business relationships; in consultation with rights groups, including human rights defenders and journalists at risk; and develop plans and processes to prevent and mitigate these risks.

In the context of elections, tech companies have the responsibility to conduct ongoing human rights due diligence, and to revisit existing due diligence measures to take into account the heightened risks to human rights that elections present. As part of this process, companies should address any aspects of their products, services, and business practices that may cause, contribute, or be linked with undermining free and fair elections, including threats to the right to vote or to participate freely in elections. The risks include the spread of electoral disinformation, manipulative interference with voters’ ability to form independent opinions, and spread of content that could incite hatred or violence.

Companies should clearly define what constitutes political advertising, so that it is clear to voters who is behind a particular campaign message, and put in place adequate measures to comply with campaign regulations. Actions that companies take should be in line with international human rights standards and conducted in a consistent, transparent, and accountable manner.

Companies should publish all available measures that the public can take to report electoral disinformation and content that could incite hatred or violence in all state languages, in multiple formats, including easy-to-access formats, to reach users across India, both literate and otherwise.

In 2019, the Election Commission of India and social media platforms created a Voluntary Code of Ethics for General Elections aimed to increase transparency in paid political advertising, bringing political ads on platforms like Facebook and Google under the purview of the campaign guidelines for parties and candidates. However, the code was drafted without transparency, public input, or civil society engagement. It lacks a clear definition of what constitutes “political advertising,” making detailed comparisons of political ad spending across different platforms difficult.

Additionally, there is no provision for monitoring by the Election Commission of India or an independent organization of the platforms’ compliance with the code. Guidance from the Electronics and Information Technology Ministry requires companies to label AI-generated content and inform users about the possible inherent fallibility or unreliability of the output generated by their AI tools.

Have social media companies met their human rights responsibilities in previous Indian elections?

Indian authorities have applied significant formal and informal pressure on tech companies, both to suppress critical speech and to keep online speech by government-aligned actors that would otherwise violate the companies’ policies.

In 2022, an in-depth investigation by the Reporters’ Collective and ad.watch of advertisements in India, spanning February 2019 to November 2020, raised questions about whether Facebook was giving the BJP cheaper ad rates compared with those offered to its opponents during 9 out of 10 elections analyzed. This study also found that Meta was allowing the BJP to create proxy advertisements, going against the company’s own rules. When Facebook did crack down on surrogate advertisements, it mostly targeted advertisers promoting the opposition Congress Party.

Collectively, such actions can have the effect of contributing to an uneven playing field by giving the BJP an unfair advantage in political campaigning online. In March 2022, Meta denied in broad terms accusations of favoring the BJP, and repeated previous statements that its policies apply uniformly “without regard to anyone’s political positions or party affiliations.”

Moreover, according to a report in the Washington Post based on an investigation by an outside law firm that Meta contracted in 2019, Meta did not stop hate speech and incitement of violence ahead of a riot in Delhi in 2020 in which at least 53 people died. In comments to the Post, Meta referenced its policies on hate speech and incitement, saying it enforced them globally, but Meta has refused to publish this human rights impact assessment, showing a continued disregard for the serious human rights concerns that civil society groups have been raising for years.

What are online platforms doing to protect human rights during the 2024 elections?

In response to public pressure, some platforms and messaging apps in recent years have announced steps they are taking to prepare for elections. Of the major tech companies, Google and Meta announced specific measures in preparation for India’s 2024 elections.

Meta said in March that it will activate an India-specific Elections Operations Center to bring together experts from across the company. The company says its efforts will center around combating misinformation and false news, addressing viral messaging on its subsidiary WhatsApp, making political advertising more transparent, combating election interference, and encouraging civic engagement.

Meta says it will remove AI-generated content that violates its policies, and that AI-generated content can also be reviewed and rated by fact-checking partners. Fact checkers can rate a piece of content as “Altered,” which includes “faked, manipulated or transformed audio, video, or photos.” Once content is labeled “altered” its distribution is limited. Meta is also requiring advertisers globally to disclose when they use AI or digital methods to create or alter a political or social issue ad in certain cases. However, relying on self-disclosure means that content, including images, videos, or audio recordings that is altered with AI, can spread before they are properly identified.

Meta announced in March that it had joined forces with the Misinformation Combat Alliance (MCA), a cross-industry alliance working to combat misinformation and fake news, to introduce a WhatsApp helpline to deal with AI-generated misinformation, especially synthetic media (AI-generated audio and visual content), creating an avenue for reporting and verifying suspicious media.

As part of this initiative, it is working with MCA to conduct training sessions for law enforcement officials and other stakeholders on advanced techniques for combating misinformation, including identifying synthetic audiovisual material. However, training law enforcement officials has significant limitations in India because of the long-pending reforms needed to separate law enforcement from political interference, and control to protect its independence.

Meta noted that it is closely engaged with the Election Commission of India via the 2019 Voluntary Code of Ethics, and gives the commission a high priority channel to flag unlawful content.

Google announced in March that it would elevate authoritative electoral information in searches and on its subsidiary YouTube, and provide transparency around election ads. The company said it would combat misinformation, including by working with fact-checkers and using AI models to fight abuse at scale. However automated content moderation often falls short by missing necessary context and nuance and is unlikely to capture all content, particularly in non-English and low-resource languages. Google also announced it has begun to roll out restrictions on the types of election-related queries for which its Gemini generative AI chatbot will return responses.

X has general policies around elections, but has not released specific information on its efforts around India’s election to inform citizens of measures they can take to safeguard their election rights, including reporting misinformation and manipulative use of AI. X’s general approach to elections focuses on elevating credible information, promoting safety on the platform, promoting transparency, and collaborating with partners. X’s policies state that it prohibits the use of its services for manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes.This includes posting or sharing content that may suppress participation or mislead people about when, where, or how to participate in a civic process.

Under the policies, X may label and reduce the visibility of posts containing false or misleading information about civic processes in order to provide additional context. Severe or repeated violations of this policy by specific accounts may lead to permanent suspension.

Some generative-AI-focused tech companies announced their approach to elections generally. The ChatGPT creator Open AI said in January 2024 that they “don’t allow people to build applications for political campaigning and lobbying” with their technology. However, analysis by the Washington Post in August 2023 showed that OpenAI was failing to implement its March 2023 policy for prohibiting political messaging on its products. The Post noted that an OpenAI representative told them the company was “exploring tools to detect when people are using ChatGPT to generate campaign materials,” and that its rules reflected an evolution in how the company thinks about politics and elections.

Anthropic, an AI company, similarly state d that, effective September 15, 2023, its generative AI products should not be used for political campaigning and lobbying, and said in February that it was using technical evaluations to detect potential “election misuses,” including when systems deliver misinformation and bias.

Stability AI, a generative AI company, also has an “Acceptable Use Policy” that asks users not to use its technology to violate the law or others’ rights, impersonate another individual, or generate or promote disinformation. AI-generated audio can be harder to identify than visual content for fact-checkers. The audio generator developer Eleven Labs has stated it aims to prevent mimicking prominent politicians’ voices using its technology. Though it is focusing first on the US and UK, it says it is “working to expand this safeguard to other languages and election cycles.”

In February, companies that create or disseminate AI-generated content initiated the “Tech Accord to Combat Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections,” a set of voluntary commitments to manage the risks globally arising from deceptive AI election content. However, voluntary commitments are a floor, not a ceiling , and lack enforcement mechanisms needed for genuine accountability.

Digital rights organizations have called on the Election Commission of India to take urgent measures on generative AI and manipulated media content to uphold electoral integrity.

What else should tech companies be doing to respect the right to participate in the elections?

India presents a challenging environment for social media platforms and messaging apps, so companies need to urgently adopt effective steps to respect human rights in India. They should make the human rights of people in India a priority, including at the expense of profits. This means treating all parties and candidates equitably, and not bending to central government pressure or giving government or the ruling BJP special allowances, especially when it comes to spreading speech that incites violence or hatred.

Despite the 2021 IT Rules, and other restrictive legislation in India, companies should continue to resist pressure from the authorities when responding to requests to remove content or provide access to data. This is particularly important for content shared by civil society groups, which is crucial for election monitoring and the removal or blocking of which might have an adverse impact on election results.

Companies should also be transparent regarding data access requests and government takedowns, including by linking to the Lumen database, a Harvard University hosted database of takedown notices and other legal removal requests and demands; and reporting how they responded, whether the response consisted of proactively reporting a violation to law enforcement, or any other steps taken in compliance with Indian law.

Companies that provide the tools that generate AI images, videos, audio products, and text should demonstrate that they have thought through how their tools can be used and abused in the context of India’s elections and specifically outline how they will mitigate those risks, in consultation with human rights and technology experts.

Ahead of elections, and in between election cycles, companies should demonstrate that they have adequately invested in responsible moderation, both human and automated; as well as carry out rigorous human rights impact assessments for product and policy development, engage in ongoing assessment and reassessment, and consult with civil society in a meaningful way.",HIGH,20240409T040000Z,Human Rights Organizations,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Election Commission of India, Tech companies (Meta, Google, etc.)",Government of India and Tech Companies,India,"Implement rigorous oversight of tech companies, Strengthen data protection laws, Ensure transparency in political advertising.",Manipulation of electoral integrity through technology and suppression of dissent,India,"Political manipulation, Government control over online spaces, Inadequate data protection laws"

(Bangkok) – The Myanmar military has abducted and forcibly recruited more than 1,000 Rohingya Muslim men and boys from across Rakhine State since February 2024, Human Rights Watch said today. The junta is using a conscription law that only applies to Myanmar citizens, although the Rohingya have long been denied citizenship under the 1982 Citizenship Law.

Rohingya described being picked up in nighttime raids, coerced with false promises of citizenship, and threatened with arrest, abduction, and beatings. The military has been sending Rohingya to abusive training for two weeks, then deploying them. Many have been sent to the front lines in the surging fighting between the junta and the Arakan Army armed group, which broke out in Rakhine State in November 2023, and a number have been killed and injured.

“It’s appalling to see Myanmar’s military, which has committed atrocities against the Rohingya for decades while denying them citizenship, now forcing them to fight on its behalf,” said Shayna Bauchner, Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The junta should immediately end this forced recruitment and permit Rohingya unlawfully conscripted to return home.”

Human Rights Watch documented 11 cases of forced recruitment, drawing on interviews with 25 Rohingya from Sittwe, Maungdaw, Buthidaung, Pauktaw, and Kyauktaw townships in Rakhine State and in Bangladesh.

On February 10, the military activated the 2010 People’s Military Service Law, enabling the conscription of men ages 18 to 35 and women ages 18 to 27 for up to five years during the current state of emergency. The announcement followed months of increased fighting with ethnic armed groups and resistance forces.

The junta announced that conscription would start in April, with a monthly quota of 5,000, but the authorities in Rakhine State began forcibly recruiting Rohingya in early February.

In late February, the military abducted over 150 Rohingya in raids on villages in Buthidaung township, according to people interviewed, Rohingya activists, and media reports. A 22-year-old Rohingya man said that light infantry battalion soldiers abducted him and 30 other young men and boys at gunpoint at about 11 p.m. on February 25 in Buthidaung town.

“The youngest boy taken away with us was 15 years old,” he said. “There were three recruits under 18 among us. After we were apprehended and taken to the military battalion, we saw the list of Rohingya who were going to be recruited. All the Rohingya youths in the region were included.”

Further raids took place in Maungdaw township in March. A 24-year-old Rohingya man who was abducted with about two dozen others from Ka Nyin Tan village said the officers told them, “Protecting Maungdaw is upon you.”

An estimated 630,000 Rohingya remain in Rakhine State under a system of apartheid and persecution, including about 150,000 held in open-air detention camps. Since the February 2021 military coup, the junta has imposed severe movement restrictions and aid blockages on the Rohingya, increasing their vulnerability to forced recruitment.

Rohingya camp management committee members said that junta authorities have been tallying “eligible” Rohingya or compelling the committees to make lists. Two members said when they tried to refuse, junta authorities further restricted movement in the camps and threatened mass arrests and ration cuts. “We had no other option,” one committee member said.

At meetings in camps in Sittwe and Kyaukpyu, junta officials promised to issue all forced recruits pink citizenship cards, reserved for “full” citizens. “In the meetings, officers picked up their citizenship cards and told people, ‘We will give you this type of ID card if you join the military service,’” a camp management committee member in Thet Kae Pyin camp said. “People believed them.” Authorities also promised 4,800 kyat (US$2.30) a day and two sacks of rice.

About 300 Rohingya from the Sittwe camps were sent to two weeks of military training in late February. Upon completion, the military gave the forced recruits 50,000 kyats ($24) but no citizenship cards. “When the junta broke their promise to issue citizenship cards to the first 300 Rohingya recruits, people stopped believing them and started avoiding the recruitment campaigns,” a camp management committee member said. Rohingya in the Sittwe camps said that for the second round of forced recruitment, the few hundred Rohingya were taken at gunpoint in raids.

Officials have also threatened to beat Rohingya to death if they refuse to join or to punish their families if they fled.

Many young Rohingya men have tried to escape Rakhine State or gone into hiding in the jungle to escape forced recruitment. The authorities rounded up and beat about 40 Rohingya from Kyauk Ta Lone camp when their family members ran away, according to Radio Free Asia.

The 22-year-old man described the military training as a brutal two-week period under constant harassment, with trainees forced to dig bunkers and split wood, with limited food and water. “We became weak within a few days,” he said. “Some recruits fell unconscious. Three of us were bleeding from our mouths and noses. The military officers used abusive language, called us ‘kalar’ [a slur for Muslims], and degraded our mothers and sisters. Those 12 days felt like 12 years of our lives.”

He witnessed numerous groups of forcibly recruited Rohingya arriving at the cantonment. He was ultimately able to escape, the only one from his ward to do so: “Of us 31, no one else has been released to this day.”

The forcible recruitment campaign has already resulted in casualties. After their training, 100 Rohingya from the Sittwe camps were sent to fight on the front lines in Rathedaung. Five were killed in fighting and 10 were seriously injured, one of whom later died, according to family members and camp leaders. The military authorities promised the families compensation of a million kyat ($476) and two sacks of rice. The five bodies have not been returned.

While 43 forced recruits later returned to the camps, there has been no news from the remainder. “We still don’t know their whereabouts,” a camp leader said. “We don’t know if they’re still alive.”

“They tricked my son into the military,” said the mother of a man who was killed. She said:

They took him to do electrical work, then forced him into the training. Now he’s dead because he was sent to war. They didn’t let us see the bodies. I couldn’t touch my son one last time. When he was taken away, his wife and I followed. He was held at a nearby cantonment for a few hours and we were able to talk to him from outside the fence. Then they were brought to a car. That was the last talk. He was crying.

Conscription without previous legal authorization is a form of arbitrary detention in violation of international human rights law, and the treatment of those forcibly recruited may amount to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict, which Myanmar ratified in September 2019, prohibits the forced recruitment, conscription, or use of anyone under 18 in armed conflict.

On March 18, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres expressed his concern about “reports of forcible detention and recruitment of youths, including Rohingya, and the potential impact of forced conscription on human rights and on the social fabric of communities in Myanmar.”

“The Myanmar military’s forced recruitment of Rohingya men and boys is its latest exploitation of a community made vulnerable to abuse by design, over decades of oppression,” Bauchner said. “Concerned governments should be strengthening avenues to justice to hold junta leaders accountable for their abuses, past and present.”",HIGH,20240410T024500Z,Human Rights Watch,Shayna Bauchner (Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch),Myanmar military,"Rakhine State, Myanmar","Strengthening avenues for justice against junta leaders, ending forced recruitment of Rohingya.",Forcibly recruiting and abducting Rohingya Muslim men and boys,Myanmar,Long-standing denial of citizenship and systemic oppression of Rohingya

(Bangkok) – The Thai government’s decision not to forcibly return 19 children to Myanmar should be expanded to include all refugees from Myanmar, Human Rights Watch said today.

On March 12, 2024, officials from Thai immigration and the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security took 19 Myanmar children, ages 5 to 17, from Wat Sawang Arom School in Lopburi province in central Thailand and brought them without their parents to the border in Chiang Rai province prior to repatriating them to Myanmar. Thai members of parliament, human rights groups, and the National Human Rights Commission of Thailand strongly criticized the planned return. On March 26, Social Development and Human Security Minister Varawut Silpa-archa said in a media interview that his agency would not return the 19 children to Myanmar, and that they could remain in Thailand.

“Thai authorities showed sympathy and support by allowing 19 children from Myanmar to remain in Thailand,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The government’s next step should be to assure all those fleeing Myanmar that they can seek protection in Thailand.”

Prior to Varawut’s announcement, Thai officials had said that the 19 children were “undocumented” and were irregularly living in Thailand. The previous government in July 2023 had used a similar argument to justify sending back 126 “undocumented” Myanmar children from a school in Ang Thong province, despite concerns raised by the National Human Rights Commission of Thailand and human rights groups.

Varawut’s assurances that these 19 children could remain in Thailand should become Thai government policy for all Myanmar refugees, as long as the human rights situation in Myanmar remains dire, Human Rights Watch said. Fighting since early April around the Myanmar border town of Myawaddy, opposite Mae Sot in Thailand’s Tak province, has raised concerns about future influxes of refugees.

Thai Foreign Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara said on April 9 that the government has prepared to receive up to 100,000 refugees temporarily.

Not everyone fleeing conflict and rights abuses in Myanmar has been able to seek protection in Thailand. In late October, the Thai military forcibly returned thousands of refugees who had been sheltering in border areas next to Myanmar’s Karenni State.

Any forced returns to Myanmar may violate Thailand’s obligations as a party to the Convention Against Torture and the customary international law principle prohibiting refoulement, the forcible return of anyone to a place where they would face a genuine risk of persecution, torture or other ill-treatment, or a threat to their life.

Since the February 2021 coup, Myanmar’s military junta has carried out a nationwide campaign of mass killings, torture, arbitrary arrests, and indiscriminate attacks that amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes. More than two million people have been internally displaced and more than 109,000 refugees have fled to neighboring countries.

The Thai government should promptly fulfill its pledge at the Global Refugee Forum in December 2023 to withdraw its reservation to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Article 22 guarantees the rights of refugee children, but Thailand’s reservation calls for refugee children to be treated “subject to the national laws, regulations and prevailing practices in Thailand.” The convention also contains protections for children from being forcibly separated from their parents.

Thailand should also provide protection and support to all refugees, including by permitting the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, to undertake refugee status determinations.

“The deteriorating human rights situation in Myanmar could mean that Thailand receives many more refugees in the near future,” Pearson said. “While the Thai government should be assuring refugees that they will not be returned into harm’s way, concerned governments should be prepared to support Thailand to provide protection.”",HIGH,20240411T030000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Elaine Pearson, Varawut Silpa-archa, Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara",Thai government,"Wat Sawang Arom School, Lopburi province; border in Chiang Rai province; areas near Myanmar’s Karenni State","Thai government should maintain protections for all refugees, fulfill obligations under international law, support UN refugee agency access.",Forcibly returning refugees to Myanmar despite human rights concerns,Thailand,"Coup in Myanmar, ongoing conflict and human rights abuses in Myanmar"

In early February, a 30-year-old Jewish student was hospitalized following an attack by a fellow student at Berlin’s largest public university, Freie Universität Berlin.

Berlin’s authorities treated the attack as politically motivated antisemitic violence and attributed it to the impact in Europe of the escalation in the Israel-Palestine conflict. In response to the attack, Germany’s antisemitism commissioner demanded a clear stance against antisemitism from the university leadership.

Berlin has a dedicated general commissioner on antisemitism at the state level as well as within its state police and prosecution office, with the latter two focused on the criminal justice response to antisemitism. They are in regular contact with Jewish communities and groups.

In March, Human Rights Watch met with Winfrid Wenzel, antisemitism commissioner for the Berlin Police Department. His role is to liaise with police officers to ensure effective recognition and recording of antisemitic crimes. He also works to build trust among Jewish communities in the police force.

Wenzel shared information showing that in 2023, police recorded 72 acts of antisemitic violence in Berlin. The frequency of antisemitic violence suggests policing can’t be the sole answer to hate crimes.

International guidelines have demonstrated the critical role education plays in countering the bias and prejudice that underlies antisemitism. The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance highlights the need for educational institutions to be equipped to respond effectively to antisemitic attacks and promote an understanding of antisemitism among students. The German government’s Strategy against Antisemitism and for Jewish Life also highlighted education as a “lifelong goal” to prevent antisemitism.

Last month, Berlin’s state government reacted to the violence, threats, and intimidation faced by Jewish students on campuses with assurances that it was in “intense communication” with universities to guarantee the safety of Jewish students. As of April 1, when the new semester began, universities in Berlin have been asked to strengthen their security protocols relating to antisemitic incidents to ensure students are better supported.

Freie Universität Berlin decided to ban the alleged perpetrator of the attack from campus for a preliminary three-month period; but there is broader work that must be done by German universities to build trust among Jewish students and assure them of their safety. In addition to appointing a contact person on antisemitism, universities should actively raise awareness about antisemitism and other forms of discrimination on campus and create inclusive and open platforms for dialogue and mutual learning.",HIGH,20240412T111500Z,Jewish community,"Winfrid Wenzel, antisemitism commissioner",Fellow student,Freie Universität Berlin,"Strengthening security protocols, raising awareness, creating inclusive platforms",Antisemitic attack,Germany,Escalation in the Israel-Palestine conflict

Belarus has hit a new low in its targeting of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. As of today, the definition of pornography under Belarusian law will include depictions of same-sex relationships as well as transgender people.

The Culture Ministry recently amended its decree on “erotic materials” to classify “homosexualism, lesbian love” and the “desire to live and be seen by others as a person of an opposite sex”—a reference to transgender people—as “non-traditional sexual relationship or behavior.” This places depictions of LGBT people alongside those of necrophilia, pedophilia, and voyeurism, all of which legally constitute “non-traditional relationships.”

Under Belarusian law, they all may also constitute pornography.

Public displays of pornography are punishable in Belarus with up to four years in prison. Child pornography is punishable with up to 13 years behind bars.

While it is not yet clear what kinds of depictions of LGBT people could fall under the new definition of pornography, it clearly aims to assault the dignity of sexual and gender minorities, people already demonized and at risk of persecution in Belarus.

Belarusian public officials and religious groups periodically advocate for introducing administrative and criminal liability for “non-traditional sexual relationship and gender change propaganda.” Neighboring Russia recently expanded its anti-gay propaganda law and banned the “international LGBT movement” as extremist.

In 2020, police arrested numerous peaceful protesters who demonstrated against the rigged presidential elections. Belarusian rights groups documented the systematic and widespread ill-treatment and torture of the protesters, reporting that people perceived as LGBT faced an increased risk of police violence and threats of sexualized violence.

Since then, Belarusian authorities have used public humiliation as a shaming tool against critics who are perceived to be or are LGBT. In one such instance, police forced a detainee, arrested for leaving a critical comment online, to “confess” on camera to being gay. At the end of the horrific video, he said: “I understand this is immoral, I promise to correct it.”

In their brutal assault against civil society in recent years, Belarusian authorities shut down all human rights organizations, including LGBT rights groups, leaving LGBT people with even less protection.

(Nairobi) – As global and regional leaders meet in Paris to spotlight Sudan and mark the one-year anniversary of the country’s brutal conflict between Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF), they should make clear that those responsible for ongoing atrocities and other violations of international humanitarian law will be held to account, Human Rights Watch said today. This includes widespread intentional killings of civilians, unlawful attacks on civilian infrastructure, as well as the deliberate looting of aid, which constitute war crimes.



On April 15, France alongside Germany and the European Union are cohosting a conference on Sudan to press for an end to the fighting and for a significant uptick in global funding for the grossly under-resourced response as a hunger and broader humanitarian crisis unravels in the country and in refugee hosting countries.



“The warring parties in Sudan have inflicted tremendous suffering on Sudanese from all walks of life. The global response to Sudan’s brutal conflict needs to change,” said Mohamed Osman, Sudan researcher at Human Rights Watch.“Leaders meeting in Paris should act to tackle the shamefully low levels of humanitarian funding, including for local responders, and commit to concrete measures against those deliberately hampering aid delivery to populations in need.”



The conference comes a year after conflict broke out between the SAF and RSF in Khartoum on April 15, 2023, before spreading to other regions including Darfur and central Sudan. Despite the magnitude of suffering and violations by the warring parties, the situation in Sudan has received an underwhelming response from the international community.



Almost 15,000 people are known to have been killed since then, almost certainly an underestimate. The conflict has uprooted 8.5 million people, most internally, making Sudan the world’s largest internal displacement crisis. Around 1.76 million people have fled into neighboring countries.Without significant humanitarian assistance, five million people could risk starvation in the coming months.



Both warring parties have committed serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, amounting in some cases to war crimes and other atrocity crimes, Human Rights Watch said. The SAF have unlawfully killed civilians, carried out airstrikes that have deliberately targeted civilian infrastructure, and repeatedly obstructed humanitarian aid among other violations. The RSF has carried out widespread civilian killings, many of which appear to be ethnically targeted notably in West Darfur, while also hampering aid including by widespread looting of humanitarian supplies. They have used heavy explosive weapons in densely populated areas and engaged in widespread sexual violence and pillage. Both forces and their allies have recruited children and arbitrarily detained civilians.



According to the UN, approximately 25 million people, around half of the population, are now dependent on emergency food supplies, which SAF has deliberately restricted and RSF looted, in clear violation of international law, and in acts that could amount to war crimes, Human Rights Watch said.



Human Rights Watch interviews with aid workers described how authorities affiliated with SAF including its military intelligence have imposed a multitude of arbitrary bureaucratic restrictions that have hampered the work of humanitarian organizations and their ability to reach those in need. These include delays, denials, and nonresponse to requests for visas and travel permits, which the authorities require for aid personnel to move between federal states, as well as the imposition of excessive administrative procedures for importing and transporting relief materials. SAF’s unlawful obstruction of aid follows decades of hostility and routine obstruction towards international relief agencies under Sudan’s former President Omar al-Bashir, adding to the suffering of populations in conflict areas.



Rapid Support Forces and allied militias have repeatedly attacked and looted aid supplies and humanitarian infrastructure notably warehouses, such as the stocks in a World Food Programme (WFP) warehouse in Wad Madani in December 2023. “This attack – in areas controlled by the Rapid Support Forces – affected supplies that could have fed 1.5 million acutely food-insecure people for one whole month,” the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said. Communities in Darfur have also more recently accused the RSF of looting food supplies destined for displaced persons camps. The Darfur Network for Human Rights (DNHR), a rights monitoring group, said in an April 3 statement that RSF and Arab fighters looted aid supplies including food items for malnourished children from residents of an IDP camp in central Darfur.



Both parties, particularly SAF, have sought to restrict aid going to and through the opposing parties’ areas of control, which has put Khartoum under a de facto blockade since late 2023 and also hampered aid access in Darfur.



A local responder from Bahri city in Khartoum, said: “SAF is preventing any supplies entering the city and RSF is restricting movements within. We are forced to smuggle goods in including food, increasing prices of commodities as a result.”



WFP said on April 3 that it had managed to reach the Karrari locality in Omdurman, which is currently under SAF control, for the first time since December.



On March 6, Sudanese authorities informed the UN that they would only allow cross-border movement through specific crossings under the control of forces allied to the military, adding more financial and logistical challenges for humanitarian organizations.



On March 21, the RSF had released a statement on their official X (formerly known as Twitter) account saying they would not allow aid from Port Sudan to reach El Fashir, the capital of North Darfur, saying this plan will be used for rearmament purposes by SAF and their allies.



Warring parties killed, injured, and detained dozens of aid workers and targeted humanitarian convoys. In December, SAF attacked a convoy from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which included civilians to be evacuated, killing two people and injuring seven including three ICRC staff. SAF said following the incident that ICRC had diverted from the agreed route and that they were escorted by RSF vehicles.



Given the blocks on the international aid response, Sudanese responders, many of whom volunteer in the country’s emergency rooms, have borne the brunt of seeking to meet civilians’ growing needs in Khartoum, Darfur, Al Gezira, and elsewhere. Both sides in the conflict have harassed, detained, and otherwise abused local responders. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said in February said that both SAF and RSF were arbitrarily detaining thousands of civilians and had subjected hundreds to enforced disappearances including members of the emergency response rooms. Human Rights Watch has also documented RSF and SAF arbitrary arrests and mistreatment of emergency responders and healthcare workers in Khartoum.



The warring parties’ blatant disregard for international humanitarian and human rights law has caused the current humanitarian nightmare and left civilians in areas hit particularly hard by the fighting, notably Khartoum and its sister cities and large parts of Darfur, reeling and unable to access basic necessities.



Warring parties’ attacks, including of infrastructure such as healthcare facilities and water treatment plants, have made civilian lives precarious and insecure. Since the conflict’s onset, SAF forces have bombed and both parties have shelled health facilities, while the RSF has repeatedly occupied hospitals. The attacks on healthcare, many deliberate, have left 70-80 percent of healthcare facilities non-functional notably in Khartoum and Darfur. Even those deemed functional face massive challenges, due to lack of electricity, staffing and medical supplies including life-saving medication. “We cannot say there is a functioning health sector,” an international healthcare worker told Human Rights Watch in February. Warring parties’ relentless fighting in residential areas of Greater Khartoum, including using weaponry that frequently results in indiscriminate attacks in violation of the laws of war, over the course of the last year has also prevented the safe movement of civilians and local responders.



In May 2023, both parties committed to uphold international humanitarian law and allow aid delivery during talks hosted in Jeddah by Saudi Arabia and the United States and later joined by the African Union and the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD). With reports of a resumption of the Jeddah talks, the hosts should press for the establishment of a mechanism that will monitor implementation of the commitments to uphold international humanitarian and human rights law and protect civilians, including calling out attacks on and deliberate obstruction of humanitarian assistance and unlawful destruction of civilian infrastructure.



UN Security Council and African Union Peace and Security Council member states should maintain scrutiny over the food security situation, by holding regular public briefings over the next six months.



The United States, United Kingdom, and European Union and other countries should coordinate action under their respective sanction regimes on Sudan and urgently designate entities and individuals responsible for aid obstruction and other grave violations.



Governments meeting in Paris should also actively and publicly support efforts to investigate ongoing abuses on the ground, Human Rights Watch said. The office of the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) announced in July 2023 that it is investigating recent crimes committed in Darfur as part of his office’s ongoing Darfur investigations. The independent international fact-finding mission on Sudan, established by the UN Human Rights Council in October, and mandated to investigate violations across Sudan, including in Khartoum and Darfur, should be given full support and access, and be renewed as needed until investigations are complete.



“The world should be ashamed by the horrific cost of its inaction. Civilians in Sudan deserve to see a robust, concerted global response,” said Osman. “The Paris conference should not be where the focus on Sudan ends, but rather jumpstart a new approach, announcing major increases in humanitarian funding, including for local responders, and spelling out clear benchmarks and concrete measures states will take to end the weaponization of aid by both warring parties.”",VERY HIGH,20240413T054500Z,Human Rights Watch,Mohamed Osman (Sudan researcher at Human Rights Watch),Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF),"Khartoum, Darfur, and other regions in Sudan","Increase humanitarian funding, support local responders, commit to accountability measures for war crimes.","Widespread intentional killings of civilians, unlawful attacks on civilian infrastructure, deliberate looting of aid, which constitute war crimes.",Sudan,"Conflict between SAF and RSF, long-standing humanitarian issues, changes in government"

(Geneva) – United Nations member countries should use the upcoming review of Vietnam’s rights record at the UN Human Rights Council to press the government to end its crackdown on dissent and other fundamental rights, Human Rights Watch said in its submission to the UN. Vietnam’s Universal Periodic Review (UPR) will take place on May 7, 2024, in Geneva.

The Vietnamese government’s human rights record has worsened significantly since its last appearance periodic review in January 2019. In February, the government, which has criticized the UPR process as “unobjective,” submitted its own human rights report to the Human Rights Council.

“Governments at the UN Human Rights Council should not be swayed by the Vietnamese government’s attempt to whitewash its appalling human rights record,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “UN member countries should use Vietnam’s review to call out the government’s systematic repression of civil and political rights and demand genuine reforms.”

The Vietnamese government’s UN submission is riddled with falsehoods about the rights to freedom of speech and media freedom in the country, Human Rights Watch said. More than 160 people are currently imprisoned in Vietnam for criticizing the government, which the penal code criminalizes. All media are under the control of the Vietnamese Communist Party and Vietnam is the world’s third largest jailer of journalists. The authorities carry out intrusive surveillance of the internet, and posting or sharing criticism of the government online could lead to a long prison sentence.

Between January 2019 and August 2023, the Vietnamese authorities prosecuted and convicted at least 139 people, for criticizing the government or joining pro-democracy groups, all of whom were sentenced to long prison terms. Among them was the prominent blogger Pham Doan Trang, who on May 16 will receive the 2024 PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write Award.

Since August 2023 the authorities have imprisoned an additional 23 people for peacefully exercising their basic civil and political rights, and sentenced them to between 9 months and 13 years in prison. During the first four months of 2024, the police arrested at least 11 people on politically motivated charges, including the prominent rights activists Nguyen Chi Tuyen and Nguyen Vu Binh, and the religious freedom campaigners Thach Chanh Da Ra and Kim Khiem.

People arrested on politically motivated charges face months in pretrial detention without access to lawyers. The authorities may not even allow family members to be present at trials. The trials of rights activists last only a few hours, leaving no time for a genuine defense or cross-examination of evidence. Vietnam has no presumption of innocence or fair trial rights.

Despite government claims to the contrary, the authorities frequently hold “mobile trials,” informal courts in public spaces, to shame defendants and their families even before conviction. Between 2019 and 2023, Vietnam carried out mobile trials in at least 55 of its 58 provinces and the major cities of Hanoi, Hai Phong, Can Tho, Ho Chi Minh City, and Da Nang. During the first four months of 2024 alone, mobile trials took place in at least 39 provinces and all five cities.

On January 16, a court in Dak Lak began a mobile trial against 100 defendants who were accused of terrorism in a violent attack on government offices that caused nine deaths in June 2023. On January 20, the court convicted and sentenced all 100 to terms ranging from nine months to life in prison, with each defendant’s hearing lasting less than 24 minutes.

The right to religious freedom is also sharply controlled, Human Rights Watch said. All religious organizations allowed to operate must be officially recognized by the state and under the management of state-approved boards. Religious groups not recognized by the government are labeled “evil religions.”

Unrecognized independent religious groups face constant surveillance, harassment, and intimidation, and their followers are subject to public criticism, forced renunciation of faith, arbitrary detention, abusive interrogation, torture, and imprisonment.

In December 2023, Y Bum Bya, 49, from Dak Lak province, reported that he had been detained, interrogated, and beaten by the police for being affiliated with the Central Highlands Evangelical Church of Christ, a religious group that the government has labeled “reactionary.” He was also publicly criticized and forced to renounce his faith on television. On March 8, he allegedly received a phone call from the police and then went out. An hour later, he was found dead, hanging in a local cemetery. As far as Human Rights Watch has been able to determine, officials are not investigating his death.

“Case after case of abuse is why concerned countries should speak out about Hanoi’s terrible human rights record,” Pearson said. “UN member countries should not only press Vietnam at its UN review for real change but follow up to ensure that reforms are actually being undertaken.”",VERY HIGH,20240422T073000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Tran Huynh Duy Thuc, Hoang Duc Binh, Dinh Van Hai, Nguyen Tuong Thuy, Pham Doan Trang, Le Trong Hung, Pham Chi Thanh, Pham Chi Dung, Nguyen Lan Thang, Can Thi Theu, Dang Dinh Bach, Hoang Thi Minh Hong, Nguyen Chi Tuyen, Nguyen Vu Binh, Thach Chanh Da Ra, Kim Khiem, Y Bum Bya",Vietnamese government,Various locations in Vietnam including major cities and provinces,"UN member countries should call for an end to repression, promote genuine reforms and human rights for all.",Systematic repression of civil and political rights,Vietnam,"Government censorship, lack of political pluralism, repression of dissent"

Muhammad Boota, a domestic worker in Lahore, requires an insulin injection every 10 days to help manage his diabetes. But just one of these injections costs about one-third of his meagre monthly salary.

As with millions of Pakistanis with health conditions, the only thing that keeps food on his table and a roof over his head is unreliable charitable assistance to help pay for an unaffordable medicine that he cannot live without. His story is just one of so many examples of Pakistan’s severe healthcare crisis and one of so many reasons why the government needs to change course to ensure every Pakistani’s human right to the highest attainable standard of health.

According to the Pakistani nongovernmental healthcare organization, Sehat Kahani, more than 50 per cent of Pakistanis do not have access to basic primary healthcare services, and approximately 42 per cent have no access to health coverage. But recent government policy changes will most likely make this worse. In February, the cabinet increased the prices of 146 essential medicines, placing many of them even further out of the reach of people with lower incomes.

One key reason for the abysmal state of health care in Pakistan is the lack of government funding. According to 2021 figures, Pakistan’s government spends the equivalent of only 0.84 per cent of its GDP on healthcare – down from 0.94 per cent in 2019 and less than one-third of the average among other lower-middle-income countries (2.62 per cent). While public healthcare spending is not a sufficient condition for ensuring the right to health, adequate spending is a necessary one.

In its recent report, 'Global Failures on Healthcare Funding', Human Rights Watch analyzed 20 years of global healthcare expenditure data from the World Health Organization (WHO), looking at global and national trends. The researchers focused on how much both governments and private households spend on healthcare, the impact of out-of-pocket spending on the right to health, and how countries can shift this balance to improve access to healthcare through increased funding.

The Human Rights Watch analysis shows that in 2021, the most recent year for which data is available, most governments did not spend more than 5.0 per cent of their GDP or 15 per cent of their national budget on healthcare. These are two important and common benchmarks for assessing whether countries are on track to ensure universal health coverage, a goal distinct from but grounded in the human right to universally accessible health care derived from the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.

While the world lagged behind these important spending targets, Pakistan lagged even further. In 2021, out of 189 countries, Pakistan came in at number 176 on the amount of money the government spent on healthcare when measured relative to the size of its economy, and 170 when measured relative to the size of its national budget. Put simply, the government has not made funding healthcare a priority.

Many countries that spent the most on healthcare that year were high-income countries. But many governments from less wealthy countries prioritized funding healthcare. Cuba, for example, reported spending the equivalent of 12.6 per cent of its GDP on healthcare in 2021. Bolivia, a lower-middle-income country like Pakistan, met both spending benchmarks in 2021.

When governments do not fund healthcare, individuals and households are left to shoulder the burden. In 2021, more than 57 per cent of Pakistan’s healthcare spending was borne by patients and families through out-of-pocket costs like Boota’s insulin bill. Reliance on out-of-pocket payments can increase inequalities in healthcare, widening gaps in quality of life and life expectancy instead of ensuring the availability, accessibility, and quality of healthcare.

Pakistan’s present healthcare crisis is situated in a larger context of soaring poverty, inflation, and unemployment, as the country faces one of the worst economic crises in its history. The situation is jeopardizing millions of people’s human rights, including their rights to health, food, and housing.

But at least a quarter of Pakistan’s population was living below the national poverty line well before this crisis. The World Food Programme estimated that in 2018, 21 per cent of Pakistan’s population was undernourished and 44 per cent of children under the age of five had stunted growth. The Asian Development Bank reported that for every 1,000 children born in Pakistan in 2020, 65 would die before their fifth birthday. Almost 25 per cent of the population did not have access to electricity in 2020.

Pakistan is also among the countries most vulnerable to climate change. It faces rates of warming considerably above the global average and most likely more frequent and intense extreme climate events. These events are particularly threatening for economically and socially marginalized populations, including older people, people with disabilities, and people living in poverty and rural areas.

The Pakistani government has begun the latest round of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over a multi-billion-dollar, three-year programme to ward off an economic meltdown. Acute shortages of foreign currency last year meant that many imports, including essential medicines, were scarce or unobtainable.

Servicing debt is a major impediment to governments’ investment in health care. Human Rights Watch found that Pakistan paid about seven times more per person to service its external public debts than it did on health care in 2021. The IMF and credit ratings agencies estimate that interest payments on its debt will consume between 50-60 per cent of the government's revenues this year – the worst ratio of any comparable economy in the world.

Creditor governments and institutions such as the IMF should assess the impact of debt payments on the ability of governments to meet their human rights obligations, including the right to health, and consider debt restructuring or relief to ensure that countries such as Pakistan can adequately protect their rights.

But funding alone is not enough. Pakistan’s lack of investment in healthcare mirrors a lack of political will by the authorities to address the issue. Pakistan does not have a constitutionally protected right to healthcare. The country's constitution mentions that the state shall provide “medical relief” in its “Principles of Policy” chapter, but these principles are unenforceable, aspirational objectives. Even the “medical relief” objective is restricted to citizens who cannot earn a living because of infirmity, sickness, or unemployment.

Pakistan should urgently recognize the right to healthcare in line with international standards. The country's authorities need to realize that upholding the right to health for its people is not optional.",HIGH,20240422T073000Z,Human Rights Watch,Muhammad Boota,Pakistani government,Pakistan,"Recognize healthcare as a human right, increase healthcare funding, ensure access to essential medications.",Failure to provide adequate healthcare funding and services,Pakistan,"Lack of government funding, rising poverty, inflation, external debt obligations"

(Beirut) – Iran's security forces raped, tortured, and sexually assaulted detainees while repressing widespread protests in 2022 and 2023, Human Rights Watch said today. The grave abuses are part of a broader pattern of serious human rights violations to repress dissent.

Human Rights Watch investigated abuses against ten detained people from Kurdish, Baluch, and Azeri minority regions that occurred between September and November 2022. Detainees described being raped by security forces and some said they witnessed security forces raping other detainees. In seven of the cases, detainees said that security forces had tortured them to coerce them into making confessions.

“Iranian security forces’ brutality against detained protesters, including rape and torture, are not only egregious crimes, but a weapon of injustice wielded against detainees to coerce them into false confessions,” said Nahid Naghshbandi, acting Iran researcher at Human Rights Watch. “These methods are also a twisted and despicable means of further stigmatizing and repressing marginalized ethnic minorities.”

Human Rights Watch interviewed the survivors by phone between September 2022 and 2023, including five women, three men, and two children. Three shared medical records that supported their accounts.

In December 2023, Amnesty International released a report that documented that security forces “used rape and other forms of sexual violence” to “intimidate and punish peaceful protesters during the 2022 ‘Woman, Life, Freedom’ uprising.” Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and the UN Fact-Finding Mission on Iran have all separately documented Iranian authorities’ use of severe repressive violence in ethnic minority regions.

A Kurdish woman told Human Rights Watch that in November 2022 two men from the security forces raped her while a woman agent held her down and facilitated the rape.

A 24-year-old Kurdish man from West Azerbaijan province said he was severely tortured and raped with a baton by intelligence agency forces in a secret detention center in September 2022. A 30-year-old man from East Azerbaijan province said he was blindfolded and beaten along with other protesters, and he was gang raped with another man by security forces in a van in October 2022.

Human Rights Watch also documented government security forces restraining, blindfolding, and torturing protesters in detention. Authorities beat and sexually assaulted a Baluch woman who witnessed at least two other women being raped in a detention center in Sistan and Baluchistan in October 2022, leaving them physically and psychologically traumatized.

One woman who experienced sexual violence from security forces attempted suicide, while another required surgery for her injuries. A family member of another Baluch woman in her twenties told Human Rights Watch that in October 2022 her relative was raped twice in detention, and after her release she also attempted suicide.

Human Rights Watch previously reported cases of Iranian security forces’ use of torture and sexual assault against men, women, and children, as well as suspicious deaths in detention. The authorities did not provide medical treatment or even basic hygiene supplies to those assaulted by security forces, exacerbating their long-term injuries, and have not investigated these cases or held anyone accountable for these serious violations.

The United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on Iran should continue to investigate these grave abuses as part of its broader reporting on the Iranian government’s serial human rights violations, Human Rights Watch said.

“Accounts of brutal rape and the lasting traumatic consequences of those crimes should mobilize countries to meet the physical and psychological health needs of survivors who have managed to flee Iran,” Naghshbandi said. “They should also mobilize Iranians at home and abroad to push for accountability and justice.”

Rape, Sexual Assault, and Torture in Sistan and Baluchistan Province

A university student from Sistan and Baluchistan, who, like some others interviewed, asked not to identify her by name, told Human Rights Watch that in October 2022, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) forces arrested her, along with approximately 20 other women, after they protested and shouted anti-government slogans. The forces beat all of the women so severely during their arrest that one woman lost consciousness.

They blindfolded and bound the women, then loaded them into a van and took them to an undisclosed location. The woman described the place they were transferred to as a small room with a low ceiling. Security forces separated them into groups of three, in separate cells.

The security forces detained the women for over a month, during which the women were subjected to torture and sexual violence, including being kicked in their genitals to coerce false confessions that they were involved with political groups. The woman interviewed said that security forces handed her papers with Revolutionary Guard letterhead to write and sign a confession:

When I told the interrogator that I am not affiliated with any political party and will no longer participate in protests, he said: “No, you won't cooperate, I'll have to deal with you differently.” Then he called two people and said: “This whore likes to be torn apart.” They tore my clothes apart and brutally raped me. I lost consciousness, and when they poured water on my head, I regained consciousness and saw that my entire body was covered in blood.

They blindfolded her and took her to her cell, where her cellmates told her the same thing had happened to them. She said she could see that they were also badly hurt and scared. They told each other that if they get out alive, they would kill themselves.

She said she was raped three times during her approximately 50-day detention, mostly during the first days of her arrest. She was not given any medicine or hygienic supplies:

They didn’t even give us a single tissue, let alone medical aid. They only gave us a pill every night … I didn’t know what it was, maybe some sort of a sedative or sleeping pill. They would make us take the pill and wouldn’t leave the cell until we swallowed it.

She was forced to sign dozens of pages of confessions without any questions. They accused her of “destroying public property” and “disturbing the security of the population.”

She faced charges of “disrupting public order,” “blasphemy,” and “destruction of public property.” She said after she was released, she had an infection in her kidneys and uterus and underwent surgery twice.

Another person interviewed said that a relative of hers, a Baluch woman in her twenties, was arrested and beaten by Revolutionary Guard forces in October 2022 in Sistan and Baluchistan province while participating in a small protest. The security forces informed the detainee’s family about her whereabouts after four days, and she was only allowed to call them herself after nine days. She was in detention for almost a month, facing charges of “blasphemy” and “collaboration with opposition groups,” before being released on bail.

The relative said that the woman was raped twice in detention and was in very poor physical and mental health after her release, during which she attempted suicide. She was rushed to the hospital where she received life-saving treatment. The woman told her relative that nearly 20 other women ages 20 to 26 were detained with her, and she was aware that two others were sexually assaulted and raped.

Sexual Assault in Kermanshah

A 21-year-old Kurdish woman said that in November 2022 she was arrested by security forces while she was walking toward the university campus in Kermanshah with some other students. They were blindfolded and taken to an undisclosed detention center, where two interrogators raped her:



Two men interrogated me, then a woman came and took me to another room. She told me I needed to take off my clothes for a body search and be transferred to the general ward. While I was busy taking off my clothes, two other men came in; one of them grabbed me with that woman while the other raped me. Once the first was done I was already half unconscious and the other man started raping me. After that, another woman came and gave me a paper towel, telling me to clean myself up. She also took me to another room. The next morning, they blindfolded me again and took me to Razi Square, where they threw me out of the car. I managed to make my way back to the dormitory from there.

Sexual Assault in East Azerbaijan Province

Revolutionary Guard plainclothes agents arrested a 30-year-old male protester in October 2022. They took the man and other protesters who were arrested to a mosque courtyard nearby and blindfolded them and started beating them with batons and tasers. The men were then sent into a police van and told to take off all their clothes. Some of them protested, which he said made the security forces angry. The security forces took the man Human Rights Watch interviewed and another man to a riot control vehicle and forcibly took their clothes off using a taser on their back and behind their knees. Three officers raped both men.

The man interviewed said:

I was blindfolded but I could say that they were raping the other man too since we were next to each other, and I could also hear him crying and begging them to stop. He was in his twenties, and I asked him not to say anything to the others when they took us back. When they took us back, they put us in the van with the others and used pepper spray and closed the doors. After all the beating and torture and rape I felt I was dead and the things I was seeing weren’t real.

He was sent to jail in Tabriz, where he was not provided with any medical or hygienic services and finally was released on bail. He had been bleeding from his rectum for days after his release, he said, and is suffering from severe depression. He said he told the judges he had been raped and that one of them responded: “If you don’t shut up, I will rape you myself as well.”

He faced the charge of “assembly and collusion to commit acts against national security” that ultimately wasn’t substantiated, leading to the charge being dropped and his release.

Torture and Sexual Assault in West Azerbaijan Province

On September 29, 2022, Keivan Samadi, a 24-year-old medical student, was arrested in Oshnavieh by plainclothes officers near his home. Three officers approached him in a car under the pretext of asking for directions. When they got close to him, they threatened him with a pistol and ordered him into their car. He said they pushed his head down so he couldn't see where they were taking him and took him to a hidden detention center.

They placed him in a small cell with a dirty blanket and a toilet without any hygiene items, such as soap. He was held alone in this cell for 21 days, and he was only taken out for interrogation.

(Beirut) – The upcoming visits of the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, to Bangladesh and Nepal should prioritize labor protections for migrant workers, Human Rights Watch said today. Both are key countries for Qatar’s migrant workforce, which makes up 88 percent of the country’s population. Al-Thani is expected to arrive in Bangladesh on April 22, 2024, and in Nepal on April 24.

“It is important for Qatar, Bangladesh, and Nepal to go beyond exchanging diplomatic pleasantries over their longstanding labor ties and seize this moment to publicly commit to concrete, enforceable protections that address the serious abuses that migrant workers in Qatar continue to face,” said Michael Page, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “The Qatari emir should not just meet heads of state, but also visit dialysis centers filled with migrant worker returnees from Qatar and speak with the families of workers who died in Qatar to see the grave consequences of inadequate Qatari labor protections.”

Migrant workers from Bangladesh and Nepal have been indispensable to Qatar’s economy, including in the preparation and delivery of the 2022 World Cup. The Qatar-to-Nepal and Bangladesh routes that the Qatari leader is taking are well-trodden, with thousands of workers making this journey daily. As “guest workers” in a country that does not offer citizenship to most foreigners, the expectation is that workers come to Qatar to work, earn money, and, sooner or later, leave.

Qatar-based jobs have enabled migrant workers to send remittances back home to their families, but many workers leave Qatar worse off than before they migrated. They experience abuses that include wage theft, contract violations, and chronic illness linked to unsafe working conditions.

Many migrant workers do outdoor work and are exposed to Qatar’s extreme heat, and the lack of worker protections from this serious health hazard can take a devastating toll. Some workers also have been deported for demanding their contractually-owed wages and benefits. There have been thousands of unexplained deaths of young, healthy migrant workers in Qatar, and in many cases grieving family members receive neither an explanation of the reasons for their loved ones’ death nor compensation from employers or Qatari authorities.

The governments of Bangladesh and Nepal should not only highlight the importance of remittances but also the high costs that workers often bear to earn them, such as wage theft and recruitment fees. A 2020 survey found that the average recruitment costs for Bangladeshis going to work in Qatar was about US$3,863, equivalent to 18 months of earnings in Qatar. Workers take out informal loans at exorbitant interest rates to pay the fees. Research by Human Rights Watch has shown the role of Qatar-based companies in driving up worker-paid recruitment fees.

Qatar’s failure to safeguard worker rights and inadequate compensation mechanisms means that the responsibility is shifted to the origin countries’ governments to address harm originating in Qatar.

Many workers returning from Qatar are burdened with long-term diseases such as chronic kidney failure , for which the Nepali government provides free dialysis services. Families of many migrant workers who have lost their lives in Qatar rely on compensation through welfare funds set up unilaterally by countries of origin.

Human Rights Watch has documented the experiences of families who received no support from Qatari authorities or their employers despite losing their primary breadwinner, since the causes of their deaths are not classified as work-related.

Recognizing the inadequacies of the compensation system, Qatar’s own Supreme Committee urged its contractors to obtain life insurance for their employees, but this was adopted only by a handful of companies, even at the height of the 2022 World Cup when the world’s eyes were on Qatar’s migrant rights record.

The climate crisis is likely to worsen the risks to workers, which will further increase the care burden to overstretched healthcare systems in countries like Nepal and Bangladesh. These countries themselves are on the front lines of climate catastrophes despite their negligible greenhouse gas emissions.

Qatari authorities have introduced labor reforms, but Human Rights Watch has shown that they came too late and were too little and too narrow in scope. They have not abolished the abusive kafala (labor sponsorship) system that enables these abuses in its entirety.

Qatari authorities have claimed these reforms were not about the World Cup alone but a part of a process that continues beyond the tournament. Yet post-World Cup, many workers were stranded in Qatar in difficult conditions.

The labor agreements that are anticipated to be updated and signed during the emir’s visits should incorporate concrete provisions to address these issues, and the agreements themselves need to be made publicly available, Human Rights Watch said.

The significance of labor reforms or the agreements with migrant origin countries boils down to their implementation and their effectiveness in addressing widespread abuses, which requires strong enforcement mechanisms. Diplomatic visits, labor agreements, or labor reforms ring hollow if homecoming continues to be marred by unpaid wages or benefits, chronic kidney disease , and uninvestigated and uncompensated deaths .

“Public commitments by the Qatari emir to concrete, enforceable worker protections during these two high-profile visits, including compensation to workers who faced serious abuses and families of the deceased, would be the best way to mark his trips to the homes of millions of current and former workers who have helped transform Qatar,” Page said.

This Earth Day is an opportunity to celebrate the work of the courageous people who put themselves at risk fighting for a world in which people and the planet can thrive.

I personally would like to honor Osvalinda Marcelino Alves Pereira. Sadly, she passed away from a long-standing illness just over a week ago. I first met her in 2018: She was a small-scale farmer from Trairão, a village in the state of Pará, in the heart of Brazil’s Amazon.

When I met Osvalinda, she lived on a settlement set up by Brazil’s federal land reform agency. She had been forced to flee her home within her community because of death threats that began in 2011, after Pereira, who had already founded a women's association, also took on illegal loggers.

While still living with her community, Pereira had obtained support from an environmental nongovernmental organization to develop sustainable organic agricultural practices and reforest the area. A group of illegal loggers exploring the area told Pereira to stop. When she did not, they began threatening her, but she persisted and repeatedly reported the issue to the authorities and the police. The authorities did nothing to protect Pereira and her family, which lead to her move in 2018.

Two years later, she returned home but again received death threats. Even in these circumstances she never gave up. She told me many times in the last six years that she would not stop defending nature and the forest, which was, as she repeatedly said, “her home.”

In 2020, Pereira was the first Brazilian woman to receive the Edelstam Prize because she, as the citation read, “fearlessly stood up against the criminal networks in her work to defend the rainforest.” This contributed to Brazil’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and helped mitigate global warming.

Environmental activists are increasingly harassed, intimidated, threatened, or subjected to deadly violence for defending the planet, be they small farmers, Indigenous peoples, people from other Amazon forest communities, or young activists in the streets of Europe and the United States. Individuals like Pereira, who put their lives in danger to protect our world, our rainforests, and the environment, deserve strong support from the global human rights community as they take on one of the world’s most pressing issues.",HIGH,20240422T183000Z,Osvalinda Marcelino Alves Pereira,Osvalinda Marcelino Alves Pereira,Illegal loggers,"Trairão, Pará, Brazil",Increased protection for environmental activists,Death threats and intimidation,Brazil,"Illegal logging, environmental degradation"

(Berlin, April 23, 2024) – Kazakhstan’s President Kasym-Jomart Tokayev signed a new law on April,15, 2024, to strengthen protections from violence for women and children, including domestic violence survivors, but it falls short in key areas, Human Rights Watch said today. The law aims to advance women’s rights and enhance their safety, but among other concerns, it fails to explicitly make domestic violence a stand-alone offense in the criminal code or elsewhere.

“It is significant that Kazakhstan’s leadership has prioritized protecting women and children from violence, and adopting this law is an important step forward,” said Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “But more should be done to ensure that women and children are protected from family abuse in accordance with international human rights standards, including by criminalizing domestic violence as a stand-alone offense.”

The new law, known as Kazakhstan’s “domestic violence” law, introduces amendments to Kazakhstan’s Criminal Code, the Law on the Prevention of Domestic Violence, the Law on Marriage and Family, and other laws. The passage of the new law coincides with the ongoing high-profile trial of Kuandyk Bishimbayev, Kazakhstan’s former economy minister, who is charged with the murder of his wife, Saltanat Nukenova. The trial has drawn national and international attention and ensured a focus on the urgent need to tackle domestic violence with adequate sanctions for abusers and trauma-informed support for survivors.

Women in Kazakhstan face high rates of domestic abuse. According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in 2023 police received 99,026 complaints related to family violence and courts sentenced 67,270 people with administrative sanctions.

The law reimposes criminal penalties for “battery” and “intentional infliction of light bodily harm” committed against “an individual in helpless condition or financially or otherwise dependent on the perpetrator,” the articles most commonly used in domestic violence cases and introduces tougher penalties for convicted abusers. Both offenses had been decriminalized in 2017.

Under the new law, the duty to collect evidence in cases of domestic abuse is assigned to the police, a shift from its being the sole responsibility of the survivor. In addition, the law provides that police must register and investigate all cases of domestic violence, even in the absence of a survivor’s complaint, including in response to reports of domestic violence in the media or on social media.

The law also eliminates the option of seeking “reconciliation” between parties as a way of resolving cases of repeated “battery” and “light bodily harm.”

These are notable and important improvements, but the changes introduced by the law fall short of criminalizing domestic violence as a stand-alone offense either in the Criminal Code or Kazakhstan’s 2009 Law on the Prevention of Domestic Violence.

International human rights law mandates recognizing domestic violence as a serious crime against a person and society, Human Rights Watch said.

But the law lacks a separate definition of the offenses when they occur within the family or household relations, a missed opportunity to ensure that when committed as a form of domestic violence, such offenses, including “battery” and “light bodily harm” are treated as a separate crime from other types of violence, and with the seriousness required by international human rights norms.

The creation of a stand-alone offense of domestic violence, could ensure that other types of violence within the family, such as psychological or sexual violence, are also properly investigated and prosecuted, Human Rights Watch said.

The law includes a reference to the promotion of “traditional family values” based on “strengthening the institute of marriage and family…” Such language risks downplaying domestic violence as such, as well as violence that takes place in unregistered relationships, or is inflicted by relatives or in-laws, and does not reflect a zero-tolerance approach to domestic violence, Human Rights Watch said.

The law also lacks concrete provisions on monitoring and evaluating its implementation and impact. Putting the law into effect without delay, raising public awareness about it, as well as ensuring survivors’ access to justice, services, and support, especially in rural areas, should be the next priorities for the government of Kazakhstan, Human Rights Watch said.

Kazakhstan’s international partners should also take this opportunity to urge the Kazakh government to criminalize domestic violence as a stand-alone offense, establish a monitoring mechanism to ensure the law is being properly implemented, and to ratify the Council of Europe’s convention on preventing domestic violence, known as the Istanbul Convention.

“Women in Kazakhstan have been waiting for comprehensive legislation to help end domestic violence and violence against women, and to effectively prosecute their abusers for a long time,” Williamson said. “It is important for Kazakhstan’s authorities to see the adoption of this law as only the start of many steps needed to eradicate the scourge of violence against women in Kazakhstan.”",MEDIUM,20240423T090000Z,Human Rights Watch,"President Kasym-Jomart Tokayev, Kuandyk Bishimbayev, Saltanat Nukenova",Kazakhstan government,Kazakhstan,"Criminalize domestic violence as a stand-alone offense, establish monitoring mechanisms, raise public awareness, ensure access to justice for survivors",Failure to explicitly criminalize domestic violence as a stand-alone offense,Kazakhstan,"Cultural context surrounding domestic violence, lack of specific legal provisions"

(Johannesburg) – Angola’s parliament should significantly revise or withdraw a proposed national security law that fails to meet international human rights standards, Human Rights Watch said today. The draft National Security Law passed a first vote in parliament on January 25, 2024. Following specialist committee review, the bill is expected to be submitted to parliament for final approval.



The draft law in its current form would permit excessive government control over private institutions, including media organizations, and undermine the rights to freedom of the press, expression, and association.



“The proposed national security law would give the Angolan government broad authority to improperly interfere with the media and civil society groups,” said Zenaida Machado, senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Parliament should stand up for basic rights and freedoms, and substantially revise or reject the current bill.”



The national security bill has not been made public, but Human Rights Watch has reviewed a recent draft. It contains a number of provisions contrary to the rights to freedom of expression and the press set out in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Angola ratified in 1992, and other international and regional human rights treaties. The Angolan constitution also protects these rights.



For instance, draft article 36 gives government security forces the authority to prohibit public or private radio stations from broadcasting and to disrupt some telecommunication services under “exceptional circumstances” without a court order. The bill does not specify what would constitute “exceptional circumstances.” It would also authorize security forces to inspect “establishments or other public places or places open to the public” and “surveil [their] security equipment,” without judicial approval or oversight.



Draft article 40 would require workers of public and private companies and others to report to security forces any facts they become aware of in the course of their duties or because of them that constitute risks and threats to national security. Failure to abide by this provision could result in criminal prosecution.



Domestic and international human rights groups have been highly critical of the draft law. Florindo Chivucute, president of the human rights group Friends of Angola, told Human Rights Watch that the bill posed a long-term threat to Angola’s democracy. The Angolan organization Mãos Livres (Free Hands) expressed concern that the new law would “promote an authoritarian and repressive state.” The Committee to Protect Journalists said the bill could “severely undermine press freedom, further exposing journalists to harassment, intimidation, and censorship by authorities.”



The Angolan government has not publicly discussed the contents of the draft law. The Minister of State and head of the Military House of the President, Francisco Furtado, told members of parliament that it “was not appropriate” to discuss the national security law, and that lawmakers would have the opportunity “to enrich the bill” during specialist committee review. The minister did not respond to a Human Rights Watch text message requesting a comment.



The Angolan government has repeatedly enacted repressive legislation, Human Rights Watch said. In January 2017, then-President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos signed a media law that severely limited freedom of expression. In May 2023, parliament voted on the first draft of the law on the status of nongovernmental organizations, which civil society groups said contradicts Angola’s international legal obligations to uphold the freedoms of expression and assembly.



The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa provide for limitations on the right to freedom of expression to protect national security. However, such limitations must be necessary and proportionate and fulfill certain conditions that the draft law does not provide.



The African declaration of principles adds that “[s]tates shall ensure that any law limiting the rights to freedom of expression and access to information is overseen by an independent body in a manner that is not arbitrary or discriminatory” and “effectively safeguards against abuse including through the provision of a right of appeal to independent and impartial courts.”



The lack of provisions for judicial oversight in the proposed national security law opens the door for the Angolan government to arbitrarily prosecute and criminally charge media and civil society groups, Human Rights Watch said.



“The Angolan government appears intent on using a broad national security law as a pretext to further undermine people’s rights,” Machado said. “Parliament should act to ensure that the media and civil society can operate free from improper government intervention.”",HIGH,20240423T070000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Zenaida Machado, Florindo Chivucute, Francisco Furtado",Angolan government,"Angola, National Assembly",Revise or withdraw the national security law to align with international human rights standards.,"Proposed national security law undermines rights to freedom of press, expression, and association.",Angola,Excessive government control and repression

Today will see a key step in a long-running effort by the UK government to be cruel. The appalling Rwanda deportation bill finally passed through Parliament last night and will soon be given the royal nod to become law.

The government has wasted no time in promising that the first flights of UK asylum seekers to Rwanda would happen soon. Expect a lot of legal challenges along the way, as well as more hate-mongering headlines against foreigners and demonization of human rights defenders in the coming months.

Over the past few years, the government has been pushing this Rwanda deportation idea hard. It’s been a kind of obsession for them. One former UK Home Secretary in the Conservative government even called it that: sending asylum seekers to Rwanda, she said was her “dream” and her “obsession.”

Never mind Rwanda is not a safe place to send people to – it’s well-known for things like extrajudicial killings, deaths in custody, enforced disappearances, and torture. Never mind the UK’s highest court confirmed Rwanda is not safe to send asylum seekers to.

Nope, the UK government has been plowing ahead regardless, trying to circumvent the Supreme Court ruling with this new bill. It’s a move that undermines rule of law and sets a dangerous, undemocratic precedent.

It also adds to their years of undermining evidence, ignoring human rights organizations’ reports, and even ignoring the government’s own assessments of the situation in Rwanda.

Just how far the UK government is willing to go in its obsession can also be put in numbers. According to the National Audit Office – that’s the official spending watchdog in the UK – the plan will cost taxpayers £1.8 million per expelled asylum seeker. That’s US$ 2.2 million each.

Cruelty doesn’t come cheap, apparently.

Has the UK government really not stopped for a second to consider the costs here? Have they not realized they could treat these people humanely in the UK for a fraction of that price?

But the government clearly doesn’t care about the cost of the scheme to taxpayers any more than it cares about the cruelty it will inflict on asylum seekers. What matters to them appears to be signaling that they’re “tough” on asylum seekers, no matter who pays in blood or money.

This obscene obsession has motivated them for so long, they can’t seem to think rationally about the consequences at all. And as with many unchecked obsessions, it has led to madness – financial and moral madness.",VERY HIGH,20240423T131500Z,Human Rights Advocates,Former UK Home Secretary,UK Government,Rwanda,Treat asylum seekers humanely in the UK,Cruelty in treatment of asylum seekers,United Kingdom,Government's obsession with being 'tough' on asylum seekers

(Beirut) – An Iranian court has issued a death sentence to the imprisoned popular rapper Toumaj Salehi on speech-related charges, Human Rights Watch said today. The legal proceedings and sentence against Salehi, 33, are a cruel and outrageous assault on fundamental freedoms and the right to a fair trial.

Amir Raeesian, Saheli’s lawyer, told the Shargh media outlet on April 24, 2024, that Branch 1 of Isfahan’s Revolutionary Court had sentenced his client to death on the charge of “corruption on earth.” In November 2023, Iran’s Supreme Court struck down Salehi’s six-year prison sentence related to this case, referred the case back to the court of first instance, and released him on bail. Iranian security forces rearrested Salehi 12 days later.

“Iran’s revolutionary court judges act like they are empowered to assault citizens’ basic rights and make a mockery of any existing legal safeguards,” said Tara Sepehri Far, senior Iran researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Toumaj Salehi’s outrageous verdict is just latest manifestation of Iran’s brutal justice system. He should be released immediately.”

On October 30, 2022, the authorities violently arrested Salehi, a musician and vocal critic of the government, amid protests following the death in morality police custody of Kurdish-Iranian woman Mahsa Jina Amini the previous month. The authorities held Salehi in solitary confinement and brought multiple charges against him including “corruption on earth,” a vague charge that can carry the death penalty. The Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) reported that government security forces beat Salehi in custody.

On July 10, 2023, Branch 1 of Isfahan’s Revolutionary Court ruled that the threshold for the “corruption on earth” charge against Salehi had not been substantiated, and instead sentenced him to six years in prison under article 286 of the Islamic Penal Code. Article 286 punishes crimes against national security or disruption of public order on a large scale with up to five years in prison or a death sentence if it meets the threshold of “corruption on earth.”

On November 18, Raeesian told Shargh that Salehi had been released on bail after the court struck down the sentence and referred the case back to the court of first instance. Upon his rearrest on November 30, the authorities opened a new case against him for accusing his interrogators of abuse in a video published online. On January 1, HRANA reported that Salehi had been sentenced to one year in prison and a two-year travel ban as punishment in the new case.

On April 18, Branch 1 of Isfahan’s Revolutionary Court held a new trial for Salehi. Raeesian said that the authorities added charges in the case, and the court ultimately convicted Salehi and sentenced him to death for the “corruption on earth” charge. Raeesian alleged that the ruling had significant legal errors, including contradicting the supreme court verdict. He said that they will appeal the verdict.

Human Rights Watch opposes the death penalty in all circumstances because it is inherently cruel and irreversible.

Since the crackdown against protests, Iran’s judicial authorities have drastically increased the use of vaguely defined national security charges against protesters that carry the death penalty, including for destroying public property. Following grossly unfair trials in which many defendants have not had access to legal counsel of their choice, the authorities issued 25 death sentences in connection to the protests. As of April 2024, the government has executed eight who were convicted in connection to the protests The Supreme Court has overturned another 11 death penalty convictions.

Among those arrested during the protests was a Kurdish-Iranian rapper, Saman Seyedi, known as “Yasin.” He was sentenced to death on “enmity against the state” charges, including for alleged “weapon possession and conspiracy to threaten national security,” but the Supreme Court struck down the sentence. On April 21, HRANA reported that Branch 15 of Tehran’s Revolutionary Court had sentenced Seyedi to five years in prison.

The Philippines on April 23 lost a human rights stalwart. Rene Saguisag, a human rights lawyer and former senator, defended victims of abuses during the Ferdinand Marcos dictatorship and was an ardent human rights advocate in the ensuing years. He died of undisclosed causes at the age of 84.

Saguisag, along with Jose Diokno, Lorenzo Tañada, and other human rights lawyers, worked on countless cases for the Free Legal Assistance Group, a pioneering nongovernmental organization that provided pro bono legal assistance to victims of human rights violations. Later, Saguisag formed Mabini, which also helped victims of government abuses. He also assisted in the prosecution of human rights violators, among them leaders of a paramilitary cult.

Saguisag rose to further prominence after the “People Power” uprising in 1986 when Corazon Aquino, who became president after Marcos’s downfall, named him her spokesman. He was elected to the Philippine Senate in 1987. As a senator, he led work promoting government ethics and accountability and was among those voting to close the United States military bases in the country.

After retiring from politics in 1992, Saguisag returned to law and wrote newspaper columns and essays, often almost gleefully recalling his former cases. He also helped the Bantayog ng mga Bayani (Monument of Heroes), a foundation that runs the country’s martial law memorial. He was a fierce critic of former President Rodrigo Duterte’s abusive “war on drugs.”

The last major phase in Guinea’s landmark domestic trial about the brutal massacre of peaceful demonstrators in 2009 concluded on April 23. That last phase, known as the “confrontations,” began on April 15 as judges and all parties posed questions to some of the accused – including Guinea’s former president – as well as victims and witnesses , with a view to reconciling inconsistencies in earlier statements.

The trial involves one of the most brutal events in Guinea’s history. On September 28, 2009, Guinean security forces opened fire on peaceful demonstrators in a stadium during a pro-democracy rally, leaving more than 150 dead. Security forces raped and gang raped more than 100 women, then attempted to cover up their crimes.

Before the confrontations phase, the trial experienced a number of delays following the prosecution’s March 4 request asking judges to reclassify the charges from ordinary crimes to crimes against humanity. Civil parties, which are victims with a standing in the case, supported the request.

Judges heard from all parties on the issue of reclassification during three days of hearings.

Defense counsel argued reclassification would lead to a retroactive application of law, since crimes against humanity were incorporated into Guinea’s law after the acts in question were alleged to have been committed. However, the prosecution and civil parties pointed to Guinea’s ratification in 2003 of the International Criminal Court statute, arguing that, because of ratification, crimes against humanity were part of Guinea’s domestic legal obligations at the time.

On March 20, the judges decided they would rule on the request when they reach a verdict, leaving the question open as the trial moves toward a conclusion. While defense counsel appealed this decision, seeking to have the reclassification issue decided earlier, according to media reports the appeal was dismissed. This paved the way for the trial to resume.

The prosecution, again supported by victims, also sought a “judicial transfer” – a physical visit by the court to alleged locations of mass graves, where scores of bodies connected to the stadium massacre are claimed to have been buried. The judges rejected the request, without providing an explanation.

(Sydney) - The Australian government should include human rights vetting provisions in all bilateral security force cooperation agreements, Human Rights Watch said in a submission to the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. The committee is reviewing a proposed agreement between Australia and Fiji for defence cooperation.

“The Australian military should not support, train, or appoint to its ranks anyone credibly accused of committing serious human rights or humanitarian law violations anywhere,” said Daniela Gavshon, Australia director at Human Rights Watch. “The proposed agreement with Fiji should include a vetting clause, which would set an important precedent for future bilateral military agreements.”

Human rights vetting provisions would require the Australian Defence Force to check that any person they work with from a foreign military has not been credibly accused of serious human rights violations. Currently, Australia does not have a transparent and legislated system for vetting security force cooperation as do some other countries. Even without such a system, the Australian government should ensure that it does not work with human rights abusers by including a standard human rights vetting clause in all bilateral security force agreements.

In January 2024, the Australian Defence Force appointed Fijian Col. Penioni (Ben) Naliva as deputy commander of Australia’s 7th Brigade in Brisbane. A 2011 report to the United Nations Human Rights Council by the UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression specifically identified this person as having a role in the alleged torture of a former Fijian politician. The Australian government appointed Colonel Naliva without any formal vetting process, and maintains it was unaware of the allegations prior to his appointment. A mandated security force vetting requirement could have prevented his appointment, Human Rights Watch said.

“Australia has taken action against its own soldiers who have committed serious violations, so it certainly shouldn’t deploy with soldiers from other countries responsible for abuses,” Gavshon said. “Having a vetting requirement would safeguard against this.”",HIGH,20240425T224500Z,Human Rights Watch,Col.

Pro-Palestine university campus protests have spread across the United States, with harsh crackdowns at some institutions, including Columbia University, the University of Texas, and Emory University. These include mass suspensions, evictions from university housing, and arrests of students, faculty, legal observers, and journalists covering these events.

Columbia University students set up tents on campus on April 17 to express solidarity with the Palestinian people. Student groups said they were protesting Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, which has killed over 34,000 people and left well over a million displaced and starving . Protesters also demanded that the university divest holdings in companies profiting from the assault on Gaza and Israel’s unlawful settlements in the occupied West Bank.

Also on April 17, Columbia’s President Minouche Shafik testified at a congressional hearing on antisemitism. On April 18, she suspended the protesters, revoking their access to campus. In a letter to the New York Police Department, Shafik said Columbia “provided multiple notices and warnings and informed the encampment participants that they must disperse or face immediate discipline.” Shafik said the protesters were violating Columbia’s rules and policies, and raised safety concerns. She said the encampment posed a “clear and present danger” and asked the police to help remove the protesters.

The Columbia Law School Human Rights Institute, 54 members of Columbia Law School’s permanent faculty, and the Knight First Amendment Institute, among others, criticized Shafik’s decisions, with the Knight Institute condemning the “alarming decision to call on the NYPD to dismantle a student encampment.”

The university previously suspended Columbia’s chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace, after administrators claimed the groups “repeatedly violated University policies related to holding campus events.” In response, the New York Civil Liberties Union and the organization Palestine Legal filed a lawsuit in March against the university for its “unlawful suspension” of these groups for “engaging in peaceful protest.”

Shafik told the US Congress that Columbia updated policies and procedures to address rising antisemitism on campus. She described as a central challenge “[t]rying to reconcile the free speech rights of those who want to protest and the rights of Jewish students to be in an environment free of harassment or discrimination.”

There have been troubling reports of antisemitic incidents in and around Columbia University’s campus. Allegations of antisemitic acts and speech by individuals, as well as acts of Islamophobia and other forms of discrimination, should be investigated and addressed on the merits in a case-by-case basis, through fair and transparent processes.

As protests spread to campuses across the country, university administrations should be careful not to mislabel criticism of Israeli government policies or advocacy for Palestinian rights as inherently antisemitic or to misuse university authority to quash peaceful protest. Instead, universities should safeguard people’s rights to assembly and free expression.",MEDIUM,20240426T230000Z,Columbia University,Minouche Shafik,Columbia University administration and NYPD,"Columbia University, New York, US","Safeguard rights to assembly and free expression, fair investigation of incidents",Harsh crackdowns on peaceful protests,United States,"Protests related to Israel’s military actions in Gaza, rising antisemitism concerns"

On October 13, 2023, Israeli strikes in southern Lebanon killed Issam Abdullah, a Reuters journalist. The attack injured six other journalists from Reuters, Agence France-Presse (AFP),

and Al Jazeera.

SOUNDBITE: Dylan Collins AFP Journalist

I will always remember his, his wit and his humor. He was the dynamo of the press scene and of Reuters in general.

SOUNDBITE: Carmen Joukhadar Al Jazeera Journalist

I don’t think there is anyone that is funnier than Issam. I don’t think there’s anyone more supportive than Issam.

VO:

Human Rights Watch investigated the attack to determine the cause, who carried it out and its legality.

SOUNDBITE: Dylan Collins AFP Journalist

I don't know what justice looks like. We lost someone and he’s not coming back. And Christina [injured AFP colleague], her life will never be the same. I don't know how you, I don't know how you replace that. For me, justice, the only type of justice that we can get now is accountability.

VO:

Visual evidence suggests that Israeli forces targeted the journalists, who were filming at a known live position far from military targets. The attacks were likely deliberate and an apparent war crime.

SOUNDBITE: Dylan Collins AFP Journalist

We’re a group of seven journalists, all wearing press vests, all wearing helmets with cameras, with three live feeds for three international agencies. And we were hit twice directly in a matter of 37 seconds.

VO:

The digital investigations team at Human Rights Watch verified 49 videos and dozens of photos from before, during and after the incident, analyzed satellite imagery of the area,

interviewed witnesses, and consulted with arms and audio experts. Among the visual evidence collated by Human Rights Watch is the feed from the cameras of the journalists who were there that day.

VO:

Just before 5 p.m. on October 13th the seven journalists from Reuters, Agence France-Presse and Al Jazeera congregated in Alma Al-Shaab in southern Lebanon, roughly one to two kilometers from the Israeli border.

SOUNDBITE: Carmen Joukhadar Al Jazeera Journalist

For us it was a good location because we were able to film the strikes without putting our lives at risk.

VO:

They were there to report on clashes between the Israeli military and Lebanese and Palestinian armed groups in southern Lebanon.

SOUNDBITE: Dylan Collins AFP Journalist

When we arrived around 5 p.m. We were really only just filming this this huge pillar of smoke that was coming, rising up beyond a hill to our south, along the border. And maybe about 15 minutes later, we started to see incoming shelling from the Israeli side hitting the

the areas in Lebanon along the border. We were calm, collected, working as safe as you can in this kind of environment.

VO:

Evidence reviewed by Human Rights Watch indicates that the Israeli military knew or should have known that the group of people they were firing on were civilians.

Around 5:54, Elie Brakhia, an Al Jazeera journalist, took a selfie with Issam Abdallah, the Reuters journalist, with the sun setting behind them. “Good evening,” Elie texted, in Arabic.

SOUNDBITE: Dylan Collins AFP Journalist

So around a little bit before 6 p.m., about one minute before we were hit, there was a what looked to be a tank fire fired from the “Hanita military base (in Israel),” fired across the valley

into a hilltop, basically maybe a kilometer and half away from us.

And I took out my phone to take a video of it. And basically, as soon as I took out my phone to take a video, I was going to inform our newsroom about the development. And as soon as I took out my phone, we were hit the first time. But basically big explosion.

The first one. I looked to my right and I saw my colleague Christina on the ground screaming,

saying, “I can't feel my legs.”

VO:

Human Rights Watch has verified footage from four cameras that caught captured the first attack. The first strike directly hit and killed Issam Abdallah, who was near the short rock wall.

SOUNDBITE: Carmen Joukhadar Al Jazeera Journalist

I see a flame and soil and then I hear the sound. I see Christina and I see Issam. And then I run in the other direction. I go to the car, our car the Al Jazeera car. I sit next to it for a little bit. But then I told myself no, cars are targets. This is what they tell you in training. So as I was running to get away from it......another missile hit the car. And it exploded, all of it.

And this is what caused all the shrapnel in my back because I was running to get away.

SOUNDBITE: Dylan Collins AFP Journalist

Getting hit once or firing once could be a mistake. But there were two direct it was two direct shots at us. You can't say that's a mistake.

VO:

Audio analysis, witness testimony and satellite images reviewed by Human Rights Watch suggests that at least one munition was fired from Israeli territory, approximately 1.5 kilometers to the southeast. Analysis of the video taken in the minutes before the attack further suggests that the group was targeted by the Israeli military.

Three cameras captured the same scene, but in each one light appears to be either static, blinking, or absent, depending on the camera. Experts said this could suggest the

use of infrared targeting or range-finding technology, suggesting the Israeli military was actively observing the journalists and proceeded to target them.

SOUNDBITE: Dylan Collins AFP Journalist

We lost a colleague. My colleague has, life altering injuries, and I want to know, I want to know who pulled the trigger.

SOUNDBITE: Carmen Joukhadar Al Jazeera Journalist

Today it was us. Tomorrow it will be someone else. Justice is that those who committed all these crimes are held accountable.

VO:

Since Human Rights Watch began this investigation, two journalists, Rabih Al-Maamari and Farah Omar were reportedly killed in an Israeli strike in the southern Lebanese town of Tayr Harfa, some 2.3 kilometers from where Issam Abdullah was killed.

At least 61 journalists have been killed in the hostilities in Israel and Gaza, according to the Committee to Project Journalists. The committee said the first month of hostilities marked “the deadliest month for journalists” since they began documenting journalist fatalities in 1992.

Journalists are protected under international humanitarian law against direct attacks. Targeting journalists constitutes a breach of the Geneva Conventions.

“Historic,” said the activist Haris Azhar, describing Indonesia's Constitutional Court ruling in March to revoke three false news and defamation clauses from the country’s 1946 criminal code.

The judges wanted to protect human rights, he said, and they found that the code’s vague definition of “fake news” could be used to punish legitimate criticism of the government.

Azhar and Fatia Maulidiyanti, another human rights defender, together with the Jakarta-based Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation and the Alliance of Independent Journalists, sought a judicial review of the law after Azhar and Maulidiyanti faced criminal defamation charges brought by Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, a minister in President Joko Widodo’s cabinet. Pandjaitan’s lawsuit argued that the activists defamed him in a YouTube podcast in August 2022. A Jakarta court acquitted the activists in January 2024.

Powerful people and government officials frequently used the laws to prosecute activists and other critics of the government. According to Safenet, a free speech organization, between 2020 and 2023, there were 32 criminal defamation cases in Indonesia. After the court ruling, some cases were immediately dropped.

But Indonesia has dozens of criminal defamation laws that could undermine the right to free expression, including those recently passed as part of the 2022 criminal code and the 2023 Internet and Electronic Transaction Law.

Azhar points out that the 2023 internet law is “even more brutal” than the Dutch colonial-era provisions, which made up most of the 1946 code, because it allows the government to take down digital content without a judicial order. The United Nations has said the 2022 criminal code, slated to come into force and replace the 1946 criminal code in January 2026, threatens basic freedoms.

The new criminal code makes promoting news that a person should know or suspect is vaguely “uncertain,” “exaggerated,” or “incomplete,” and which can cause unrest, a criminal offense that can be punished by up to two years in prison.

Other articles effectively restrict anyone other than medical providers from disseminating information about contraception to children, or from providing information to anyone about obtaining an abortion.

Authorities should revise the new criminal code to reflect the court ruling. “We need to challenge these new laws,” Azhar said.

(Washington, DC, May 02, 2024) – Governments concerned about autonomous weapons systems – so-called killer robots – should urgently act to start negotiations on a new international treaty to ban and regulate them, Human Rights Watch said today. Such weapons would select and use force against targets based on sensor processing rather than human inputs.

“The world is approaching a tipping point for acting on concerns over autonomous weapons systems, and support for negotiations is reaching unprecedented levels,” said Steve Goose, arms campaigns director at Human Rights Watch. “The adoption of a strong international treaty on autonomous weapons systems could not be more necessary or urgent.”

On April 29 and 30, 2024, more than 1,000 representatives from 144 countries and international organizations, industry, academia, and civil society, including Human Rights Watch, attended a high-level international conference in Vienna on the problems raised by autonomous weapons systems. The conference featured a message from Pope Francis and remarks by the foreign ministers of Austria, Albania, Bangladesh, Costa Rica, and Sierra Leone, as well as the United Nations disarmament chief and president of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Nearly every speaker emphasized the seriousness of this issue and the need for urgent action.

The conference host, Austria, issued a chair’s summary of the meeting, which “affirms our strong commitment to work with urgency and with all interested stakeholders for an international legal instrument to regulate autonomous weapons systems.”

The Vienna conference followed a series of regional meetings on autonomous weapons concerns over the past 14 months, in Costa Rica, Luxembourg, Trinidad and Tobago, Philippines, and Sierra Leone. Most issued regional communiques calling for the urgent negotiation of a legally binding instrument containing prohibitions and restrictions on autonomous weapons systems.

On December 22, 2023, 152 countries voted in favor of the first UN General Assembly resolution on autonomous weapons systems, while four voted no and 11 abstained. General Assembly Resolution 78/241 asks UN Secretary-General António Guterres to seek the views of countries and other stakeholders on ways to address the challenges and concerns raised by autonomous weapons systems “from humanitarian, legal, security, technological and ethical perspectives,” and reflect those views in a report to the General Assembly in the second half of 2024.

“All countries have a role to play in preventing machines from taking human life in armed conflict and law enforcement,” Goose said. “Governments should submit their views to the UN on the concerns and challenges raised by autonomous weapons systems and express their support for negotiating a new international treaty.”

Some autonomous weapons systems have existed for years, but the types, duration of operation, geographical scope, and environment in which such systems operate have been limited. However, technological advances are spurring the development of autonomous weapons systems that operate without meaningful human control, delegating life-and-death decisions to machines. The machine rather than the human operator would determine where, when, or against what force is applied.

For the first time, discussion of “lethal autonomous weapons systems” has been added to the provisional agenda of the annual session of the UN General Assembly, which opens in September. The General Assembly provides an inclusive and accessible forum for countries to address this issue. Tackling the killer robots challenge under its auspices would allow greater consideration of concerns that have been largely overlooked in discussions held thus far, including ethical perspectives, international human rights law, proliferation, and impacts on global security and regional and international stability, including the risk of an arms race and lowering the threshold for conflict, Human Rights Watch said.

Most treaty proponents have called for prohibitions on autonomous weapons systems that by their nature operate without meaningful human control or that target people, as well as regulations to ensure that no autonomous weapons systems can be used without meaningful human control.

Talks on lethal autonomous weapons systems have been held at the Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW) in Geneva since May 2014 but have failed to deliver a substantive outcome. The main reason for the lack of progress under the CCW is that its member countries rely on a consensus approach to decision making, which means a single country can bar passage of a proposal. A handful of major military powers have exploited this to repeatedly block proposals to negotiate a legally binding instrument.

“Autonomous weapons systems are a grave problem that can affect any country in the world, so clear, strong, global rules are essential,” Goose said. “Voluntary measures such as codes of conduct and political declarations only pave the way for a future of automated killing.”

As our climate burns out of control, too many politicians are dithering – and worse.

I get it. Reality is hard. It requires difficult decisions. It’s so much easier for politicians to present a fantasy world, to deny or downplay the science of human-driven climate change. And when anyone rejects your fantasy thinking and demands climate action, you simply use state power to shut them up.

Governments are increasingly turning to repression against those calling on their leaders to take steps to address the climate crisis. They are threatening environmental defenders in many parts of the world, using intimidation, legal harassment, and, absurdly, counterterrorism laws against climate activists. Sometimes, they even resort to deadly violence.

In Australia’s state of New South Wales, for example, the government created a new law targeting protesters who block roads or ports. The bizarre result is that activists who temporarily inconvenienced some people have been sent to maximum security prisons for months – meanwhile, people committing violent crimes like assault can avoid being sent to jail altogether.

In the UK, there’s also an ongoing crackdown on climate protesters. Recently enacted laws severely restrict people’s right to peaceful protest. In December, a peaceful climate protester who took part in a slow march on a public road for about 30 minutes, was sentenced to six months in prison.

Europe is likewise failing, with newly introduced repressive laws and practices in several countries. Authorities are targeting environmental movements, which are now sometimes labelled “terrorist threats,” and attacked them with legal prosecutions and police brutality.

A clampdown on environmental activism is happening elsewhere, too – Uganda, India, the list goes on.

But here’s the thing: repression doesn’t change the reality of the climate crisis. Harassment, arrests, imprisonment, killings... none of that slows humanity’s release of carbon into the atmosphere, which is the actual problem here.

For many Afghans, the country’s armed conflict has never ended.

The armed group Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP) attracted worldwide attention in March when it attacked the Crocus City Hall in Moscow, killing at least 143 people and injuring many others. Since emerging in Afghanistan in 2015, the group has carried out a bloody campaign mostly targeting Shia-Hazara mosques and schools and other facilities in predominantly Hazara neighborhoods.

In the most recent attack, on April 29, an armed member of the group opened fire on worshippers at a Shia-Hazara mosque in western Herat province, killing six, including a child. On April 20 , a magnetic bomb attached to a bus whose passengers were primarily Hazara exploded, killing one and injuring 10. On January 6, a similar attack on a bus in Dasht-e Barchi, a predominantly Hazara neighborhood of Kabul, killed five people, including at least one child, and injured 14. Dasht-e Barchi has been the site of numerous ISKP attacks. When ISKP claimed responsibility for the January 6 attack, they said it was part of their “kill them wherever you find them” campaign against “infidels.”

Between 2015 and mid-2021, ISKP attacks killed and injured more than 2,000 civilians primarily in Kabul, Jalalabad, and Kandahar. Since the Taliban took over Afghanistan in August 2021, these attacks have continued – killing and injuring over 700.

The Taliban have long battled the ISKP, which have also targeted Taliban personnel. A suicide bombing outside a Kandahar bank on March 21 killed at least 21 people and injured 50, many of them Taliban ministry employees who had lined up to collect their salaries.

Attacks on Hazara and other religious minorities and targeted attacks on civilians violate international humanitarian law, which still applies in Afghanistan. Deliberate attacks on civilians are war crimes. Beyond the immediate loss of life, such attacks incur lasting damage to physical and mental health, cause long-term economic hardship, and result in new barriers to education and public life.

Earlier this week, the Special Criminal Court (SCC) of the Central African Republic issued an arrest warrant for former president François Bozizé. He is charged with crimes against humanity allegedly committed between February 2009 and March 23, 2013, by the Presidential Guard and other security services at the Bossembelé military training center, referred to as “Guantanamo,” north of the country’s capital Bangui.



In April 2013, I interviewed 10 former detainees from Guantanamo who described conditions of near-starvation, constant beatings, torture, and extrajudicial executions. Later, I was taken to see two cells on either side of Bozizé’s private villa, concrete shafts in the ground with just enough space for a person to stand. A cement enclosure on top of the enclosures had air holes for a person to breathe, but no space to move. Reliable accounts by former prisoners indicate that individuals were placed in these cells and left there until they died.



The SCC is a novel court established to investigate and prosecute serious international crimes committed in Central African Republic since 2003. The court is staffed by both national and international judges and personnel.



Bozizé first fled Bangui in March 2013 as the Seleka, a mostly Muslim rebel coalition, took control of the Central African Republic amid widespread abuse, much of which was committed by Bozizé’s presidential guard, which killed at least hundreds of civilians and destroyed thousands of homes during unrest in the mid-2000s. Impunity for alleged crimes dates back even further. The Seleka gave rise to local militias, called anti-balaka, who in turn targeted Muslim civilians and displaced hundreds of thousands of people.



Bozizé returned to the country in 2019 as it was wracked with conflict and later emerged as a key leader in a rebel coalition that attacked Bangui in late 2020 before going back into hiding in Guinea-Bissau.



Umaro Sissoco Embaló, the president of Guinea-Bissau, has told local media that he was surprised by the arrest warrant and that Bozizé had not done anything in Guinea-Bissau to call into question his exile status. Bozizé has been a glaring example of impunity in the Central African Republic for over a decade.

Iranians woke up on Monday to the news that President Ebrahim Raeesi, Foreign Minister Amir Abdollahian, and several other government officials were killed in a helicopter crash in Iran’s East Azerbaijan province. How Raeesi’s death will affect human rights in the country is already the subject of much commentary.

Since the early years after the 1979 revolution, no high-level Iranian officials have been held to account for serious human rights violations, and Raeesi is closely affiliated with this legacy of abuse. Many families have placed Raeesi near the top of the list of officials they wished to see brought to justice for the government’s most egregious crimes.

Raeesi was one of four people who sat on a panel and issued death sentences against thousands of political prisoners in 1988. These panels made a mockery of fair trial standards, and the resulting mass executions should be investigated as crimes against humanity.

Raeesi formerly headed Iran’s judicial branch, and when he served as president, the executive branch. He bore significant responsibility for many repressive policies, including the deadly crackdowns against widespread protests in 2019 and the 2022 “women, life, freedom” protests following Mahsa Jina Amini’s death while in the morality police's custody. Raeesi also shoulders much responsibility for the executions of protesters after unfair trials, prosecution of peaceful dissidents, and the enforcement of the country’s abusive, compulsory hijab laws.

Yet it is important to recognize that Iran’s repressive machinery goes beyond the power of the president. Absent fundamental change, these violations can be expected to continue.

Under Iran’s constitution, a presidential election should be held within 50 days. Authorities are reportedly considering June 28 as the tentative date. Historically, Iran’s presidential elections have been far from free or fair, but they offered a narrow opportunity for parts of society and candidates to weigh in on issues, including some social and political freedoms.

For more than a decade, Iran’s Guardian Council has led the way in systematically disempowering elected bodies as spaces to influence government policy, including by narrowing the pool of eligible candidates so that even the speaker of the parliament was disqualified from the 2021 presidential elections.

(Beirut) – The Iraqi government should immediately reverse the recently passed law that punishes same-sex conduct and transgender expression with imprisonment, Human Rights Watch said today. The law violates fundamental human rights, including the rights to freedom of expression, association, privacy, equality, and nondiscrimination of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in Iraq.

On April 27, 2024, Iraq’s parliament passed the anti-LGBT law as an amendment to the country’s existing “Law on Combatting Prostitution,” No. 8 of 1988. The new law punishes same-sex relations with a penalty of between 10 and 15 years in prison as well as allowing for a prison term between 1 and 3 years for people who undergo or perform gender-affirming medical interventions and for “imitating women.” The law also provides for 7 years in prison and a fine between 10 million Iraqi dinars (US$7,700) and 15 million dinars (US$11,500) for “promoting homosexuality,” which is undefined.

“The Iraqi parliament’s passage of the anti-LGBT law rubber-stamps the Iraqi government’s appalling record of rights violations against LGBT people and is a serious blow to fundamental human rights,” said Rasha Younes, interim LGBT rights director at Human Rights Watch. “The law adds insult to injury for LGBT people in Iraq, who are already facing violence and threats to their lives.”

Though consensual same-sex conduct was not previously explicitly criminalized in Iraq, the authorities have historically used vague “morality” laws to prosecute LGBT people. The introduction of the anti-LGBT law follows months of hostile rhetoric against sexual and gender minorities by Iraqi officials, as well as government crackdowns on human rights groups. Previous proposed amendments to the anti-prostitution law would have imposed the death penalty for same-sex relations, but this provision did not appear in the final version.

The new law, which Human Rights Watch reviewed, equates same-sex relations with “sexual perversion,” which it defines as “repeated sexual relations between members of the same sex … if occurring more than three times.”

The new law also specifically targets transgender women. It allows for a prison term between one and three years or with a fine between 5 million dinars (US$3,800) and 10 million dinars (US$7,700) for “imitating women,” which it defines as “wearing makeup and women’s clothing” or “appearing as women” in public spaces.

The law prohibits hormone therapy and what it calls “sex change” based on personal desire, as well as any attempt to change one’s gender identity, punishable by prison terms between one and three years. The same penalty applies to any surgeon or other doctor who performs gender-affirming surgery. The law makes an exception for cases of people born with intersex traits, when a surgeon is performing an operation to “normalize” the sex characteristics into classical male or female aesthetics.

Iraq’s new anti-LGBT law builds on and reflects an increasing effort by anti-LGBT legislators to explicitly make same-sex relations and transgender expression a criminal offense. The immediate precursor to the law passed in April was a bill introduced on August 15, 2023, by Raad Al-Maliki, an independent member of parliament.

If passed in its original form, the bill would have punished same-sex relations with the death penalty or life in prison, punished “promoting homosexuality” with a minimum of seven years in prison and a fine, and criminalized “imitating women” with up to a three-year sentence. In introducing the bill, Al-Maliki said its purpose was to “preserve the entity of the Iraqi society from deviation and calls for ‘paraphilia’ [abnormal sexual impulses] that have invaded the world.”

The introduction of the 2023 bill in turn followed a proposed anti-LGBT law put forward by legislators in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. In September 2022, members of the Kurdistan Regional Parliament introduced the “Bill on the Prohibition of Promoting Homosexuality.” Under the bill, anyone who advocates for LGBT rights or “promotes homosexuality” would face up to a year in prison and a fine of up to five million dinars (US$3,430). The bill would also suspend, for up to one month, the licenses of media companies and civil society organizations that “promote homosexuality.”

Although the bill was not passed, it was introduced amid a heightened crackdown on free assembly and expression in the Kurdistan region. On May 31, 2023, a court in the region ordered the closure of Rasan Organization over “its activities in the field of homosexuality.”

Violence and discrimination against LGBT people are already rampant in Iraq. The targeting of LGBT people online and lethal violence against LGBT people by armed groups in Iraq has routinely been met with impunity, Human Rights Watch said.

On August 8, 2023, the Iraqi Communications and Media Commission issued a directive ordering all media outlets to replace the term “homosexuality” with “sexual deviance” in their published and broadcast language and banning use of the term “gender.”

Iraqi authorities’ continued attacks against LGBT people and activists violate their basic rights, including their right to privacy, free movement, free expression, assembly, and association, including on the internet, as well as their right to nondiscrimination and protection under the law. The abuses violate Iraq’s Constitution and international treaties to which Iraq is a party.

Unequal protection against violence and unequal access to justice are prohibited under international law. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, in its articles 2 and 26, guarantees fundamental human rights and equal protection of the law without discrimination. The United Nations Human Rights Committee, the international expert body that provides authoritative interpretations of the covenant, has made clear that sexual orientation is a status protected against discrimination under these provisions. Similarly, the Arab Charter on Human Rights, of which Iraq is a member, affirms these rights.

“Relentless abuses against LGBT people in Iraq, starting with the family and stretching into every aspect of their public life, not only results in the deaths but makes people’s lives unlivable,” Younes said. “The Iraqi government should immediately repeal the anti-LGBT law and end the cycle of violence and impunity against LGBT people.”",VERY HIGH,20240520T063000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Mariam, Rasha Younes, Raad Al-Maliki",Iraqi government,Iraq,"Repeal anti-LGBT law, protect LGBT people from violence, uphold human rights.",Introduction of anti-LGBT law and violations of human rights,Iraq,"Increased anti-LGBT sentiment among Iraqi officials, societal discrimination"

People in the United States are more reliant than ever on using the internet for all aspects of their lives. But one in six US households may lose internet access by June when current federal funding for the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) ends. This puts millions of underserved people in the US, including people of color, older people, and people with disabilities, at risk of losing their ability to telework, receive telemedicine, attend online classes, and maintain social connections, among other daily essential activities.

The ACP emerged in 2022 as a means-tested program that reduces low-income households’ monthly internet bill by $30 (or $75 in Tribal lands). Some legislators have proposed extending the program through the end of the calendar year, with a budget of between $6 and $7 billion, about half of its initial budget of $14.2 billion. One of the funding proposals would also further restrict household income eligibility, potentially disqualifying 7.4 million currently eligible households.

Cynthia George, 71, is retired and lives on a low, fixed income. She recently told CNN that she uses the internet to find grocery deals and stretch her food stamps entitlement. Cynthia fears that if the ACP is defunded, she’ll have to choose between paying for the internet or food.

Cynthia isn’t alone. People aged 65 and older comprise almost 20 percent of the ACP’s recipients and in recent surveys the overwhelming majority of older people expressed concern about losing access to online social security, Medicare, healthcare services, and communication with loved ones.

Access to the internet is essential for the realization of a broad range of rights in the US, and for millions of people, the ACP is essential for keeping them connected. Rather than widening the already stark digital divide in the US, Congress should commit to permanently and robustly funding the ACP or otherwise promptly putting in place effective policies to ensure underserved people, including older adults, can access the internet.",HIGH,20240522T011500Z,underserved populations,Cynthia George,United States Congress,"Huntington Park, California",Congress should commit to permanent funding for the ACP to ensure internet access for underserved populations.,Potential loss of internet access due to defunding of the Affordable Connectivity Program,United States,"Financial constraints, legislative inaction, income eligibility restrictions"

Despite Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s pledge last February to “appropriately handle” the flow of government aid to Myanmar’s abusive military, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official told the Diet this week that Japan’s construction giant, Yokogawa Bridge Corp., will make further payments to the military-owned Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) for an aid project.

In March 2021, Myanmar Now reported that a steel mill owned by the MEC was supplying steel for Japan’s Bago River Bridge Construction Project and “profiting enormously.” Financial transactions analyzed by Human Rights Watch show that from July 2022 to January 2023, Yokogawa Bridge Corp. transferred around US$2 million to MEC for the project, with United States government approval.

During a House of Councilors session, Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa said that the MEC’s participation ended in December and that Yokogawa Bridge Corp.’s “progress payments” to the MEC had finished. However, Hideki Kusakabe of the Foreign Ministry’s International Cooperation Bureau responded to a question by opposition lawmaker Michihiro Ishibashi by saying that Yokogawa Bridge Corp. still had certain payments to make for the project. Kusakabe did not disclose a sum or a timeline.

The MEC generates vast revenue through businesses in sectors including manufacturing, mining, and telecommunications, according to a 2019 report by the United Nations-backed Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar. The US, United Kingdom, European Union, Canada, and Australia have sanctioned the MEC and Myanmar’s other military conglomerate, Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited, for their role in generating significant revenues that help fund military abuses.

Since the February 2021 military coup, Myanmar’s military has been responsible for widespread and systematic human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings, torture, and indiscriminate attacks on civilians that amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes.

Prior to the coup, Myanmar’s security forces committed crimes against humanity and acts of genocide against the Rohingya in Rakhine State, forcing hundreds of thousands to flee to Bangladesh in 2017. An estimated 600,000 Rohingya remain in Rakhine State, where in recent months they have been caught in fighting between the Myanmar military and the Arakan Army armed group and subjected to forced recruitment by the junta.

(Washington, DC) – The decision by Ecuador’s President Daniel Noboa to announce that the country is in an “internal armed conflict” has contributed to serious human rights violations by security forces, Human Rights Watch said today in a letter to President Noboa. The violations include at least one apparent extrajudicial killing and multiple cases of arbitrary arrests and ill-treatment.

On January 9, 2024, following a surge in violence, including the takeover of a state-owned TV channel, President Noboa decreed an “internal armed conflict” against 22 criminal groups operating in Ecuador, labeling them “terrorists.” Since then, overall killings in Ecuador have decreased, according to the government, but extortions and kidnappings have risen and the security situation remains dire.

“The escalation of violence—and the increase in organized crime—in Ecuador jeopardize Ecuadorians’ lives and institutions,” said Juanita Goebertus, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. “Instead of announcing a baseless ‘armed conflict,’ the government needs to respond with an effective and rights-respecting security policy that protects Ecuadorians.”

Between January and April, Human Rights Watch interviewed a dozen victims of abuse, along with their relatives and lawyers; requested information from multiple government ministries and agencies; analyzed 33 photographs and videos posted online; attended several court hearings virtually; and reviewed case files. Previously, in November 2023, researchers met with Attorney General Diana Salazar, as well as with several prosecutors, judges, and experts on organized crime in Guayaquil and Quito to document the causes of the increased criminal violence in the country.

Homicides in Ecuador increased by 574.30 percent from 2019 to 2023, from a rate of just over 7 to more than 47 per 100,000 people, the Ecuadorian Observatory on Organized Crime reported. Two large gangs—Los Choneros and Los Lobos—are allied with Colombian, Mexican, and Albanian drug traffickers and fight for control of territory and drug trafficking routes.

The ‘armed conflict’ announcement followed a violent takeover of the state-owned TV channel, TC Television, and the prison escape of José Adolfo “Fito” Macías Villamar, the leader of Los Choneros. Noboa ordered the Ecuadorian Armed Forces to carry out “military operations, under international humanitarian law and respecting human rights to neutralize” the 22 groups.

Under international law, the existence of an armed conflict is determined by a factual analysis of criteria including the level of organization of the armed groups and the intensity of hostilities. The Ecuadorian government has consistently failed to present sufficient evidence that fighting with any of the 22 criminal groups constitutes a non-international armed conflict.

Between January and April, the number of homicides in Ecuador dropped by 27 percent, the government reports. But extortions and kidnappings have risen, and the recent killings of three mayors and the director of a prison show that the situation remains serious. Ecuador’s militarization of its streets and prisons, meanwhile, has led to serious human rights violations by security forces.

In one case Human Rights Watch documented, soldiers killed 19-year-old Carlos Javier Vega and injured his cousin Eduardo Velasco in Guayaquil on February 2. The army said that Vega and Velasco had “attempted to evade a control point by ramming into military personnel” and labeled them “terrorists.” But Human Rights Watch interviews with witnesses, relatives, and lawyers of the victims—along with verified videos, photographs, and court records—contradict the army’s account, including its assertion that the young men were involved with criminal groups.

Throughout Ecuador, many people reported arrested appear never to have been taken before a prosecutor or judge. Although the police and military are required to inform prosecutors about arrests they make, many of the over 13,000 people reported arrested appear to have been detained for short periods outside of the legal process and, based on videos and photographs posted online and verified by Human Rights Watch, subjected to reprimands, beatings, and other degrading treatment.

The military, which has controlled Ecuador’s prisons since January, has held detainees incommunicado, at times hampering their right to consult with lawyers or to obtain medical assistance. Soldiers appear to be responsible for multiple cases of mistreatment and some cases of torture in prison. At a court hearing, one detainee described guards whipping him on the back with a cable and stepping on his finger. “Since they supposedly couldn’t hit me yesterday because I’m sick, they made me spread my legs and hit me in the testicles,” he said.

Authorities appear to have taken few steps to prevent human rights violations or ensure that those responsible are held to account. Instead, members of the National Assembly said in a statement that they were willing to pass an amnesty or pardon “whenever necessary to guarantee the work” of the police and army. President Noboa accused a judge who found human rights violations in prisons of being “unpatriotic.”

“The Armed Forces are not trained for policing and investigations. Putting them in that role heightens the risk of abuses, and the government should limit this to strictly necessary circumstances.” Goebertus said. “Ecuador needs more and better-trained justice and law enforcement officials investigating organized crime, not more soldiers on the streets.”",VERY HIGH,20240522T061500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Carlos Javier Vega, Eduardo Velasco, President Daniel Noboa",Ecuadorian Armed Forces,"Guayaquil and Quito, Ecuador","Limit military involvement in policing, improve training for law enforcement officials","Serious human rights violations including extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests, and ill-treatment",Ecuador,"Surge in organized crime, takeover of state-owned TV channel, prison escapes"

Re: “internal armed conflict” and human rights violations in Ecuador

Dear President Noboa:

I write on behalf of Human Rights Watch to share an assessment of your government’s response to heinous abuses by criminal groups since you announced an “internal armed conflict” in Ecuador over four months ago.

Human Rights Watch has been monitoring, with dismay, the increase in violence in Ecuador, which in recent years has become one of the countries with the highest homicide rates in the region.[1] We have repeatedly called on authorities to ensure effective and rights-respecting security policies that protect the Ecuadorian people, in particular, by strengthening the country’s fragile justice system.[2]

We were concerned that on January 9, 2024, your government announced that there is an “internal armed conflict” in the country, an assertion that appears to lack legal basis and could open the door to human rights violations. We have since requested information from government offices, interviewed victims and witnesses of abuses, verified photographs and videos posted online, and reviewed court documents, to analyze the effectiveness of your policies, in addition to documenting human rights violations committed since the announcement.[3]

This letter outlines our findings and recommendations since the announcement of an “internal armed conflict,” as well as our analysis of human rights violations related to the armed conflict.

An “Internal Armed Conflict” in Ecuador?

On January 9, 2024, you passed a decree announcing an “internal armed conflict” against 22 criminal groups operating in Ecuador, which your government labeled “terrorists.”[4] You ordered the Armed Forces to carry out “military operations, under international humanitarian law and respecting human rights to neutralize” these groups.[5]

We are very concerned at the uptick in violence in the country and the incidents that took place on January 8 and 9, including the takeover of the state-owned TV channel TC Television and the escape from prison of José Adolfo Macías Villamar, alias “Fito,” who leads the criminal group “Los Choneros.”[6]

However, the existence of an armed conflict—international or non-international— does not depend on the declaration or determination made by a government or its president, but on an objective analysis of the facts on the basis of criteria established under international law.[7] A non-international armed conflict consists of “protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups.”[8] It requires two elements: i) a level of organization of the armed groups and ii) a level of intensity of hostilities.[9]

The decision to describe fighting with criminal groups as a non-international armed conflict is not only a technical matter of international law—it has real-life consequences for Ecuadorians. Given that international humanitarian law, which is only applicable during armed conflicts, allows for broader use of force, including at times lethal, a decision to allow armed forces to apply rules of engagement under international humanitarian law, even when the criteria for such a decision have not been objectively met, opens the door to human rights violations.

We analyzed in detail your decree and the police reports it cites and requested information from multiple government offices to examine your government’s legal argument for considering the situation an armed conflict. Based on the foregoing, we have concluded that your government has failed to present sufficient evidence to consider the fighting with any of these 22 criminal groups a non-international armed conflict. Similarly, the Constitutional Court has ruled that your government has “not provided sufficient information to justify the existence of one or more non-international armed conflicts.”[10]

In fact, your own government has produced evidence contradicting your conclusion that the current fighting would amount to an armed conflict. For example, while the “organization” requirement for an armed conflict hinges, in part, on the existence of a command structure with the capacity to sustain military operations,[11] a police report you cited in your January 8 decree indicates that the criminal groups in the country are “flexible and unstable” and “lack a structured criminal enterprise.”[12]

Effectiveness of the Measures Adopted

Since January, Ecuador has allegedly witnessed a decrease in the number of homicides. As your government has noted, the number of “violent deaths” decreased 27 percent by April 2024.[13] However, the increased levels of extortions and kidnappings, [14] as well as the recent killings of three mayors and the director of a prison,[15] show that the situation continues to be dire.

Between January and April 19, the Attorney General’s Office reports receiving 18,000 reports of crimes. It says it obtained 217 convictions, all but one in cases of “flagrancy,” and started trials on 38 other cases, all for cases of “flagrancy.”[16] Normally, cases involving people arrested in ""flagrancy"" are not strategic prosecutions aimed at dismantling organized crime groups, but rather involve lower-level perpetrators accused of less violent crimes.

Many people were apparently never taken before a prosecutor or judge—a practice that raises concerns about possible abuse, as well as failure to effectively investigate.

Ensuring effective and rights-respecting security policies in relation to the criminal groups operating in Ecuador requires strengthening the justice system. In particular, based on interviews with prosecutors, judges, and organized crime experts, we respectfully recommend that your government urgently:

Take steps toward creating a well-trained and resourced investigation unit in the Attorney General’s Office, so that prosecutors do not have to rely on the police to conduct investigations.

Increase the number and capacity of forensic investigators, prosecutors and judges investigating and prosecuting organized crime and corruption, including through specialized training on organized crime, corruption, and money laundering, along with training to ensure rights-respecting investigations.

Increase the funding of the protection mechanism for prosecutors and judges and ensure a periodic review of their risk situation.

Work with the Attorney General’s Office to develop a strategy to prioritize the investigation and prosecution of high-level corruption-related cases and money laundering in order to help dismantle organized crime groups, including their associates in positions of power.

Adopt measures to strengthen the investigation and prosecution of corruption-related cases, including by passing rights-respecting legislation to seize assets of organized crime groups, following the popular vote on question 6 in the April 21, 2024 referendum.

Reestablish the Ministry of Justice, which was closed in 2018, so that it can oversee the prison system and coordinate judicial efforts between the judiciary, the Attorney General’s Office, law enforcement agents and the prison system.

Human Rights Violations

Since January 9, Human Rights Watch has documented multiple instances of serious human rights violations committed by security forces.

As described in detail in the annex to this letter, these include one apparent extrajudicial killing, several arbitrary arrests, and many cases of ill-treatment in prison which may in some cases amount to torture. Our research indicates that the total number of human rights violations committed since you announced an “armed conflict” are likely much higher.[17]

A large number of people reported arrested appear never to have been taken before a prosecutor or judge. Although the police and military are required to inform prosecutors about the arrests they carry out, many people appear to have been detained for short periods of time outside of the legal process and subject to reprimands, beatings or other degrading treatments by soldiers and police.[18]

Additionally, the military, which has been in control of prisons since January, has held detainees incommunicado, at times hampering their right to consult with lawyers or to obtain medical assistance. As described below, soldiers appear to be responsible for multiple cases of mistreatment and some cases of torture in prison.

We are concerned that Ecuadorian authorities appear to have taken few to no steps to prevent human rights violations or to ensure that those responsible are held to account. On the contrary, on January 9, members of the National Assembly said they were willing to pass an amnesty or pardon “whenever necessary to guarantee the work” of the police and army.[19] Such legislation could violate Ecuador’s obligation under international human rights law to investigate, prosecute and punish human rights violations, and the Assembly’s proposal sends a worrying message that invites security forces to commit violations with impunity.

Instead of taking measures to prevent abusive arrests, the government has publicly backed the security forces and you have accused a judge who found human rights violations in prisons of being “unpatriotic.”[20]

To ensure accountability for abuses that have occurred and prevent new human rights violations, we respectfully urge you to:

Review your decision to apply rules of engagement under international humanitarian law, in line with the Constitutional Court’s decision and international law.

Limit the role of the Armed Forces to circumstances in which their use is strictly necessary. As the Inter-American Court of Human Rights has said, the involvement of armed forces in public security “should be “exceptional,” “subordinated and supplementary to the work of civil agencies,” “regulated, by legal mechanisms and protocols on the use of force” and “supervised, by competent, independent and technically capable civil authorities.”[21]

Strengthen disciplinary mechanisms for prevention and accountability both at the National Police and Armed Forces, including by ensuring constant monitoring and assessment of complaints received by civilian authorities, civil society groups and others, and guarantee effective criminal investigations.

groups and others, and guarantee effective criminal investigations. Publicly condemn reported human rights violations by security forces, making it clear that such cases will not be tolerated and that security forces are required to fully collaborate with prosecutors on investigations into these abuses.

End the military’s control over prisons and commit to a reform of the prison system that addresses long-standing issues such as overcrowding, delays in processing penitentiary benefits, limited access to basic services, lack of a real social rehabilitation programs, and the small number and poor training for prison guards, among others.

End incommunicado detention and ensure that detainees can communicate and receive visits from their families and lawyers and are guaranteed access to health care and other basic services.

Instruct the military and the National Service for Comprehensive Attention for Detained Adults and Teenage Offenders (Servicio Nacional de Atención Integral a Personas Adultas Privadas de la Libertad y a Adolescentes Infractores, SNAI) to ensure that detainees are taken to court whenever their appearance is required by a judge under Ecuadorian law.

We urge your government to give due consideration to these recommendations and take proactive measures to safeguard the rights of all Ecuadorians. We continue to follow, with concern, the high levels of violence in the country and reiterate our openness to meet to discuss our findings and recommendations, in a constructive manner.

Annex: Evidence of Human Rights Violations Obtained by Human Rights Watch

Since mid-January, Human Rights Watch has requested information from government offices, interviewed victims and witnesses of abuses, verified photographs and videos posted online, and reviewed court documents, to document reports of human rights violations committed since the announcement of an “armed conflict” in Ecuador.[22]

The following is a summary of the evidence we have obtained and the cases we have documented.

Apparent Extrajudicial Execution

On March 11, 2024, the Ecuadorian government said that 15 alleged “terrorists” had been killed in security operations since January 9.[23] As of April 19, the Attorney General’s Office had opened eight ongoing investigations into possible extrajudicial executions.[24] Human Rights Watch has received reports of two possible extrajudicial killings since January and documented one other case, finding evidence indicating that it amounted to an extrajudicial execution.

On February 2 at 5:37 p.m., the army posted on their official Facebook page that they had apprehended two terrorists “who had tried to attack a military checkpoint.” The army said soldiers “fired their weapons” when a car “attempted to evade control by ramming into military personnel.”[25] Carlos Javier Vega, 19, died, and his cousin, Eduardo Velasco, was injured in the incident. The post also included two photographs of Eduardo and Carlos blurred out lying on the ground and one photograph of their red Chevrolet with bullet holes in the windows.

Human Rights Watch interviewed witnesses and the relatives and lawyers of the victims, verified videos and photographs, and reviewed court records, identifying evidence that contradicts the army’s account.

According to Eduardo, on the day of the incident, he and Carlos were going to sell a dog near the Universidad Politécnica Salesiana in Guayaquil.[26] Around 11:30 a.m., they encountered three soldiers standing on the street, blocking traffic. Eduardo said he briefly left the vehicle to explain to the soldier that they were headed to the university, which was five minutes away, but the soldiers denied them access. [27]

Eduardo said he returned to the car and drove in reverse. He recalls he accidentally struck a police vehicle that was parked and, nervous, drove forward, brushing the boot of a soldier.[28] He said one soldier opened fire while the car was stopped, hitting Carlos and then another one hitting him.

Eduardo tried to take Carlos to the hospital but was forced to stop the vehicle due to his shoulder injury. He said he shouted for help, but the soldiers who arrived at the scene insulted them and failed to provide assistance.[29]

The army seems to have been slow to provide aid to Carlos and Eduardo. Human Rights Watch verified 15 photographs and five videos, all recorded roughly 65 meters west of the supermarket “Mi Comisariato” in the Domingo Comín avenue in Guayaquil, showing the moments after Carlos Javier was shot. One video shared on Facebook on February 2, 2024, at 1:12 p.m. shows at least 10 members of the military and a police officer standing or kneeling near to Carlos and Eduardo’s red Chevrolet Aveo.[30] Three-armed soldiers are kneeling next to Carlos, who is lying face down on the street next to the right side of the vehicle. One of the armed force members carries a slung rifle close to Carlos’ chest.

Security forces eventually took Carlos to a hospital, where he died the following day due to internal bleeding from a lacerated lung and intestine. His body had four projectile entry wounds, according to the autopsy report, which Human Rights Watch reviewed.[31]

The army’s statement posted on social media describes Carlos and Eduardo as “terrorists,” a term the government uses to describe criminal groups. A case opened against Eduardo, which Human Rights Watch reviewed, shows no evidence of them belonging to a criminal group or even carrying guns that day.[32]

Eduardo was charged with “assault” and “resisting arrest” and put under house arrest. But on March 22 the prosecutor asked a judge to close the investigation against Eduardo.[33] The case was closed on April 10 and Eduardo was released.

A prosecutor in Guayaquil is investigating the army’s role in the incident, though the investigation remains in a preliminary stage.[34]

Arbitrary and Abusive Arrests

On March 11, the government reported that 13,073 people had been arrested since January 9.[35] (The government has not published on social media new data on people arrested since.)

Many people appear to have been detained for short periods of time outside of the legal process and subject to reprimands, beatings and other degrading treatments by soldiers and police.[36]

Moreover, Human Rights Watch received testimonies of people who say their relatives and neighbors were arrested simply because they were passing by an area where someone else was being detained or where security forces were conducting a raid.[37] According to human rights organizations and lawyers, these arrests have especially impacted young men in poor neighborhoods.[38]

For example, Human Rights Watch documented a case where 22 people were arrested on January 20, 2024, all accused of “terrorism.”[39]

That day, the military raided two homes and found cell phones, cash money, motorcycles and weapons.[40] According to a police report reviewed by Human Rights Watch, the operation stemmed from messages found on the cell phones of two individuals regarding the sale of a weapon. One of the detainees, whose name Human Rights Watch withholds for security, was arrested when they were watching the raid outside one of these homes, according to their lawyer.[41] The police report on, which Human Rights Watch reviewed, provides no evidence against them.[42]

For several days, the detainee’s relatives were unaware of their whereabouts. They received contradictory information from the authorities about the prison to which they had been taken, until they found that that they had been taken to Latacunga prison, over 180 kilometers away from their house in Echeandia.[43]

The case file, which Human Rights Watch reviewed, provides no evidence linking this person to “terrorism,” or any other crime. On March 4, a prosecutor changed the charges to “arms trafficking.”[44].

Human Rights Watch also verified videos showing beatings and other abusive treatment during arrests.[45] For example:

Two incidents captured on video, and posted on social media on January 12, 2024, show two people being beaten by armed forces. A video shared on X, formerly Twitter, on January 12, 2024, shows at least seven soldiers surrounding a man on the ground on Avenue VP1 in El Guabo, El Oro province. The man is naked and appears to be trying to speak with the armed forces. One of the soldiers repeatedly kicks and beats the man. Another video circulated on Telegram on the same day filmed nearby on the corner of VP1 avenue and Luis Aguilar shows five soldiers near a person on the ground. One of the armed forces members hits the person with a large stick and kicks him in the back.

A video circulated on X, on January 16, 2024, shows at least six members of the armed forces standing near two men lying face down on the sidewalk on Pío Jaramillo Alvarado Avenue in Guayaquil. One is in a white shirt, the other is in red. Both men’s shirts are over their heads. One officer is standing on the back of the man in the red shirt. The camera moves closer to the man in the white shirt and an armed forces member removes the shirt from his head, showing the man’s face which is bruised and cut as he is forced to say his name. A photograph from the same X post shows the man’s left eye bloodshot and swollen. The camera moves to the man in the red shirt and shows an armed forces member kicking him in the back before the man repeats his name twice for the camera.

A video circulated on X, on February 3, 2024, recorded at night, shows a group of 11 armed forces members gathered next to a pickup with a flashing beacon on the dashboard while one of them severely beats two people with an unidentified type of baton on the corner of Abel Gilbert avenue and Manuel Díaz Grandos in Durán, Guayas province.

In addition, Human Rights Watch analyzed but could not verify the locations and dates of six videos that show three different instances where armed men wearing the same types of camouflage uniforms worn by Ecuadorean Armed Forces members in other videos verified by Human Rights Watch during this investigation, humiliated, whipped, beat, stepped on, and kicked detainees in the back of military vehicles. In one of the cases—documented in four videos shared on X, on January 15, 2024—armed forces members whipped two people, who are either fully nude or have their pants lowered, on their buttocks and on the top of their legs with batons.

In two other cases—documented in two videos shared on X, on January 11 and January 30, 2024—armed men in camouflage step on and beat detainees who are tightly packed shoulder to shoulder in a truck bed. The video from January 11, shows at least five people lying down with their hands zipped tied behind their backs. Human Rights Watch was unable to verify the dates and locations these videos were filmed in due to a lack of visual information. The videos all appear to have been recorded by members of the armed forces present when the abuses took place.

Prison Conditions and Abuse

In recent years, Human Rights Watch has documented that lack of state control, as well as overcrowding and poor prison conditions, have contributed to organized crime groups' control of prisons and resulted in prison massacres. We have repeatedly called on authorities to take steps to re-establish control over prisons and improve guards’ training.[46]

We are concerned about your government’s decision on January 8 to transfer the control of prisons to the military, which has little to no training or experience in handling prisons.

We have documented that the military has held most detainees incommunicado, that is, unable to see their relatives, lawyers or officials of the Ombudsperson’s Office, since the beginning of the military takeover in January, in some cases, hampering their right to prepare their defense and consult with lawyers.[47] As the UN Human Rights Committee, the body of independent experts that monitors implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by its states parties, has noted, “prolonged incommunicado detention” amounts to arbitrary detention and would generally be regarded as a violation of the prohibition against cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment.[48]

Officials in the penitentiary system have also reported that, for weeks, the military restricted Health Ministry officials from or did not allow them to enter prisons, leaving detainees without access to doctors.[49]

The military’s takeover of prisons has also meant that the System of Integral Attention to Persons Deprived of Liberty (SNAI), which continues to be in charge of transferring detainees, has been unable to present some people detained to their court hearing, even when required by a judge. Under Ecuadorian law, prison authorities’ failure to take a detainee to a court hearing makes the detention arbitrary and unlawful.[50]

Soldiers have also engaged in repeated cases of abuses against detainees. Human rights organizations, detainees and their families, as well as members of the Catholic church, which conducted assistance programs in prisons, have reported restrictions in the provision of food, medicines and other basic services, cases of beatings, use of teargas, electric shocks, sexual violence and deaths at the hands of soldiers.[51] Similarly, the Ombudsperson’s Office told Human Rights Watch that they have received “multiple alerts” regarding “alleged violations of rights” including possible cases of torture and ill-treatment.[52] As of April 19, the Attorney General’s Office had opened investigations into 46 possible cases of torture committed since January 9.[53]

Human Rights Watch attended virtual court hearings or reviewed court documents regarding three habeas corpus proceedings, in which several detainees reported that soldiers beat them, threw away their medicines, and in some cases tortured them.[54] For example, one detainee said:

Since they supposedly couldn’t hit me yesterday because I’m sick, they made me spread my legs and hit me in the testicles, they hit me with the cable on the back…They even threw gas at us, they stepped on my finger.[55]

Another said:

Every day they [hit] us with a stick, with an electrical cable, with whatever they have on hand. They treat us like we’re nothing, like we’re worthless, like we’re the lowest of society.[56]

Human Rights Watch also analyzed videos showing instances of abuse in prisons, including:

A video shared on Telegram on January 15, 2024, showing the forceful movement of detainees at a prison in Archidona, Napo province. The video shows many members of the armed forces and police officers stationed in the southwest section of the facility. Police officers are shown dragging six prisoners, who have been stripped of their shirts, by the back of their necks, heads, and hair into the prison’s courtyard. Human Rights Watch could not identify when this video was recorded but was unable to find earlier versions posted online before early January 2024.

A video that circulated on X on January 16, 2024, shows at least nine soldiers standing near a large group of shirtless detainees in the northwest courtyard of a prison in Turi, close to the city of Cuenca. The armed forces use teargas on the east side of the group and the wind carries the irritant over the rest of the prisoners. Prisoners react in pain and crawl from the gas toward the courtyard's west side. One of the soldiers kicks and beats prisoners with a stick. Human Rights Watch could not identify when this video was recorded but was unable to find earlier versions posted online before early January 2024.

The Singaporean government since mid-April has issued at least four execution notices to individuals convicted of drug-related offenses. They are among 36 death row prisoners taking part in a legal action relating to their constitutional right to legal aid following appeal. None of these prisoners currently have legal representation.

The executions of these prisoners have been put on hold, awaiting the outcome of the court application.

But the Singaporean government remains determined to use the death penalty, even as the global trend is towards abolition. On May 8, Singapore’s home minister, K. Shanmugam, announced that the Post-Appeal in Capital Cases Act (PACC), which was passed in 2022, would imminently come into force. This law will severely curtail prisoners’ ability to appeal their convictions and further undermine fair trial and due process rights in capital cases in Singapore.

In his address, in which he defended the country’s use of capital punishment as an “effective” deterrent, the home minister hit out at Singapore’s anti-death penalty activists, who have long been the target of government harassment and intimidation. He publicly named five anti-death penalty advocates, including a media outlet, who because of their activism have previously been subject to orders under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), a law that gives the government broad discretionary powers to censor online content.

The Singaporean government has a track record of silencing and intimidating opponents of the death penalty. Last year, the authorities suspended the law license of prominent human rights lawyer M. Ravi for five years: the maximum sanction for a lawyer’s misconduct. He was accused of making “grave and baseless accusations of improper conduct” on Facebook against the attorney-general, after M. Ravi managed to have the death sentence of his client, Malaysian national Gobi Avedian, set aside on the grounds of miscarriage of justice.

United Nations experts and governments have repeatedly called on Singapore to abolish, or impose a moratorium, on the death penalty, and to halt the targeting and silencing of anti-death penalty activists. But these efforts have so far been to no avail.

Top EU diplomat Josep Borrell showed what a principled commitment to justice looks like, on May 7, when he pushed back against threats aimed at undermining the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) Palestine investigation. “If we respect the ICC, it has to be in any case, on any occasion, with respect to anyone,” he said.

On May 23, the EU marks its ninth Day Against Impunity, shortly after the ICC prosecutor’s application for arrest warrants for grave international crimes committed in Israel and Palestine since October 7, 2023. ICC judges are now considering that request.

Now, EU member countries face a critical test, when it comes to their support for victims’ equal access to justice.

The EU and its member states have contributed to a strong response to serious crimes committed in Ukraine, Myanmar, Syria, and other places, supporting international and domestic justice efforts. In the past, they have also provided critical political support when the ICC justice process came under attack by those fearing accountability.

They should now apply that same principled commitment to securing justice for grave abuses in Israel and Palestine. EU members like Belgium, Ireland, Slovenia, Spain, and France have indeed expressed support for the court’s independence, even as attempts to threaten the court and its officials – particularly by some US lawmakers – intensify.

However, some responses from EU members since the ICC prosecutor announced applications for arrest warrants have been less than supportive or even critical.

The ICC is doing precisely what its members, including all EU countries, set it up to do. The EU and its members should present a common front to advance justice for atrocities committed in Israel and Palestine, as well as globally, no matter the alleged perpetrator. They should also take action to stop the commission of further crimes and unequivocally back any independent judicial effort to bring about accountability; be it through the ICC, the UN Commission of Inquiry, the International Court of Justice, or before national courts in EU countries.

Yemeni law and the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty prohibit any use of antipersonnel landmines under any circumstances.

“Houthi forces flouted the landmine ban for years and Yemeni civilians are paying the price as these weapons kill and wound indiscriminately,” said Niku Jafarnia, Yemen and Bahrain researcher at Human Rights Watch. “There is an urgent need to step up clearance of landmines to save lives, prevent unnecessary suffering, and ensure people can safely access their homes and livelihoods.”

The presence of uncleared landmines has had a devastating impact on residents of al-Shaqb, a village in Sabir Al-Mawadim district on the mountainous outskirts of Taizz city. Out of a few thousand residents—there has been no census since 2004—28 have been injured and six killed by landmines in the years immediately following a 2015 siege of Taizz and the surrounding areas, according to the community leader.

Human Rights Watch researchers visited al-Shaqb in April 2024 and interviewed seven residents, including four landmine survivors, two people whose family members were killed by landmines, and al-Shaqb’s community leader. All four survivors have a permanent disability from their injuries. Everyone interviewed had been displaced from their homes to a nearby village.

Human Rights Watch also interviewed officials from two national mine clearance coordination agencies, the Yemen Executive Mine Action Center (YEMAC) and the Yemen Mine Action Coordination Center (YMACC), and a member of the Yemeni National Commission for Human Rights who has documented landmine use in the area.

Al-Shaqb is located in a valley between two mountain peaks, one controlled by the internationally-recognized Yemeni government (Mazaal Peak) and the other controlled by Houthi armed forces (Al-Saleheen Peak), the adversaries in Yemen’s conflict since 2014. While al-Shaqb is on a front line, most active fighting ceased several years ago, though snipers remain in the area and sporadically shoot at and sometimes kill civilians. Most recently, on March 23, residents said a Houthi sniper shot and seriously injured a child who was coming home from school.

Most of al-Shaqb’s residents, many of whom are farmers or herders, were displaced from their land earlier in the conflict. According to al-Shaqb's community leader, over 257 families have been displaced. With the decrease in active fighting in the past few years, several residents trying to return to their homes, tend to agricultural land, or graze their livestock have been killed or seriously injured by antipersonnel mines, and their animals have also been killed. Many of those injured have a permanent disability.

Several residents said that starting in 2018, Houthi forces began entering their land at night to place landmines in and around their homes and farmland. According to the mine clearance organizations, al-Shaqb is contaminated by a significant number of antipersonnel mines.

One man interviewed said he was displaced from his home in 2016 due to the fighting. In August 2022, with the fighting reduced, he returned home to retrieve some wheat stored in his house. He stepped on what he said was a yellow bottle in front of the front door and the bottle exploded. He lost several fingers in the blast, which severely injured his leg, other body parts, and his eyes, leaving him with a permanent disability and scarring.

The landmines have also made it more difficult for villagers to feed themselves and maintain their incomes. According to the World Food Programme, as of February 2024, 64 percent of Taizz governorate’s population do not have sufficient food, and Taizz is one of four governorates in Yemen facing “high risk and deteriorating” food insecurity.

One woman interviewed said that a landmine killed her father when he returned to his farm in February 2021. She said that even though the farm was on the front line, her father and other agricultural workers continued to go there to farm because it was their source of income and that there were “only snipers” in the area. “He used to go to the valley every day to farm, and he had no idea there were landmines there,” she said.

Abdullah, a 35-year-old man, lost both his legs to a landmine in June 2022, when he took his goats to graze at a farm in the area. “I used to feed my goats in the same farm every two or three days,” he said. “It was my land and nobody lived there. My life became very difficult after the incident. I used to work as a driver and in other jobs, but I'm not working anymore, just sitting in the house.” People with disabilities in Yemen face barriers to accessing quality health services, education, and employment opportunities.

A child interviewed said that a landmine killed both of his parents in 2022. His mother was killed just outside their front door in February 2022. His father was killed one month later while farming. “He would farm every day,” the boy said. “Then one day he entered his land in the morning to farm as usual and was blown up.”

The use of landmines has also exacerbated extreme food insecurity. “We have agricultural lands that we used to cultivate with qat [and vegetables for our personal use], and then sell it to get the money that we need to cover our needs and expenses,” the first man said. But now, these lands in the front lines are contaminated so we can’t go there anymore. The people who went to these lands and who were [seriously injured or killed by mines] were forced to do so because of how significant their needs are and due to the poor situations they are in.”

A total of 164 nations are party to the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, which prohibits use, production, transfer, and stockpiling of antipersonnel mines and requires their clearance and assistance to victims. The use of antipersonnel landmines is banned in all circumstances, as they are indiscriminate weapons that cannot differentiate between civilians and combatants.

Yemen ratified the treaty on September 1, 1998, committing to never use antipersonnel mines under any circumstances and to prevent and suppress activities prohibited by the treaty. In April 2002, Yemen reported to the UN secretary-general that it had finished destroying its stockpile of antipersonnel mines as required by the Mine Ban Treaty.

Human Rights Watch has monitored Yemen’s policy and practice on antipersonnel mines since 1999 and has documented in depth numerous incidents of Houthi use of antipersonnel mines in Taizz and other governorates, including in 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2019. Houthi authorities informed Human Rights Watch in April 2017 that they consider the treaty binding. In addition to the prohibition on use in the Mine Ban Treaty, individuals responsible for using prohibited weapons or carrying out indiscriminate attacks may be prosecuted for war crimes.

The Landmine Monitor initiative by the International Campaign to Ban Landmines reported that at least 582 people were killed or wounded by landmines or other explosive remnants of war in Yemen in 2022, up from 528 in 2021.

Al-Shaqb's location on the front line presents a security challenge for demining organizations, due to the sporadic sniper activity. However, Human Rights Watch also spoke to people in areas that are no longer on the front lines who are still displaced due to the continued presence of landmines.

Greater international assistance is urgently needed to equip and assist clearance personnel to systematically survey and clear mines and explosive remnants of war from Yemen, Human Rights Watch said. The Yemeni government, the Houthis, who are the de facto authorities in much of Yemen, and international agencies should provide appropriate compensation, assistance, support, and employment opportunities to those injured and to the families of those injured or killed, as well as to other landmine victims in Yemen. Assistance should include medical care, including reconstructive surgery and psychosocial support, prosthetics and other assistive devices where appropriate, and ongoing rehabilitation if needed.

Human Rights Watch is a founding member of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, 1997 Nobel Peace Prize co-laureate for its efforts to bring about the Mine Ban Treaty.

(Washington, DC) – Argentina’s President Javier Milei should reconsider his nominations to the Supreme Court to take qualifications, experience, diversity and integrity into consideration, Human Rights Watch said today.

On April 15, 2024, President Milei nominated Ariel Lijo, a federal judge, and Manuel García-Mansilla, a scholar, to the Supreme Court. Several rights groups, citizens, business associations, and scholars have formally expressed concern over the nominations, particularly regarding Lijo’s record as a federal judge. In addition, if the nominations are confirmed, there would be no women on the five-member court. Supreme Court nominations must be approved by a vote of two-thirds of the Senate.

“Argentina needs to strengthen judicial independence, the rule of law, and efforts to combat corruption,” said Juanita Goebertus, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. “The government should carefully consider the concerns raised about Judge Lijo and ensure that all nominees to the Supreme Court have the highest integrity and qualifications.”

The Supreme Court has been functioning with only four members since 2021, when justice Elena Highton de Nolasco resigned. The current members are facing a politically motivated impeachment process in Congress initiated in 2023 by former President Alberto Fernández (2019-2023). Under the Constitution, Supreme Court judges need to be reappointed to continue in their posts once they turn 75, although some judges have questioned the constitutionality of this provision. Justice Juan Carlos Maqueda will turn 75 in December and has said he will retire. The Milei administration has made clear that the president does not intend to reappoint him.

Lijo currently has three pending disciplinary investigations in the Council of the Judiciary, the body charged with investigating and removing federal judges. He has faced 29 other disciplinary proceedings that were closed, including 16 in limine, meaning without any analysis, according to a study by the human rights group Asociación Civil por la Igualdad y la Justicia (ACIJ). Some proceedings were based on allegations that Lijo delayed, and otherwise manipulated, investigations into corruption. A 2016 report by a lawyers’ association found seemingly “anomalous” delays, at times of over a decade, in at least 28 corruption investigations handled by Lijo’s court.

Lijo and his brother Alfredo, who admitted to lobbying judges, were also criminally investigated for “money laundering” and “bribes,” among other crimes. In 2021, a federal judge closed the investigation against them, in a decision that Argentine legal experts have described as “controversial.” According to media reports, the judge failed to analyze a report by Argentina’s financial investigation unit, detailing possible evidence of suspicious financial transactions.

Several Argentine human rights organizations, associations of lawyers, and business unions have expressed concern about Judge Lijo’s nomination to the Supreme Court. Some fear that senators from across the political spectrum might seek to trade a vote for Lijo in exchange for having him use his position in the Supreme Court and his influence in the federal court system to close corruption investigations against people close to the senators, including former government officials.

The nomination of two men for the vacancies is also contrary to a 2003 presidential decree calling on authorities to consider “gender diversity” in the selection process.

Under the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, which Argentina has ratified, governments must “take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in [...] political and public life.”

According to a study by the Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLAC), with data from December 2021, Argentina’s Supreme Court was the only high court in Latin America, the Caribbean, and the Iberian Peninsula without any women on its bench.

“Having an all-male Supreme Court sends a troubling message to Argentina’s many highly qualified women lawyers and scholars about their ability to serve in prominent roles in the judiciary,” Goebertus said.",MEDIUM,20240523T063000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Javier Milei, Ariel Lijo, Manuel García-Mansilla, Elena Highton de Nolasco, Juan Carlos Maqueda, Juanita Goebertus",President Javier Milei,"Supreme Court of Argentina, Buenos Aires",Reconsider Supreme Court nominations to include qualified diverse candidates and uphold integrity in judicial appointments,"Failure to consider qualifications, experience, diversity, and integrity in Supreme Court nominations",Argentina,"Political motivations in judicial appointments, lack of gender diversity in nominations"

This historic resolution asks the UN secretary-general to seek the views of countries and other stakeholders on “ways to address the challenges and concerns raised” by such weapons systems “from humanitarian, legal, security, technological and ethical perspectives.”

This submission briefly summarizes our work on this issue, outlines specific challenges and concerns raised by autonomous weapons systems, and elaborates on ways to address these challenges and concerns through a legally binding instrument.

I. Background

Human Rights Watch is an international nongovernmental organization (NGO) in consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. We conduct research and advocacy to uphold human dignity and promote human rights and international human rights law across the globe. For more than 30 years, Human Rights Watch has documented and advocated for the prevention of civilian harm and human suffering caused by a range of arms, including landmines, cluster munitions, incendiary weapons, chemical weapons, and explosive weapons used in populated areas. We work to advance humanitarian disarmament, an approach that aims to prevent and remediate arms-inflicted human suffering and environmental harm through the establishment and implementation of norms.

In October 2012, Human Rights Watch co-founded the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots with six other NGOs working in the field of humanitarian disarmament.[1] The coalition, which is now comprised of more than 270 NGOs in 70 countries, advocates for the negotiation and adoption of an international treaty to prohibit and restrict autonomous weapons systems. On behalf of Human Rights Watch, Mary Wareham served as founding coordinator of the campaign from 2012 to 2021.

II. Challenges and Concerns Raised by Autonomous Weapons Systems

This submission is based on and informed by our years of research and advocacy on this issue. Since 2012, Human Rights Watch has published more than two dozen reports on autonomous weapons systems, most in conjunction with the International Human Rights Clinic (IHRC) at Harvard Law School. This research has explored the numerous serious ethical, moral, legal, accountability, and security challenges and concerns raised by weapons systems that select and engage targets based on sensor processing rather than human inputs.[2]

In November 2012, Human Rights Watch and IHRC released “Losing Humanity: The Case against Killer Robots,” the first major civil society report to examine the dangers of removing human control from the use of force.[3] This report – and later ones – found that allowing machines to select and attack targets without further human intervention would be incompatible with fundamental provisions of international humanitarian law, including the principles of distinction and proportionality.[4] Autonomous weapons systems would find it difficult to distinguish between combatants and civilians, particularly when the former commingle with the latter, because they could not interpret subtle cues. In addition, they would lack the human judgment to determine whether the expected civilian harm was excessive in relation to the anticipated military advantage in rapidly changing case-by-case situations.

Human Rights Watch and IHRC have detailed the significant hurdles to assigning personal accountability to the actions undertaken by autonomous weapons systems under both criminal and civil law.[5] Accountability is essential to deter future unlawful acts, punish past ones, and recognize victims’ suffering. In both armed conflict and law enforcement operations, there is an accountability gap for the harm caused by autonomous weapons systems. It is legally challenging and arguably unfair to hold human operators criminally responsible for the actions of autonomous weapons systems if they could not predict or control those actions. There are a range of further obstacles to holding weapons manufacturers liable under civil law.

Autonomous weapons systems would also contravene basic principles of humanity and the dictates of public conscience established by the Martens Clause under international humanitarian law.[6] The principles of humanity require humanity (including compassion) and respect for human life and dignity, neither of which autonomous weapons can express because they are inanimate objects. In addition, removing human control from the use of force crosses a moral red line for many and thus runs counter to their public conscience. Thousands of scientists and artificial intelligence experts, more than 24 Nobel Peace Laureates, and more than 160 religious leaders and organizations of various denominations have demanded a ban on autonomous weapons systems.

Autonomous weapons systems raise serious concerns under international human rights law because they are likely to be used in law enforcement operations as well as situations of armed conflict. Human Rights Watch welcomed the first UN report on autonomous weapons systems presented to the Human Rights Council in May 2013 by the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions Professor Christof Heyns of South Africa.[7] The seminal report recommended an immediate moratorium on what Heyns called “lethal autonomous robotics,” weapons systems that would select and engage targets without further human intervention.[8]

Research by Human Rights Watch and IHRC has found that autonomous weapons systems raise concerns under the foundational rights to life and to remedy and the principle of dignity.[9] Under the right not to be arbitrarily deprived of life in international human rights law, force may only be applied if it is necessary, a last resort, and proportionate. Weapons that operate without meaningful human control face challenges complying with all three parts of that test. A machine could find it difficult to determine if it was necessary to use force because as an inanimate object, it could not read subtle cues in people to determine whether they are true threats. The machines would lack human judgment to weigh the proportionality of an attack. While a human law enforcement officer may be able to avoid force by negotiating with a human who was perceived as a threat and defusing a situation, an autonomous weapon system would be unable to do this, and humans would be less likely to surrender to a machine. Autonomous weapons systems raise additional concerns, discussed above, about an accountability gap, which present challenges for the right to remedy.

Autonomous weapons systems would undermine the principle of dignity, a legal and moral concept, which implies that everyone has a worth deserving of respect. As inanimate objects, machines cannot comprehend or understand the value of human life or the significance of its loss. Allowing them to make life-and-death determinations thus strips people who are being targeted of their human dignity. In the process of determining whom to kill, autonomous weapons systems boil human targets down to data points. As Heyns noted: “To allow machines to determine when and where to use force against humans is to reduce those humans to objects…. They become zeros and ones in the digital scopes of weapons which are programmed in advance to release force without the ability to consider whether there is no other way out, without a sufficient level of deliberate human choice about the matter.”[10] Recent efforts to hardcode a threshold for civilian harm into automated systems have been inadequate and provide no constraint.

Security concerns noted by Human Rights Watch and IHRC include the risk of an arms race, the threat of autonomous weapons systems reaching the hands of states or non-state actors with no regard for international law, and a lowering of the threshold to war.[11] Because autonomous weapons systems would have the power to make complex determinations in less structured environments, their speed could lead armed conflicts to spiral rapidly out of control. Their use could foster crisis instability and conflict escalation.[12]

III. Ways to Address the Challenges and Concerns Raised by Autonomous Weapons Systems

A Legally Binding Instrument

As a member of the Stop Killer Robots campaign, Human Rights Watch endorses its call for the urgent negotiation and adoption of a legally binding instrument to prohibit and regulate autonomous weapons systems.[13] Autonomous weapons systems are a grave problem that can affect any country in the world so clear, strong, and global rules are essential. Those rules should be legally binding to promote compliance among states that join the treaty. Experience shows that a legally binding instrument can also influence states not party, and even non-state armed groups through norm-building and stigmatization of the most problematic weapons.

Only new international law will suffice to deal with the dangers raised by autonomous weapons systems.[14] Measures such as a voluntary code of conduct would only pave the way for a future of automated killing. Voluntary commitments such as the 2023 US political declarations aimed at ensuring responsible use of weapons systems that incorporate Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities are completely insufficient and provide no restraint.

As Human Rights Watch and IHRC have reported, relevant precedent for a legally binding instrument can be found in Protocol IV to the Convention on Conventional Weapons, which preemptively bans blinding laser weapons.[15] Indeed, threats to the principles of humanity and dictates of public conscience, as well as notions of abhorrence and social unacceptability, helped drive countries to ban blinding lasers through the protocol adopted in 1995. While blinding lasers are a narrower class of weapons than autonomous weapons systems, the parallels show that drawing the line on problematic emerging technologies through prohibitions is feasible and effective.

A legally binding instrument should be accompanied by national legislation and other measures to implement and enforce the treaty’s provisions at the domestic level. We agree with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) recommendation that the instrument “should require States Parties to take all appropriate legal, administrative and other measures, including the imposition of penal sanctions, to prevent or suppress any activity prohibited to States Parties under the instrument undertaken by persons or on territory under their jurisdiction or control.”[16]

Essential Treaty Elements

Human Rights Watch, IHRC, and others have outlined the essential elements for an international treaty on autonomous weapons systems, following precent provided in previous disarmament treaties, international human rights instruments, and international humanitarian law, which all offer models for the proposed provisions.[17]

A legally binding instrument should apply to all weapons systems that select and engage targets based on sensor processing, rather than human inputs. While the treaty’s restrictions will focus on a narrower group of systems, this broad scope will help future-proof the treaty and ensure that no systems escape review. The new treaty should include: 1) a general obligation to maintain meaningful human control over the use of force; 2) prohibit weapons systems that autonomously select and engage targets and by their nature pose fundamental moral and legal problems; and 3) include specific positive obligations that aim to ensure that meaningful human control is maintained in the use of all other systems that select and engage targets.

The concept of meaningful human control is fundamental to such an instrument because most of the concerns arising from autonomous weapons systems are attributable to the lack of such human control.[18] The concept of meaningful human control should comprise a combination of components, such as, but not necessarily limited to: 1) Decision-making components, for example, the ability to understand how the system works; 2) Technological components, including predictability and reliability, and 3) Operational components, notably restrictions on time and space in which the system operates.

A new treaty should prohibit the development, production, and use of systems that inherently lack meaningful human control over the use of force given the links between loss of control and the challenges and concerns discussed above. The treaty should also prohibit the development, production, and use of autonomous weapons systems that target people in order to prevent the use of weapons systems that strip people of their dignity, dehumanize the use of force, or lead to discrimination. It should cover weapons that always rely on data, like weight, heat, or sound, to select human targets. These prohibitions would help protect civilians and other non-combatants in armed conflict, and reduce infringements of human rights during law enforcement operations. They should apply “under any circumstances” to ensure that the provisions cover times of peace and war.

The treaty should also include regulations (positive obligations) to ensure all other autonomous weapons systems are never used without meaningful human control. It should outline affirmative steps states parties would need to take to cover systems that are not inherently unacceptable but still have the potential to be used to select and engage targets without meaningful human control.

There are other types of positive obligations common to international humanitarian and human rights law that may be useful to include in a legally binding instrument on autonomous weapons systems. For example, reporting requirements would promote transparency and facilitate monitoring. Verification and compliance mechanisms could help prevent treaty violations. Regular meetings of states parties would provide opportunities to review the treaty’s status and operation, identify gaps in implementation, and set goals for the future.

The Way Forward

In terms of negotiating fora, the Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW) has run its course after providing a forum for useful discussions and the development of support for a legally binding instrument over the years. After more than a decade, it is clear that negotiations of a new instrument in the CCW are impossible. It is time to step outside of that forum to one that can aim higher, move faster, and be more inclusive of countries that are not party to the CCW as well as of international organizations and civil society. Disarmament precedent shows that stand-alone and UN General Assembly-initiated processes are viable options in which committed, like-minded states, in partnership with other stakeholders, can produce strong treaties in 15 months or less.[19]

The world is approaching a tipping point on this topic as support for negotiating a legally binding instrument on autonomous weapons systems reaches unprecedented levels.[20] The Stop Killer Robots campaign’s Automated Decision Research project identifies more than 110 countries that have expressed their desire through national and group statements for a new international treaty on autonomous weapons systems.[21] Human Rights Watch supports the joint call issued on October 5 by UN Secretary-General António Guterres and ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric for UN member states to negotiate a new international treaty by 2026 to ban lethal autonomous weapons systems.

Human Rights Watch affirms our strong commitment to work with urgency and with all interested stakeholders for an international legal instrument to ban and regulate autonomous weapons systems.

(Johannesburg) – Candidates in South Africa’s forthcoming general elections have been scapegoating and demonizing foreign nationals, risking stoking xenophobic violence, Human Rights Watch said today.

On May 29, 2024, South Africa will hold general elections for the national and provincial legislatures. Among the campaign themes that have taken center stage is migration, in particular irregular migration, which is often accompanied by harmful and threatening rhetoric. While irregular migration has been a long-standing issue in South Africa, discourse around it has become more polemic as the country approaches the most contested elections since 1994.

“Politicians are using immigrants as pawns, without regard for their safety in an attempt to score votes ahead of the general elections,” said Nomathamsanqa Masiko-Mpaka, South Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch, “The Electoral Commission of South Africa, as an independent constitutional body which manages free and fair elections, should explicitly condemn the harmful rhetoric directed towards foreign nationals.”

The authorities should enforce the electoral code of conduct to address harmful anti-immigrant rhetoric by government officials and candidates who are not only addressing legitimate issues of border control and irregular migration, but are making foreign nationals targets of abuse.

Candidates are pushing a narrative not just that migration is out of control, but blaming undocumented migrants for the country’s ills and engaging in xenophobia, Human Rights Watch said. South Africa’s electoral code of conduct, which every candidate is required to abide by, prohibits language that provokes violence and requires candidates to speak out against political violence. In a country where xenophobic violence, including lethal violence, has been a persistent problem, rhetoric that scapegoats foreign nationals can all too easily spark violence.

In one example, the party, Rise Mzansi, in its January 20 manifesto, said it would “fix the asylum seeker system: stop its use as a de facto permit for economic migrants,” feeding into the narrative of bogus asylum seekers.

Herman Mashaba, leader of ActionSA, in a tweet in December 2023 stated that foreign nationals who run tuckshops use their businesses as illicit drug channels, destroying small businesses in townships and villages, and disrupting communities’ way of life.

On November 26, 2023, the leader of the Patriotic Alliance, Gayton McKenzie while speaking at the political party's 10-year celebration said of foreign nationals: “they must go home” contending that foreign nationals are responsible for crime, drug peddling, unemployment, and other problems. “We don’t want illegal foreigners here.”

Lesego More of the nongovernmental group, Democracy Watch Foundation, said that, “When you encourage communities to directly confront illegal immigration, this might result in violence and attacking illegal migrants.”

Government officials have also been stoking anti-immigration sentiment. Kenny Kunene, the deputy president of the Patriotic Alliance political party and the Johannesburg city member of the Mayoral Committee for Transport called for the “mass deportation of illegal immigrants who are staying in abandoned buildings that are taking rent” following an August 2023 fire in a building in Johannesburg’s central business district that killed more than 70 people. In the wake of the tragedy, many South Africans blamed foreign nationals, with some claiming that eviction laws protect criminals by making it difficult to remove people who are occupying buildings without authorization.

On April 10, the Cabinet approved a Department of Home Affairs (DHA) White Paper on Citizenship, Immigration and Refugee Protection with recommendations including withdrawing from the 1951 Refugee Convention and reacceding to it with reservations. The DHA minister, Dr. Aaron Motsoaledi, also said that limited resources might affect guaranteeing socio-economic rights to refugees, suggesting that long-established rights enshrined in the Constitution’s Bill of Rights as applicable to all, are now at risk.

“Migration issues are clearly being used to circumvent the real issues that are present in South Africa” Nyeleti Baloyi, advocacy officer at the Consortium for Refugees and Migrants in South Africa, told Human Rights Watch.

For years South Africa has been grappling with sporadic and sometimes lethal xenophobic harassment and violence against African and Asian foreign nationals living in the country, including refugees, asylum seekers, and both documented and undocumented migrants. In 2019, South Africa initiated a five-year National Action Plan to combat xenophobia, racism, and discrimination. Despite this, sporadic incidents of xenophobic discrimination and violence have continued.

Xenowatch reported 170 incidents in 2022 and 2023 and 18 between January and April 2024. The authorities have yet to hold to account people responsible for past outbreaks of xenophobic violence, including in Durban in 2015 and the 2008 attacks on foreigners that resulted in the deaths of more than 60 people.

The anti-immigrant rhetoric used by politicians during the election campaign risks fueling more xenophobic violence, jeopardizing the protections in the South African constitution and international law, not only for foreign nationals but for South African citizens, Human Rights Watch said.

“If South Africa is to confront xenophobic discrimination, harassment and attacks, then it also needs to address anti-immigrant rhetoric and abandon retrogressive migration policies,” Masiko-Mpaka said. “The government can address irregular migration without using electioneering to endanger foreign nationals.”",HIGH,20240506T091500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Nomathamsanqa Masiko-Mpaka, Herman Mashaba, Gayton McKenzie, Kenny Kunene, Nyeleti Baloyi",South African politicians and authorities,"Johannesburg, South Africa","Condemn harmful anti-immigrant rhetoric, enforce electoral code, address root causes of migration.","Scapegoating and demonizing foreign nationals, risking xenophobic violence during elections",South Africa,"Anti-immigrant sentiment, political opportunism, socioeconomic issues"

He survived the ethnic cleansing campaign perpetrated by Sudanese government forces and their allied militias, known as the “Janjaweed,” in the early 2000s. Many of his family members perished.

Ultimately, the atrocities and discrimination he faced as a member of West Darfur’s Massalit community led him to become a human rights defender – a person who documents human rights violations and helps gather evidence that could lead to justice. He went to law school and, afterwards, established a human rights organization named al-Juzur (Roots in English).

In April 2023, fighting broke out and quickly spread as the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), an independent military force, and allied militias fought Sudan’s army. In El Geneina, the capital city of West Darfur where Jamal lived, the RSF and affiliated militias, both of which include former Janjaweed, once again targeted people on an ethnic basis, echoing the atrocities of 20 years ago.

At first, Jamal and his colleagues documented the waves of attacks by the RSF and the militias. These forces attacked the predominantly Massalit areas of El Geneina, killing, raping, and torturing people as well as assailing people displaced by previous bouts of violence, and at times, destroying whole neighborhoods. The onslaught targeted Massalit and other non-Arab groups in a campaign of ethnic cleansing – with atrocities that amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity.

By mid-June 2023, the unrelenting attacks on Jamal’s community reached a crisis point and he fled for his life.

“I didn’t think I would survive this,” Jamal said.

West Darfur

Jamal faced discrimination from the beginning of his life. “We were ethnically discriminated against in the schools. We were targeted based on our skin color. We used to be beaten up when we spoke our mother [tongue], we were asked to speak only in Arabic,” he told Human Rights Watch from a refugee camp in Chad. His family lived in West Darfur, in the ethnically diverse state in western Sudan that Massalit people see as their homeland. At the time, Sudan’s federal government imposed an Arab-centric culture on everyone.

When I walked in, I found my friend Mudather in the southeast corner of the clinic. It was as if he was sleeping. He didn’t look like he was dead. He looked completely normal. But in fact, he was dead. When I arrived, they told me that he’d been shot in the back by a bullet. They told me he was shot with a DShK gun because the bullet was big. It went in, and it didn’t come out. Narration by Mohamed Osman, researcher, Human Rights Watch On April 15, 2023, war breaks out in Sudan. It marks an escalation of the power struggle between two military leaders who have vied for power since they jointly overthrew a power-sharing government in October 2021. The war pits the military against an autonomous force known as the Rapid Support Forces, or RSF. By April 24, 2023, the conflict spreads to El Geneina, the capital of West Darfur. The atrocities that follow are documented by Jamal and other local human rights activists with the aim of bringing those responsible to justice. Jamal Abdullah Khamis, Human Rights Lawyer from El Geneina I was at al-Sadaqa Clinic on April 24, from the first day of the events, with a group of my colleagues from our organization. We were working in the clinic. Our role was documenting violations against the injured and the dead. Everyone who was brought to the clinic we would document. The number, their names, (ethnic) backgrounds and information. We were documenting all of these things. Narration by Mohamed Osman, researcher, Human Rights Watch Jamal and his colleagues notice a pattern to the killings. The RSF and allied Arab militias were targeting doctors, lawyers and human rights activists. Majority-Massalit neighborhoods and camps for internally displaced people were also being systematically targeted. The violence feels all too familiar to Jamal and others in West Darfur state, who recall fleeing their home villages in the early 2000s after being attacked by the Janjaweed, the predecessor of the RSF. Thousands were displaced, including many Massalit people. They found refuge in the camps for internally displaced people that swelled the outskirts of El Geneina. The conflict then occurred against a backdrop of long-standing tensions over land and other resources between non-Arab farmers, such as the Massalit, and nomadic Arab communities who were starting to settle. On June 15th, 2023, RSF and Arab militias overwhelm the remaining Massalit-majority neighborhoods. Tens of thousands of Massalit and other non-Arabs try to flee central El Geneina for its northern suburb of Ardamata, where there’s a Sudanese Armed Forces base. The RSF and militias attack the convoy, injuring and killing men, women, and children. Jamal Abdullah Khamis, Human Rights Lawyer from El Geneina I was accompanying my (injured) friend, Yousef Haroun Kabello. Minutes later around eight militiamen appeared wearing RSF uniforms. There were others with them from these well-known Arab militias. They were arguing with people. They stopped the cars. They opened fire on us. They shot at the chests of children, women, old and young men. It was a harrowing scene. We thought about how to escape. But we needed a way to escape. How were we going to escape? They started chasing people down the valley and firing on people who were in the water. It was terrifying. We couldn’t go back or move forward. We hid in some grass and bushes on the edge of the valley. That was at dawn on (June) 15th before sunrise. Then a chance came to run back. In al-Majliss neighborhood we experienced something terrifying. When we were going down the street we saw bodies everywhere, of women and children. They were the bodies of people we knew personally. But you can’t stop and help someone who is dead in the street. We kept running because we were being chased. TEXT: The killings continue for several days in El Geneina and on the road to Chad, where tens of thousands of civilians, including Jamal, flee in search of refuge. Jamal Abdullah Khamis, Human Rights Lawyer from El Geneina I found someone I knew and said, “Let my friend Kabello ride with you, he’s injured. It’s not a problem, I’ll walk behind with everyone else.” He said, “My car is full, but he can get in.” After a while we were attacked. Bullets started showering us from all directions and people were being killed. A child of around nine years old, came to me crying hysterically and was holding on to me. While we were walking, we came to a big trench. But the militiamen probably saw us going in there, because they were nearby. They forced us out and started beating us, torturing us, and firing just over our heads. They were arguing about whether to kill us or not. Those who had belongings, they took them. I had my two mobile phones, a USB stick, and some cash. The nine-year-old child was lying down by my side. The beating and torturing intensified, they were using a metal rod, some sticks, and whips to beat us. We were lying on our stomachs, and he stood up. The young boy couldn’t handle it anymore. They shot him in the head, and his head exploded. He died immediately. A second group also started beating and interrogating us. They asked what tribes we were from. If you answered that you are Massalit, they would kill you immediately. I denied that I am Massalit even though I am Massalit. They pressured me, and I told them I am from the Bargo tribe. They brought someone to talk to me in the Bargo language and I replied because I know how to speak it. He said, “Brother, go.” We entered Chad. We were shocked to see Chadian officials in front of us. Chadian military uniforms are very similar to RSF uniforms. They were also carrying whips. They all had a whip and a gun. The RSF have the same. When our group ran towards them (the troops) they told us to stop running. We were surprised, and thought it was the RSF again. We ran back towards Adikong (in Sudan). The soldiers ran after us and said, “We are Chadian officials.” We weren’t convinced until we saw the Chadian flag on their uniform. “We’re Chadian officials. This is Chad, you are safe.” “Many of your people arrived here before you. Welcome.” I was very tired, and they took me to the hospital. When I was in the hospital, who did I find? The man who was with me. My friend Kabello that I helped into the car. He made it, and they took him to the hospital. That was our horrific journey. Despite the huge shock and gruesome massacres that happened in West Darfur, I still have a lot of hope. Life in refugee camps and abroad is very tough. It’s no place to live. I have hope that El Geneina will recover, and we will go back soon. That depends on rebuilding the justice system. We need justice to be carried out. We need the principles of human rights and international law. That speak of the dignity of human life and the dignity of people. If these are embodied in West Darfur, then there is hope that we can return to El Geneina. The international community should deploy a mission to protect civilians in Sudan. TEXT: The international community should also impose sanctions against those responsible for atrocities and establish an arms embargo on Sudan.

In 2003, armed groups from non-Arab communities in Darfur, including Massalit, revolted against Sudan’s authoritarian government. They wanted to end the government’s Arabization agenda, oppressive policies, and the economic and political marginalization of western Sudan. In response, between 2003 and 2005 government forces and Janjaweed militias, which recruited members from nomadic Arab communities who frequently fought with Massalit farmers over water and land, carried out an ethnic cleansing campaign against non-Arab communities, killing hundreds of thousands. The International Criminal Court indicted Sudan’s then-president, Omar al-Bashir, for the crime of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.

During this ethnic cleansing campaign, Jamal witnessed attacks on his largely Massalit village, and when he was 10, he saw his uncle ambushed and killed. “I lost so many family members from both my mother and father’s side, especially my father’s … [dozens] of them were killed during these wars and clashes.”

While he studied law at a university in Sudan’s capital, Khartoum, Jamal headed the Association of Students of Darfur and was arrested four times there for protesting massacres and discrimination in Darfur. After passing the international bar association exam, he returned to West Darfur, where he founded Juzur in El Geneina.

“I felt that my duty is to spend my whole life defending and fighting for human rights,” he said.

Renewed violence

In October 2021, two generals staged a coup in Sudan, ending a period of transition that was meant to lead to the emergence of a civilian-led government. Roughly 18 months later, on April 15, 2023, fighting broke out in Khartoum between the forces these generals controlled, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the RSF.

The RSF had been established nearly a decade before that to formalize the Janjaweed among other government militias. The RSF committed widespread abuses in Darfur and beyond since then.

“I woke at 7 a.m. in the morning on April 24. While I was brushing my teeth I heard [rocket fire] very close to my house, around 500 meters away,” he said. “It escalated quickly. Later we learned that clashes had erupted between the Sudanese Army Forces and the Rapid Support Forces.” The RSF headquarters was located near Jamal’s home in the al-Jamarek neighborhood.

Events escalated rapidly. Jamal said that the next day, the offices of several international organizations were raided. “Medical supplies, cars and ambulances were stolen from the Ministry of Health building. El Geneina Teaching Hospital and [the building with] blood banks were also broken into. Medical equipment and supplies were stolen by the militias and the RSF,” Jamal said. His home was attacked, and his family fled, leaving everything behind.

In the following days, these forces looted the market, burning shops, Jamal said. Juzur’s office was attacked as well; fortunately, no one was killed. A second attack on Juzur’s office roughly two weeks later, though, would leave one of Jamal’s colleagues dead, their library torched, and office equipment destroyed.

“April 27 was one of the bloodiest days,” he said. The RSF and militias attacked camps housing internally displaced people, as well as schools and mosques.

After the first four days of heavy attack, there was a lull in large-scale attacks, but the abuses continued. Jamal believed the forces were trying to besiege his community: “There was a siege around the city with snipers on the main roads of El Geneina, it was impossible to even go get food or drinking water. That was their starvation plan, to kill people out of hunger and thirst. If you tried to go out, you [would] get shot immediately.” The RSF and allied militias also set fire to water stations and destroyed wells.

On May 12, the attacks ramped up again. By now, most Massalit people in and around El Geneina had fled to be near the general secretariat, a government building, and the governor’s house, where Massalit self-defense forces had gathered. The crowding meant “very poor living conditions,” including the spread of measles, according to Jamal. This was “in addition to the huge numbers of wounded and injured people who couldn’t access the needed healthcare.”

From the onset of the fighting, the RSF and their allies targeted Massalit people and other non-Arabs. “They were also systematically hunting and targeting the activists, educated [people] and human rights advocates,” Jamal said.

Jamal and his colleagues from Juzur used paper and pen to document as many attacks as they could, inputting what they learned into the single laptop they shared. Twelve people killed while sheltering in girls’ schools. Five people, including a child, killed in a mosque. Eight people trapped and killed in their home. And on and on.



During seven weeks of attacks, the SAF were not there to protect the people of El Geneina. They had retreated to their headquarters in Ardamata, Jamal said, a short distance north of the city, on the first day of the fighting. Only the Massalit self-defense groups were left to protect the community and fight the RSF and affiliated militias, he said.



The Clinic

During the conflict, injured Massalit people only had access to a handful of volunteer-run makeshift clinics. At one of them, the Sadaqa clinic, Jamal said he and his colleagues documented the cases of people who were brought there – close to 1,000 deaths and 2,000 injuries from late April until mid-June. For their part, the activists from Juzur brought the doctors meals and water.

On May 14, Jamal’s friend, Mudather Abdallah Abdel Rahman, called to say he was injured, and he asked Jamal to come to another clinic, which Dr. Mohamed Adam Khatir had founded in his home. But as Jamal neared the clinic, he saw RSF fighters and ducked into a nearby house. The fighters fired their weapons into the clinic; screaming followed. Then silence. Jamal waited until they were gone and then went into the clinic. Twelve people were dead, including doctors he knew.

“I found my friend Mudather … sitting casually and resting his head on his hand as if he were sleeping. He looked very normal. I started calling his name to wake him up. I shook his hand and then his legs. Then I realized he was dead.”

In June, the attacks escalated in intensity. On June 14, the RSF and allied militias staged attacks across El Geneina’s neighborhoods. It was also the day West Darfur’s governor – a man who had met with Jamal and other activists to hear their concerns – was brutally killed, last seen in the custody of the RSF.

Also on June 14, the defenses staged by the Massalit fighters collapsed.

On the Run

Between late April and the end of June, an estimated 167,000 people fled from Sudan to Chad, the vast majority from West Darfur. As of early May 2024, over half a million had crossed.

After the attacks of June 14, 2023, tens of thousands of people in El Geneina decided to flee at the same time in a convoy, kilometers-long, heading north through the city and towards the Sudanese army’s military base at Ardamata, about six kilometers from downtown El Geneina.

Jamal had – repeatedly – decided to stay. “It [is] hard to escape and leave your family behind,” he said. “It [is] so hard to leave your country, we are very sentimental, we are attached to our homes and our people.”

But now, as violence consumed his city, he decided to flee.

He and his friend, Yousef Haroun Kabello, who was injured, took a car with acquaintances. But because of the crowds, the pace of evacuation was glacial.

“Some [people] were riding on donkeys’ and horses’ backs,” Jamal said. “Some were taking cars, some were going on motorbikes and rickshaws. Some injured people were being [transported] on wheelbarrows. Some people were walking while carrying their elderly and injured people on their backs. The street was narrow and crowded, people [were] moving in one long line.”

The throng’s size and slow speed left them vulnerable.

Shortly before sunrise, near the northern al Naseem neighborhood, people wearing RSF uniforms and allied militias appeared, ordering everyone in cars to get out. The armed forces shot out the car tires, then fired into the crowd. “They were shooting on … children, women, old and young men. Everyone,” Jamal said.

Jamal and Kabello ran and hid in a pharmacy. “We witnessed the massacre happening live, hundreds of people dropped dead and injured in front of us.”

They tried to run and cross a nearby wadi – Arabic for a seasonal riverbed – but were surprised to find it full of water – and Kabello couldn’t swim.

Hundreds of panicked people started fleeing into the stream, Jamal recalled. The armed men “shot them inside the water. Some people were shot before entering the water.” The armed men used machine guns, rifles, and Dushkas, a heavy Soviet machine gun, he said.

He and Kabello doubled back. “We found many dead bodies scattered everywhere. Some of them people we knew, but of course we couldn’t even stop or try to check on them.” They fled with three women, who, when they stopped to discuss a hiding spot, were shot from behind. Three male youths who went back to check on them were also shot.

Jamal, Kabello, and others switched direction from the army base, now heading west towards the Chadian city of Adré, about 35 kilometers from El Geneina. Jamal spotted a friend driving an uncovered truck carrying women and children, and he asked him to also take Kabello. “He said his vehicle was already full, but we managed to squeeze him [Kabello] in. But there was no place for me.” Jamal followed behind on the dirt road by foot.

Ambushed

Jamal and others in the crowd were far behind the Massalit fighters of the Sudanese Alliance when vehicles carrying RSF fighters and other militias appeared on the road on the western outskirts of El Geneina. “They opened fire on the crowds, and they killed [many] people.”

Jamal ran away, and a 9-year-old child, crying hysterically, ran after him, trying to grab him. When the child caught him, Jamal fell. He was exhausted. He told the child to run, but the child was too scared. Instead, they hid among small bushes.

RSF fighters found them and others, Jamal said, and took their phones and money, beating them with whips, iron bars, and the stocks of their rifles. At one point, the RSF ordered everyone – there were seven of them – to lie down, faces to the ground. “The beating and torturing intensified. The kid couldn’t stand that anymore, and he got up,” Jamal said. “They immediately shot him in the head.”

Eventually, the fighters released those who survived, and they hid again, only to be found by another group of RSF fighters. This group opened fire near Jamal’s hiding place to flush him out, shouting ethnic slurs referring to black people.

A fighter ordered Jamal to lie down, facing Mecca, the direction which Muslims face to pray. He ordered Jamal to say the Shahada, an Islamic declaration of faith one makes before dying, three times. Then the fighter asked Jamal if he’d like to be shot or have his throat slit.

“I said ‘shoot me.’”

The RSF fighter prepared his weapon for firing before asking, “Should I kill you or spare you?”

“I said ‘spare me.’”

And the fighter did.

They released the whole group. It was June 15, time for evening prayer, Jamal noted. It was also about to rain.

Fleeing to Chad

Jamal and five others decided that to survive they needed to get to Adré, Chad.

They waited until the deep of night to travel to better avoid more forces. None in the group had traveled to Chad before, but they heard you could see Adré’s lights from a distance.

They walked silently through the bush, avoiding roads.

They came to a mountain and saw a large group of people – there could be safety in numbers – but this group made noise and smoked cigarettes, so Jamal’s group left. They found water at the mountaintop, then descended the mountain and arrived in the Sudanese border town, Adikong.

They kept walking as the sun rose. They knew they must be close to Chad.

Suddenly, they saw two men in RSF uniforms to the west. The men called them over, but Jamal and the others ran in the opposite direction. “They started firing bullets above our heads.”

Then, ahead of them, they saw men with whips and uniforms that looked like RSF who also called out to them. In fear, they turned around again, to run back. But these men ran after them, saying they were from the Chadian army, showing them the Chadian flag on their uniforms, that this was the border to Chad. Once Jamal and the others realized they really were Chadian soldiers, they crossed the Sudan-Chad border to safety.

“They welcomed us and told us that we are safe … and told us that many of our people had arrived before us,” Jamal said.

Across the border, “we found community, they gave us biscuits, tea, and food,” Jamal said. People arrived in Adré barefoot, and people bought them new shoes.

“The solidarity they offered us was unmatched,” Jamal said. “I arrived in Douane Souq [market] barefoot. People began hugging me and crying, and military men were also hugging us and crying. They felt our agony, sympathized with us and offered us everything.”

Soon after, Jamal collapsed and was taken to the hospital. “There I found my friend Kabello! He made it safely, with another man from his group.” However, the sixteen other companions in the car, including the driver, had all been killed.

Jamal faced struggles in Adré. While new camps had been built for the influx of people from West Darfur, the quality of water and food was poor. People also feared that the RSF or Arab militias would infiltrate the camps. “We ran into militiamen in the Adré market,” he said. Jamal and others received threatening messages via WhatsApp and Messenger.

Still, he has hope. “I hope that [West] Darfur … will recover and become a safe haven for us, and [that] we go back in the near future.” But for this to happen, he believes, local, national and international organizations need to work together and end the conflict. It also requires the establishment of a justice system – he’d like to see a joint court operated by teams from Sudan, Africa more broadly, and the International Criminal Court – where perpetrators can be held accountable for the human rights abuses that they committed. Also, it’s not just the RSF and allied militias who should be condemned, he said, but also the Sudanese army for not protecting civilians.

This is what he’s waiting for: justice and peace for West Darfur and all of Sudan.

(Berlin, May 9, 2024) – The Georgian parliament’s introduction of a bill obliging certain nongovernmental groups and media outlets to register as “organizations serving the interests of a foreign power” threatens fundamental rights in the country, Human Rights Watch said today.

The bill, under debate since mid-April 2024, prompted harsh criticism from Georgia’s bilateral and international partners and led to some of the largest peaceful protests in the country in recent decades. There have been multiple, credible reports of unjustified police use of violence to disperse them. The bill has passed two readings and is scheduled for its final adoption the week of May 13.

“Georgian parliamentarians and government officials formally defend the bill as providing transparency, but they make no secret of its intended purpose,” said Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “By labeling independent groups and media as serving foreign interests, they intend to marginalize and stifle critical voices in the country that are fundamental for any functioning democracy.”

Parliament should reject the bill at its final reading. The government should ensure respect for fundamental rights to freedom of assembly and expression and effective investigations of all allegations of excessive use of police force.

The bill, the Law on Transparency of Foreign Influence, is nearly identical to a draft law the Georgian parliament tried to adopt in 2023 but withdrew following mass protests. In the new version, the ruling party, Georgian Dream, substituted the term “agents of foreign influence” with “organizations serving the interests of a foreign power.”

The bill requires nongovernmental groups and print, online, and broadcast media that receive 20 percent or more of their annual revenue – either financial support or in-kind contributions – from a “foreign power” to register with the Ministry of Justice as “organizations serving the interest of a foreign power.”

If adopted, the bill will impose additional onerous, duplicative reporting requirements, inspections, and administrative liability, including the equivalent of up to US$9,300 in fines for violations.

Georgian legislation already requires nongovernmental organizations to register grants with the tax authorities, including the amounts and duration of the projects, to benefit from certain tax exemptions. They also file monthly financial reports that include information on the number of employees and service contracts and income tax paid. Media outlets also file monthly reports on their income and expenses to the Communications Regulatory Commission. All information that the nongovernmental groups and media outlets file is public and anyone could request a copy.

The bill’s initiators and the ruling party leaders have made clear in public statements that they intend the law to be used against groups and media that criticize the government, advocate for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights, or engage in other work that irritates the authorities.

Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze justified the need for the bill by pointing to initiatives that criticize the authorities or challenge government policies, claiming that some civic groups tried to “organize a revolution” in 2020 and 2022, “engage in LGBT propaganda,” and “discredit the police, judiciary, and the Georgian Orthodox Church.”

Georgian Dream introduced the bill amid other efforts to restrict rights as the country heads toward parliamentary elections, scheduled for October. In late March, the ruling party introduced another bill that would restrict the rights of LGBT people and ban, among other things, “gatherings aimed at popularizing same-sex family or intimate relationships… and non-use of gender-specific terminology.”

Bidzina Ivanishvili, the Georgian Dream founder and leader, in a rare public speech on April 29, said that by introducing the “transparency law” now, the ruling party aimed to exhaust the political opposition in advance of parliamentary elections. He also vowed to punish the National Movement, the opposition party that ruled Georgia under Mikhael Saakishvili from 2003 until 2012. Ivanishvili also attacked Georgia’s political opposition and civic groups, painting the latter in one broad stroke as “having no homeland” and accusing foreigners of plotting to bring the political opposition to power through “non-transparent NGO funding.”

The bill’s supporters falsely allege that the bill is similar to the United States Foreign Agent Registration Act. But the US law does not equate receiving foreign funding, in part or in whole, with being under the direction and control of a foreign principal. It primarily regulates lobbyists and does not serve as a mechanism for weakening civil society organizations and media. Russia also uses this false equivalence argument to justify its draconian and abusive legislation.

Tens of thousands of people have protested the bill continuously in recent weeks, in Tbilisi and several other cities. On multiple occasions during especially large demonstrations in front of the parliament building in Tbilisi, police used tear gas, water cannons, and pepper spray to disperse mainly nonviolent protesters, including on the night of April 30, the eve of bill’s second reading. There were credible reports of police using rubber bullets at least once on the night of May 1.

Human Rights Watch spoke with three people, including a 17-year-old high school student, who were all beaten viciously by police in separate incidents the night of April 30 to May 1. They each said that multiple police officers at the protest grabbed them unprovoked, then kicked them to the ground, beat them for several minutes, and then detained them. The authorities charged them with misdemeanor disobedience or petty hooliganism and released them. If the charges are not dropped, the three will face trial.

Ted Jonas, a 62-year-old lawyer who has been living in Georgia for 30 years, had numerous bruises, including a black eye, abrasions, and a bloody nose. Forty-nine-year-old Vakhtang Kobaladze had multiple bruises on his back, chest, hand, legs, and jaw. The 17-year-old said that five police officers dragged him to the ground and beat and kicked him repeatedly, leaving him with head trauma, a broken lip, and bruises on his left eye and all over his chest, shoulders, back, and hands.

The Georgian Special Investigation Service reported receiving 80 calls to its hotline from protesters and journalists alleging police violence. It said it had initiated a criminal investigation.

The bill, police violence, and detentions triggered statements of concern and criticism within Georgia and from multilateral organizations and Georgia’s international partners. In a public statement, Georgia’s human rights ombudsperson said there were no grounds for the police to use pepper spray to disperse protesters at the entrance to parliament and that police used water cannons and tear gas without adequate warning or reason, as “the rally had a peaceful character and there was no reason to terminate it....” A statement by 10 Georgian civic organizations called on Georgian authorities to investigate “cases of disproportionate use of force by law enforcement officers” that night.

In a May 2 statement, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Volker Turk, urged Georgian authorities to “conduct prompt and transparent investigations into all allegations of ill-treatment” and urged Georgian authorities to withdraw the bill, [which] “… poses serious threats to the rights to freedom of expression and association.”

On April 16, Joseph Borrell, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, and Olivér Várhelyi, its commissioner for EU enlargement, jointly urged authorities to withdraw the bill, which if adopted, they said would “negatively impact” Georgia’s EU candidacy. On May 1, Borrell condemned the violence against protesters.

In a letter to the chair of Georgia’s parliament, the Council of Europe human rights commissioner, Michael O’Flaherty, asked parliament to refrain from adopting the draft law because, if adopted, it would “likely result in the stigmatization and discreditation of the civil society organizations.”

The draft law is incompatible with legal obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Georgia is a party. While certain limitations on the rights to freedom of expression and association are permissible under international law, the proposed bill far exceeds any legitimate interference with these rights, Human Rights Watch said.

In 2022, the European Court of Human Rights found Russia’s “foreign agents” law, which is similar to the Georgian bill, in violation of article 11 of the European Convention, protecting the right to association. The court ruled that creating a special status and legal regime for organizations that receive funding from international or foreign sources was not justified, and that such restrictions interfered with their legitimate functions.

(Jerusalem) – Israel is contravening the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) legally binding orders by obstructing the entry of lifesaving aid and services into Gaza, Human Rights Watch said today. Since January 2024, the court has twice ordered provisional measures requiring Israel to enable the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance as part of South Africa’s case alleging that Israel is violating the Genocide Convention of 1948.

On May 5, Israeli authorities closed the Kerem Shalom crossing after a Hamas rocket attack, and on May 7, they seized the Rafah crossing as part of its incursion in the area, thus blocking aid from entering and people from leaving Gaza via the primary crossings used in recent months. While Israeli authorities had allowed more aid trucks to enter in the preceding weeks and opened an additional crossing and a port for aid entry, the increase has been modest and nowhere near enough to meet the overwhelming need, according to United Nations and nongovernmental aid agencies. The groups said Israel continued to block critical aid items, and only a small proportion of the limited aid has been reaching northern Gaza, where it’s vitally needed.

“Despite children dying from starvation and famine in Gaza, the Israeli authorities are still blocking aid critical for the survival of Gaza’s population in defiance of the World Court,” said Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch. “With each day that Israeli authorities block lifesaving aid, more Palestinians are at risk of dying.”

On January 26, the ICJ ordered Israel to “take immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian aid.” In light of the “spread of famine and starvation,” the court imposed additional measures on March 28, ordering Israel to ensure the unhindered provision of humanitarian assistance, in full cooperation with the UN, including by opening new land crossing points.

The court’s March order required Israel to report to the ICJ on the implementation of the court’s measures within one month. However, as of May 2, Israeli authorities continued to obstruct basic services and entry of fuel and lifesaving aid, acts that amount to war crimes and include the use of starvation of civilians as a weapon of war.

According to the UN, the average number of trucks entering into Gaza through Kerem Shalom and Rafah crossings increased by only 24 trucks a day in the month following the order – from an average of 162 trucks a day between February 29 and March 28 to 186 trucks a day from March 29 to April 28. This is only about 37 percent of the number that entered Gaza each day before October 7, 2023, when 80 percent of Gaza’s population relied on aid amid Israel's more than 16-year-long unlawful closure.

Israeli authorities have blamed the UN for distribution delays, but, as the occupying power, Israel is obliged to provide for the welfare of the occupied population and ensure that the humanitarian needs of Gaza’s population are met.

In response to United States government pressure, Israeli authorities opened the Erez crossing – a checkpoint between Israel and northern Gaza – for aid deliveries on May 1, allowing 30 trucks to enter. It's unclear whether further trucks have entered via Erez since then. In April, they also began allowing some aid to come from Ashdod port, a seaport south of Tel Aviv. In an April 30 response to a High Court petition challenging the restrictions on aid, the Israeli government said that it was also planning on opening an additional northern aid crossing.

Despite these increases, on May 1, Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders or MSF) stated that essential items like oxygen tanks, generators, refrigerators, and critical medical equipment continued to be blocked, that very little of the aid is reaching northern Gaza, and that there is “no clarity or consistency to what is allowed into Gaza.”

In early April, Human Rights Watch researchers went to Egypt's North Sinai region, which borders Gaza, and spoke to workers for 11 UN agencies and aid organizations sending aid into Gaza. All said that Israeli authorities continue to obstruct the entry of aid via Egypt. They said that the amount of aid, despite recent increases, and the arbitrary rejection of critical items, meant that the colossal need for aid is not being met.

Aid workers said the Israeli authorities have provided no list of barred items and inspections staff are rejecting entire truckloads in an ad hoc manner with no explanation or possibility of appeal. “They refuse to give a list [of items that are barred from entry], saying it is an individual determination,” one said. Adding to the opacity of the process, they said that Israeli authorities generally don’t allow aid agency representatives to be at the checkpoints where aid trucks are being inspected.

Several people said that Israeli authorities, in some cases, bar items they consider “dual use,” which could be used for military purposes, but there is no clear list of what items are included. In response to a freedom of information request for lists of so called “dual use” items, Israeli authorities said that they were still using a list of dual use items that they had published in 2008. Tania Hary, executive director of the Israeli human rights organization Gisha, told Human Rights Watch, “We see them interpreting the list very broadly, which is nothing new, except it’s taking place on the backdrop of a humanitarian catastrophe.”

Since Hamas-led fighters attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, high-ranking Israeli officials have made public statements expressing their aim to deprive civilians in Gaza of food, water and fuel – reflecting the policy being carried out by Israeli forces. Other Israeli officials have publicly stated that humanitarian aid to Gaza would be conditioned either on the release of hostages unlawfully held by Hamas or Hamas’ destruction.

Israel’s Coordinator of the Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the military body responsible for coordinating humanitarian aid into Gaza, has complete control over what can be taken into Gaza. After being inspected in Egypt, humanitarian aid trucks must go through two Israeli-controlled inspection sites: Nitzana and Kerem Shalom. People interviewed said trucks often have to wait for days, and sometimes weeks, for inspections due to limited working hours and scanning machines, as well as additional inspection procedures added since the October 7 attacks in Israel.

One UN employee told Human Rights Watch that a truck full of medical supplies had been sitting at the border for a month awaiting inspection.

Aid workers said that Israeli authorities have rejected most items with solar panels, motors, some metal parts, and even items stored in wooden crates, irrespective of their content. They said items like generators, water filtration systems, and oxygen, are consistently rejected. If any single item on a truck is rejected, the entire truck is denied entry, several aid workers said.

Human Rights Watch wrote to COGAT on April 2 seeking comment regarding Israel’s obstruction of aid but has not received a response.

Several people said that some trucks had been rejected several times for unknown reasons. They said aid workers tried to guess what might have caused the rejection and modified the shipments accordingly, but they were sometimes rejected again. “It’s a mystery with rejections,” a World Food Program worker said. “It’s not consistent. Some of the same items that have been approved to go in before are then rejected later.”

Aid workers said that more than six months into the hostilities, agencies are now automatically filtering out key lifesaving items from the trucks, only sending in what they anticipate will be allowed entry. That means they leave out critical items, including generators to provide electricity for equipment critical to health, water, and sanitation; repair items for water and sanitation infrastructure; and medical equipment like x-ray machines, because they anticipate rejection.

Since November, aid agencies sometimes have submitted lists of aid items to COGAT for preapproval. However, even when preapproval was given, on many occasions the items were still rejected at the checkpoints. The World Food Program staff member said that in one instance, the United Nations Population Fund, an agency focused on reproductive and maternal health, had received preapproval to send a maternity clinic to Gaza, but Israeli authorities twice rejected it at the border without explanation.

Several countries have responded to the Israeli government’s unlawful restrictions by airdropping aid. The US also pledged to build a temporary seaport in Gaza. However, aid groups and UNofficials have said such efforts are inadequate to prevent a famine.

In its March provisional measures order, the ICJ stated, “there is an urgent need to increase the capacity and number of open land crossing points into Gaza and to maintain them open so as to increase the flow of aid delivery,” as “there is no substitute for land routes and entry points from Israel into Gaza to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of food, water, medical and humanitarian assistance.”

Israeli authorities should urgently open additional land crossings and lift bans on critical aid items. They should provide aid agencies with a list of banned items and provide specifications for items that are allowed under certain requirements. Inspectors should provide written explanations for any rejections and allow agencies to appeal rejection decisions, Human Rights Watch said.

On May 4, Cindy McCain, an American who is director of the World Food Program, said, “There is famine — full-blown famine — in the north, and it's moving its way south.” On April 22, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) reported that “1.1 million people face catastrophic levels of hunger.”

“Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians face famine and many risk dying of starvation following Israel’s continued disregard for the law,” Shakir said. “The countries that continue to send arms risk being complicit in Israel’s atrocities against the Palestinians.”",VERY HIGH,20240507T203000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Omar Shakir (HRW), Cindy McCain (WFP), Tania Hary (Gisha)",Israeli authorities,Gaza Strip,"Open additional land crossings, lift bans on critical aid items, provide clear item rejection criteria",Obstructing entry of lifesaving aid and services into Gaza,Israel,"Conflicts between Israel and Hamas, blockade of Gaza"

Ghana has been at the forefront of Africa in providing free education to its children. Now, as a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council, there is a crucial role it could play in making free education a reality for more children around the world. Members of the United Nations (UN) are being asked to support a new initiative—led by Luxembourg, the Dominican Republic and Sierra Leone—to create an international treaty that would guarantee all children an explicit right to at least one year of free pre-primary education and free secondary education.

The first step towards free education in Ghana was the introduction of tuition-free elementary education for children ages six to 12 in 1952, less than a year after Ghana achieved self-governance, and at a time when fewer than half of children of similar ages around the world were enrolled in school.

Then in 1961, shortly following independence, President Kwame Nkrumah introduced fee-free compulsory education for primary and middle school (as it was then called), although the government struggled at first to find the necessary resources to deliver on the commitment.

In 2008, Ghana became the first country in Sub-Saharan Africa to expand free education to the kindergarten years, guaranteeing two years of free and compulsory pre-primary education.

Then in 2017, President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo started the Free Senior High School programme. At the time, President Akufo-Addo observed that the cost of providing free education would “be cheaper than the cost of the alternative of an uneducated and unskilled workforce”.

Results

The results of this steady expansion of free education have been astounding. According to the latest statistics, Ghana now has the third-highest enrolment rate in Sub-Saharan Africa in both pre-primary and secondary school.

One study found that among the students first eligible to benefit from free senior high school, there was an almost 15 percentage point increase in completing secondary school.",LOW,20240508T171500Z,Members of the United Nations,"President Kwame Nkrumah, President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo",Ghana,Ghana,Support for international treaty to guarantee education rights,Insufficient access to education for children,Ghana,"Historical resource limitations, need for educational access"

The following questions and answers address the international legal framework applicable to violence and the use of force in the West Bank. Human Rights Watch in October 2023 published a question-and-answer document focused on the international law governing the hostilities between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups in Gaza following the October 7 Hamas-led attacks on Israel. On May 8, Human Rights Watch reported on the killings of Palestinians in the West Bank.

The West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip is an occupied territory (the Occupied Palestinian Territory) under international humanitarian law, also called the laws of war. This body of law addresses conduct by all parties to an armed conflict, including the means and methods of warfare and the treatment of people in custody, providing civilians and others with a set of protections. It recognizes the Israeli occupation as an ongoing armed conflict. The law of occupation, applicable to occupied territory, can be found primarily in the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, the Hague Regulations of 1907, and customary international law.

International human rights law also applies to Israel’s conduct towards Palestinians in the occupied territory. The United Nations Human Rights Committee, the independent expert body that interprets the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), has for example repeatedly found that states are bound to respect the human rights treaties they have ratified outside of their borders and specifically that “the provisions of the Covenant apply to the benefit of the population of the Occupied Territories.”

The International Court of Justice endorsed this view in its advisory opinion regarding Israel’s separation barrier, and stated that the ICCPR “is applicable in respect of acts done by a State in the exercise of its jurisdiction outside its own territory.” The State of Palestine has also ratified the ICCPR and other human rights treaties, reinforcing their applicability throughout the occupied territory.

Israel maintains that its human rights obligations do not extend to the occupied territory.

While the law of occupation permits occupying powers to impose security restrictions on civilians, it also requires occupying powers to restore public life for the occupied population. That obligation increases over time in a prolonged occupation, as the occupier has greater opportunity to develop responses that are more narrowly tailored to security threats and that minimize restrictions on rights. In addition, harm caused by the indefinite suspension of basic rights on the occupied population increases over time. Human Rights Watch has called on Israeli authorities, after more than a half-century of occupation, to fully respect the human rights of Palestinians, using as a benchmark the rights enjoyed by Israeli citizens.

The Palestinian Authority also has obligations to protect human rights in the West Bank and not to commit rights abuses and laws-of-war violations.

International humanitarian law and international human rights law provide distinct sets of rules that regulate the use of force. The particulars of a given situation determine whether to apply the rules regarding the legality of use of force applicable in law enforcement—governed by international human rights law—or the rules governing the use of force under the laws of war.

When Israel and Palestinian non-state armed groups engage in hostilities, as in Gaza amid the ongoing hostilities since the October 7 Hamas-led attacks, their actions are governed by the conduct of hostilities standards rooted in the laws of war, consisting of treaty law and customary international humanitarian law applicable in non-international armed conflicts. The treaty law, notably Common Article 3 to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, sets forth fundamental protections for civilians and captured combatants of both states and non-state armed groups.

However, when Israeli security forces, whether soldiers or police, perform law enforcement functions regarding the occupied population, international standards regarding law enforcement apply, including the ICCPR and the United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials.

In the West Bank, there are insufficient grounds at present to find that a non-international armed conflict is taking place between Israel and Palestinian armed groups. This could change if armed violence in the West Bank reached a certain level of intensity and armed groups in the West Bank displayed a sufficient degree of organization to abide by the laws of war. If and when Palestinian armed groups currently fighting in Gaza conduct military operationsin the West Bank, the laws of war would apply to fighting between those armed groups and the Israeli military.

In general, for there to be a non-international armed conflict, the hostilities would have to be conducted by force of arms and involve such intensity that the government would be compelled to employ its armed forces against opposing non-state armed groups. Factors to be considered in evaluating the intensity include, for example, “the number, duration and intensity of individual confrontations” and “the type of weapons and other military equipment used,” as well as “the number of persons and type of forces partaking in the fighting.” Factors to be considered in evaluating the degree of organization of the non-state armed group include the level of common leadership and purpose, the existence of a command structure, and the ability to plan, coordinate, and carry out military operations.

Based on these standards and research findings, Human Rights Watch has applied law enforcement standards rooted in international human rights law to analyze recent Israeli raids in the West Bank. Human Rights Watch used similar standards in its analysis of Israel’s use of force in 2018-19 against the “Great March of Return” demonstrations in Gaza along the fences that separate Gaza from Israel.

Even when applying law enforcement standards to the analysis of particular instances of use of force in the West Bank, certain protections of the laws of war also continue to apply because the West Bank is occupied territory.

The Israeli army carries out law enforcement in the West Bank, acting in a policing capacity. The law enforcement standards rooted in international human rights law therefore apply to its policing in the West Bank. These standards set out strict rules on the use of force and firearms by law enforcement officials. They prohibit the use of firearms except in specific situations, such as to confront “the imminent threat of death or serious injury” or “the perpetration of a particularly serious crime involving grave threat to life,” and “only when less extreme means are insufficient to achieve these objectives.” They provide that intentional use of firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable to protect life.

These standards prohibit security forces from intentionally using lethal force, including against members of armed groups, when there is no imminent threat to life.

During situations covered by these standards, willful killings of individuals by security force officers outside what is permissible under law enforcement standards are serious violations of the right to life as defined by international human rights law.

Israeli settlements are unlawful under international humanitarian law. However, Israeli civilians living in unlawful settlements in the occupied territory do not lose their protections under the laws of war. Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states that “the Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.” Indeed, it is because Israeli settlers are civilians that the act of transferring them to the occupied territory constitutes a war crime by the authorities carrying out the transfer. The fact that a person has willingly moved to a settlement or lives in one does not make them a legitimate military target.

Israeli civilians living in the settlements maintain the protections that the laws of war provide to all civilians. But when settlers or other Israeli civilians join in military operations with the Israeli army or engage in military operations as part of organized civilian security forces set up by municipal authorities in settlements, they may be “directly participating in hostilities.”

These civilian security forces fall under the operational responsibility of Israel’s Defense Ministry and army, as well as settlement councils, and, as per a 1971 military order, act “on behalf of the army.” They play a security role that extends beyond checking for identification and have the authority to use lethal force, similar to military forces. Israeli authorities distributed assault rifles to “civilian security squads” following the October 7 Hamas-led attacks in Israel, according to media reports.

When settlers actively take part in hostilities, they lose their immunity from attack and become legitimate military targets. Civilians lose their immunity from attack when and only for such time as they are directly participating in hostilities. Similarly, reservists of national armed forces, including in the Israeli army, are considered civilians except when they go on duty, in which case they are combatants subject to attack at all times, unless captured or incapacitated.

Even when individual settlers temporarily lose their protections as civilians because of their direct participation in hostilities, Palestinian combatants carrying out attacks against military targets need to take all feasible precautions to avoid harm to other civilians and civilian objects.

The same standards regarding direct participation in hostilities apply to the conduct of Palestinian civilians taking part in fighting alongside Palestinian armed groups during armed hostilities, as Human Rights Watch laid out in a 2023 questions-and-answers document published following the October 7 Hamas-led attacks on Israel

All states and non-state armed groups engaging in armed conflict have a responsibility to ensure that those within their chain of command obey international humanitarian law, including by protecting civilians. In addition, states have an obligation to investigate and appropriately punish serious laws-of-war violations and other crimes in violation of international law taking place on their territory or under their jurisdiction or committed by members of their forces.

Under the principle of command responsibility, individual military and civilian commanders may be held criminally responsible for war crimes committed by forces and subordinates under their effective command and control, where they knew or should have known the forces were committing war crimes and they failed to take all reasonable measures to prevent the crimes or submit the matter for investigation and prosecution.

International human rights law places obligations on government authorities and recognized non-state actors exercising functions of government to maintain law and order in accordance with human rights standards. These authorities have an obligation not to engage in, instigate, encourage, or incite discrimination, hostility, violence, or unlawful acts of force. This applies to Israeli and Palestinian authorities. They should take all lawful measures within their power to prevent unlawful attacks, not praise, honor, or reward such attacks, and should investigate potential wrongdoing and hold those responsible to account.",HIGH,20240508T041500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Security force officers, Israeli civilians, Palestinian armed groups",Israeli Security Forces,"West Bank, specifically Balata refugee camp and surrounding areas","Full respect for human rights, accountability for violations, end to unlawful practices",Violence and unlawful use of force against Palestinians,West Bank,"Prolonged Israeli occupation, ongoing hostilities, lack of accountability"

(Nairobi) – An Al-Qaeda-linked Islamist armed group killed at least 32 civilians, including 3 children, and set fire to over 350 homes in central Mali in January 2024, forcing about 2,000 villagers to flee, Human Rights Watch said today. Earlier in January, an ethnic militia killed at least 13 civilians, including 2 children, abducted 24 other civilians, and looted property and livestock in central Mali. These attacks violate international humanitarian law and are apparent war crimes.

Human Rights Watch documented two attacks by the Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims (Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wa al-Muslimeen, JNIM) on the villages of Ogota and Ouémbé, Mopti region, on January 27, and two attacks by Dozo militia on the villages of Kalala and Boura, Segou region, in early January. These attacks occurred amid recurrent tit-for-tat killings and communal violence in central Mali. Mali’s transitional military authorities, which took power in a May 2021 coup, should urgently investigate the abuses, fairly prosecute those responsible, and provide better protection for all civilians at risk.

“Islamist armed groups and ethnic militias are brutally attacking civilians without fear of prosecution,” said Ilaria Allegrozzi, senior Sahel researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The authorities need to act to end the deadly cycles of violence and revenge killings and better protect threatened civilians.”

Between February and April, Human Rights Watch interviewed 25 people by telephone with knowledge of the attacks, including 15 witnesses, 3 Malian activists, and 7 international organization representatives. Human Rights Watch also analyzed satellite imagery of burned homes in Ogota and Ouémbé.

Mali has been fighting Islamist armed groups linked to Al-Qaeda and the extremist armed group Islamic State (also known as ISIS) since 2015. In December 2023, the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), pulled out of the country at the request of Mali’s transitional military authorities, raising concerns about protecting civilians and monitoring abuses. In January, the transitional authorities announced that Mali would leave the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), depriving abuse victims of the ability to seek justice through the ECOWAS Community Court of Justice.

Witnesses said that on January 27 the JNIM attacked Ogota, populated mainly by ethnic Dogon, as retaliation for the presence of Dan Na Ambassagou militia in the vicinity. “They invaded the village, shooting at anything and anyone for more than an hour,” said a 40-year-old woman. “They set the whole village on fire.”

On January 6, Dozo militia attacked Kalala, a predominantly ethnic-Fulani village, and killed 13 civilians. “We found six bodies in front of the mosque, and the others inside homes or outside,” said a herder. “The Dozo targeted us because we are Fulani, and they think all Fulani are terrorists.” Witnesses from Kalala said the attack was retaliation for JNIM’s attacks against ethnic Bambara in surrounding villages in October and November.

Malian transitional military authorities have not adequately investigated incidents implicating members of Islamist armed groups or ethnic militias, Human Rights Watch said. In his February report, Alioune Tine, the UN Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in Mali, stated that he regrets “that no significant progress has been made in prosecuting the alleged perpetrators of multiple violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law attributed to violent extremist groups, militias and community self-defence groups and Malian forces.”

Witnesses to the JNIM attacks said that the Malian security forces failed to adequately protect their communities. “The Malian state has abandoned us,” said a 34-year-old man from Bankass, Mopti region. “Since 2018, the jihadists have imposed Sharia [Islamic law] on us, attacked our villages, mined our roads, [and] kidnapped our children. We have always called for help from our authorities, but there has been no response. These attacks continue because terrorists enjoy freedom of action and are never held accountable.” A witness to the Dozo militia attack in Boura on January 3, however, found the authorities willing to respond promptly, saying that local gendarmes “acted quickly … and arrested three militiamen.”

Human Rights Watch has also documented serious abuses by the Malian security forces and apparent Russia-backed Wagner forces during counterinsurgency operations in central Mali.

Under international humanitarian law, the fighting in Mali is considered a non-international armed conflict. Applicable law includes Common Article 3 to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and customary laws of war, which apply to non-state armed groups as well as national armed forces. The laws of war prohibit summary executions, torture, attacks on civilians and civilian property, and looting, among other violations. The government has an obligation to impartially investigate and appropriately prosecute those implicated in war crimes, which are serious violations of the laws of war committed with criminal intent.

“The Malian transitional government’s failure to hold Islamist armed groups and ethnic militias to account only emboldens abusive forces to commit further atrocities,” Allegrozzi said. “The authorities should ramp-up efforts to appropriately investigate and prosecute all those responsible for grave abuses.”

For witness accounts and other details, please see below. The names of those interviewed have been withheld for their protection.

Abuses by the JNIM

The Islamist armed group JNIM emerged in March 2017 as an umbrella coalition of Al-Qaeda-aligned groups, including Ansar al-Din, Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, al-Mourabitoun, and Katibat Macina. Human Rights Watch has previously documented serious abuses by the JNIM across Mali.

The JNIM has concentrated its recruitment efforts on ethnic Fulani, exploiting their frustrations over government corruption and competition over natural resources. This has exacerbated tensions between the Fulani and other ethnic groups, especially the Bambara and Dogon, leading to the formation of ethnic self-defense groups, such as the Dozo and Dan Na Ambassagou, which have taken protecting their villages and property into their own hands.

Ogota and Ouémbé, Mopti Region, January 27

On January 27 at about 6 p.m., scores of JNIM fighters armed with Kalashnikov-style assault rifles and riding motorbikes and vehicles mounted with heavy machine guns led simultaneous attacks on Ogota and Ouémbé villages, three kilometers apart, four witnesses said.

The fighters, who wore headscarves and spoke Fulfulde, a language widely spoken in Mali, killed 28 villagers in Ogota, including 8 women, 4 older men, and 3 children, and 4 villagers in Ouémbé, including 2 women. Witnesses said the fighters burned at least 150 homes in Ogota and 130 homes in Ouémbé, then returned on February 1 to burn the remaining intact homes.

On January 29, international media reported the attacks, citing information from local authorities. In a February 1 statement, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, said he was “alarmed by reports that about 30 civilians were killed in attacks by yet unidentified gunmen” on Ogota and Ouémbé, and called for an impartial investigation and for those found responsible to be “brought to justice in trials observing international standards.”

A 46-year-old farmer from Ouémbé said:

I saw the terrorists coming. They split into two groups: one headed toward Ouémbé, and the other toward Ogota. The group heading toward Ouémbé … was made up of about 20 motorcycles and a pickup truck with a machine gun mounted on top. The group heading to Ogota was larger. A few minutes after the convoy passed me, gunshots were heard from Ogota, then gunshots could also be heard from Ouémbé. The shooting lasted about an hour and a half.

Villagers said they believed they were attacked because some members of the Dan Na Ambassagou militia refused to lay down their weapons following a deal between the militia and the JNIM. The Dan Na Ambassagou is an umbrella organization of self-defense groups started in 2016 “to protect the Dogon country” that provided security in Ogota, Ouémbé and surrounding villages.

A 24-year-old former Dan Na Ambassagou militiaman from Ogota said:

At the beginning of the movement, we fought the jihadists, but in late 2018, we realized that the jihadists were better armed and that our involvement in the militia made our villages the targets of the jihadists. The jihadists cut off market roads, kidnapped our relatives, prevented us from practicing agriculture, and besieged our villages to the point that our children died of hunger. Some of us decided to negotiate with the jihadists and lay down weapons. However, some militiamen refused the negotiations, so our movement split into two: we accepted a deal with the jihadists, others continued to fight them. It’s because of those who kept fighting that our village was attacked.

Witnesses from Ogota and Ouémbé said that residents learned days earlier about an imminent threat from the JNIM. They contacted Malian soldiers based in Bankass and in Bandiagara, respectively about 40 and 70 kilometers from Ogota and Ouémbé, seeking protection, without success.

A 46-year-old farmer from Ouémbé said:

We have been living with the terrorists since 2018. When they have bad intentions against a village, they say it clearly in the WhatsApp groups. So, we contacted our relatives who are civil servants in Bandiagara asking them to inform the soldiers about the threats against our village and Ogota. They met with the military authorities in Bandiagara and told them that the terrorists were gathering in the bush at Bankass and that they planned to attack our villages. But the soldiers didn’t do anything.

Killings in Ogota

Villagers from Ogota said JNIM fighters came at sunset from the southern side of the village. They started shooting heavily from the top of a hill causing villagers to panic and flee. They then stormed the village, firing at people trying to escape or hide.

A 40-year-old woman said:

The jihadists spoke in Fulfulde language and shouted “Allah Akbar” [God is great]. They cheered saying the “enemy village has fallen,” and “this is what we are going to do with all the villages that do not respect Islam.” My husband fled as the shooting started, leaving me and my children in the house. Two women with their children came and hid with us. When the shooting stopped, we decided to leave, but as soon as we went out, gunfire resumed, I was hit in my legs and fell. The two women left me behind and ran with my children.… When the jihadists left, my husband came back to rescue me.

The former militiaman said that when the attack started, he phoned members of the Dan Na Ambassagou militia for help, “but they only came when the jihadists had already left.”

A 34-year-old man said:

When the attack started, I was about four kilometers from Ogota. I heard bursts of machine-gun fire for an hour and a half, and I saw flames coming out from the village. When the shooting stopped, I went back to Ogota and found some villagers and militiamen who were trying to rescue the injured.… The village was covered in smoke, and we could see dead bodies inside and outside homes. Some people had been shot while running, others were executed in their homes. Homes were still on fire. In one house, we found five bodies charred: one woman, a 50-year-old man, and three older men.

Human Rights Watch reviewed two lists of victims compiled by survivors and residents, with the names of 28 people killed, including 3 children under age 2, 4 men over age 68, and 8 women between 30 and 50. At least 5 of those killed appeared to have been shot in the head, 9 were burned, and the remaining were riddled by bullets, witnesses said.

“We buried the bodies the day after the attack,” said a 45-year-old farmer. “Some bodies had bullet wounds everywhere. Others, especially those charred, could not be lifted, so we buried them where we found them. The others were buried separately.”

Killings in Ouémbé

Villagers from Ouémbé described a similar scenario.

“I was home when I heard heavy gunfire,” said a 43-year-old farmer. “By the time I had gathered my family, I saw the terrorists coming in large numbers. They screamed ‘Allah Akbar’ and shot continuously. I fled to Segué.”

A 46-year-old man said:

We heard repeated gunshots and bursts of machine-gun ‘pa-pa-pa.’ I fled to the bush before the terrorists invaded the village.… When shooting stopped at night, I came back and found the bodies of four people, two men and two women, in a home where they were probably hiding.… They had been shot in the chest and the head. We buried them the following day.

Human Rights Watch reviewed two lists of victims compiled by survivors and residents, with the names of four people killed, two men, between ages 50 and 60, and two women, between 30 and 40.

Arson in Ogota and Ouémbé

Witnesses said that during the January 27 attacks, JNIM fighters set on fire at least 150 homes in Ogota and about 130 in Ouémbé, forcing about 2,000 villagers to flee. They also said that the fighters came back four days later to burn remaining homes in Ogota and Ouémbé.

“It was a ghost village,” said the 45-year-old man from Ogota who returned to the village after the attack and later fled with his family to Bankass.

“There was nothing left of the village,” said the 46-year-old man from Ouémbé who returned to the village after the attack. “People had fled, the houses were still burning. All the people have been displaced, including myself and my family. We are now in Bankass and lack everything.”

On satellite imagery that Human Rights Watch analyzed, burn marks are visible all over Ogota and Ouémbé villages. They first appeared over both villages on an imagery from January 28, 10:38 a.m. local time, and were not visible the previous day at the same time. Additional burn marks appeared over both villages on an imagery of February 1, 10:38 a.m. local time, that were not visible the day before.

Abuses by Dozo Militia

The Dozo, or “traditional hunting societies,” consisting mainly of ethnic Bambara, have acted as village self-defense forces in Segou and Mopti regions since about 2014. Human Rights Watch has previously documented serious Dozo abuses against Fulani civilians, as well as allegations that Dozo and other self-defense groups have acted as Malian army proxies.

Kalala, Segou Region, January 6

On the evening of January 6, Dozo militia attacked Kalala and killed 13 people, including 3 older men, one of them blind, an older woman, and 2 children, 3 witnesses said. They also burned at least one home, 10 huts, and 20 sheds.

Villagers believe that the Dozo attacked Kalala, with a predominantly Fulani population, in retaliation for JNIM attacks against ethnic-Bambara in several surrounding villages in late 2023.

A man from Kalala said:

Between October and November 2023, some people from Berta, Diado, Kéré, Goumba and Kafagou, which are mainly populated by ethnic Bambara, began arming themselves, breaking the deals they had made with the jihadists. The jihadists then chased them out of their villages. Those driven out of their homes organized themselves and attacked Kalala, a village mostly inhabited by ethnic Fulani. A Fulani village in our area is considered a jihadist village by other communities.

Witnesses said that scores of Dozo militiamen riding motorbikes, wearing distinctive brown hunting clothes and amulets around their necks, and carrying Kalashnikov-style assault rifles and hunting guns, arrived in Kalala after sunset. They stopped at the village football field and started shooting. They headed to the mosque and summarily executed at least six men.

A villager said:

When I saw a dozen Dozo heading towards the mosque, I hid in the mosque’s toilet.… The Dozo rounded up six men in front of the mosque and one Dozo shot each person in the head. I watched the scene from the door [of the toilet]. Among the six were the village chief, the muezzin [who makes the call to the daily prayer], an 83-year-old blind man, and an 80-year-old man.

Witnesses said that, after the killings, the Dozo went door-to-door, looting, burning huts and other properties, and killed seven more people.

A 45-year-old woman said:

I bumped into two Dozo militiamen. One asked me: “Where are your children and your husband?” I replied that my children were not around and that my husband is visually impaired, I begged them to have mercy on us.… They left but set fire to the shed in front of the house.… My husband told me to leave him behind and flee.… I joined 20 other women and children. We walked through the bush at night.… At 6 a.m., we split, some went east, toward Tionce; others went west, toward Saye. I went to Kalala Bamara where a woman helped me and took me in her wheelbarrow back to my village to look for my husband.

The woman said that when she arrived in the village, she saw the bodies of 13 people. “Some [were] shot in the head,” she said, and “the village had been looted” with “several huts and sheds burned.” She found her husband alive and fled with him to Saye.

A man who helped bury the bodies in Kalala said:

We could not bury our relatives for many days because we feared more attacks by the Dozo. On February 3, we decided to go back and found that the bodies of the six men killed in front of the mosque had already been buried in a mass grave, which was uncovered. We don’t know who dug it, but we think the jihadists [JNIM] did it. We just covered it with sand, buried the seven other bodies, and left in a hurry.

Human Rights Watch obtained three lists of victims compiled by survivors and Kalala residents, with 13 names of people between ages 4 and 83. Among those killed, witnesses said, was the village chief and an older woman whose charred body was found in her house.

Boura, Segou Region, January 3

On January 3 at about 8 a.m., scores of Dozo militiamen, riding at least 100 motorbikes, stormed the village of Boura, abducting 24 people, including the 72-year-old village chief, three witnesses said. They also looted homes and livestock.

Witnesses said that the Dozo came from the locality of Ndokoro, 14 kilometers away, and attacked the predominantly ethnic Fulani village. Since late 2023, JNIM had abducted Dozo militiamen in several villages surrounding Boura.

“At the beginning of 2023, the army patrolled our area, so the jihadists suspected that the Dozo were collaborating with the military,” said a 40-year-old woman. “The jihadists then started to kidnap some Dozo. And in retaliation, the Dozo attacked our village.”

Human Rights Watch has previously reported allegations that Dozo and other self-defense groups acted as Malian army proxies.

Witnesses said that the militiamen came with motorbikes, wore distinctive brown hunting clothes and amulets, and carried Kalashnikov-style assault rifles. They said the assailants went door-to-door looking for men and looting homes.

The 40-year-old woman said:

My husband was able to escape. I tried to escape too with my children, but the village was already cordoned off. I went back home and prayed to God. Two Dozo came to my house, asked me where my husband was. I said he wasn’t there. They broke into the house and forced me to give them my silver jewelry.… At about 10 a.m., they left the village.… Everything had been looted. All the men had fled. Only the women and children remained.

Human Rights Watch reviewed a list compiled by survivors and Boura residents with the names of the people abducted, including 23 men, ages 18 to 80, and a 17-year-old boy.

A 50-year-old man, who fled at the Dozo’s arrival, said he went to Segou city, 140 kilometers away:

I went to the gendarmerie to inform the gendarmes that our village had been attacked by a hundred of the Dozo who looted the village, took our animals, and kidnapped people. The gendarmes registered my complaint.… The gendarmes acted very quickly and went to seal off the road connecting Segou to our village.… The following day, the gendarmes were able to stop a truck carrying our looted animals, more than 60 cows, and arrested three Dozo.

Witnesses said that family members of those abducted did not look for their loved ones out of fear of attacks by the Dozo. “Some people told us that they had been killed, but none found their bodies and there is no evidence of that,” said the 40-year-old woman. The 50-year-old man who reported the attack to the gendarmerie said he also informed gendarmes about the abductions, but “we still have no news.”",VERY HIGH,20240508T063000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Ilaria Allegrozzi (HRW senior researcher), Alioune Tine (UN Expert)",Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims (JNIM) and Dozo militia,Ogota and Ouémbé in Mopti region; Kalala and Boura in Segou region,Malian transitional government to investigate abuses and protect civilians,"Mass killings, arson, and abduction of civilians",Mali,Ethnic tensions and power vacuums due to political instability

Journalists and human rights activists in Nigeria are protesting the arrest and detention of Daniel Ojukwu, a reporter at the Foundation for Investigative Journalism, who went missing in Lagos on May 1. He was later discovered to be in police custody, accused of violating Nigeria’s cybercrimes law.

The authorities have since moved Ojukwu between various police units, including the National Cyber Crimes Center and the Force Criminal Investigations Department in Abuja, the nation’s capital. Nigeria’s constitution requires that anyone suspected of a crime be charged before a court within 48 hours of arrest. Ojukwu has been in detention without charge for more than nine days.

The Foundation for Investigative Journalism said thatOjukwu was arrested over an online report he authored in November, alleging that Adejoke Orelope-Adefulire, a former senior special assistant to the president on sustainable development goals, transferred 147 million naira (about US$106,000) of government funds marked for school construction into a restaurant’s bank account.

Nigeria’s cybercrimes law makes a broad range of online interactions a criminal offense. Several activists and journalists have been arrested and charged under the law. The Economic Community of West African States’ (ECOWAS) Court of Justice in 2022 ruled that certain provisions of the law should be amended, citing violations of the rights to freedom of expression and information.

In February, the government amended the law, but the Committee to Protect Journalists and others contend that the amendments are not extensive enough to prevent the law from being used for censorship and intimidation. In particular, section 24 of the law vaguely criminalizes messages sent with the intention of “causing a breakdown of law and order [or] posing a threat to life.”

Nigeria’s constitution, along with international and African human rights conventions, protects press freedom and the right to free expression. Nigerian authorities are obligated to respect such rights by allowing criticism of the government without fear of retaliation, censorship, or legal sanctions.

The detention of a journalist for doing his job is a violation of these rights. The authorities should immediately and unconditionally release Ojukwu if he has not been charged with a criminal offense.",HIGH,20240509T234500Z,Journalists and human rights activists,Adejoke Orelope-Adefulire,Nigerian authorities,"Lagos, Nigeria",Immediate and unconditional release of Daniel Ojukwu if not charged,Unlawful arrest and detention of journalist Daniel Ojukwu without charge,Nigeria,Vague provisions in cybercrimes law; suppression of press freedom

(London, May 10, 2024) – Germany’s government needs to explain publicly if it has imposed a Schengen-wide entry ban on a prominent British-Palestinian surgeon and academic, Dr. Ghassan Abu Sittah, and, if so, the reasons why, Human Rights Watch said today. Dr. Abu Sittah has in recent weeks been denied entry to Germany and France and, on May 9, 2024, Dutch officials informed the Palestinian Ambassador to the Netherlands that Dr. Abu Sittah would not be allowed to enter the country on May 15 for an event at the Palestinian Embassy in The Hague.

Dr. Abu Sittah was denied entry to France on May 4, 2024, where he was due to speak about Gaza at the French Senate. He said on social media and to Human Rights Watch that French authorities at Charles de Gaulle airport informed him that he was barred from entering due to a year-long ban imposed by Germany. Dr. Abu Sittah’s lawyer told Human Rights Watch that German authorities had not informed him about the ban, nor disclosed the basis for it. A French official told the Associated Press that Germany’s entry ban applied across the Schengen area, a 29-country zone where internal border controls have generally been removed.

“Dr. Ghassan Abu Sittah has seen first-hand the atrocities taking place in Gaza,” said Yasmine Ahmed, UK Director at Human Rights Watch. “Germany should immediately explain why it has denied him entry and imposed this far-reaching ban on a leading health professional to speak in Berlin, Paris, and The Hague about what he witnessed in Gaza.”

The attempts to prevent him from sharing his experience treating patients in Gaza risks undermining Germany’s commitment to protect and facilitate freedom of expression and assembly and to nondiscrimination, Human Rights Watch said.

On April 24, Human Rights Watch wrote to the German government asking for an explanation of how its actions are consistent with Germany’s international and domestic obligations to protect and facilitate freedom of expression and assembly and nondiscrimination. Human Rights Watch has not received a response.

The Palestinian Ambassador to the Netherlands invited Dr. Abu Sittah to speak at an event in The Hague on the 76th anniversary of Nakba Day, which commemorates the more than 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes and the more than 400 villages destroyed in the events surrounding the establishment of Israel in 1948. The director-general of The Hague-based intergovernmental Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) also invited Dr. Abu Sittah in May to provide a briefing on the use of white phosphorus by Israeli forces in Gaza. Dr. Abu Sittah said that he witnessed the use of white phosphorus munitions, which cause especially harmful injuries, while working in Gaza.

Dr. Abu Sittah said that the Dutch officials informed the Palestinian Ambassador to the Netherlands that he would not be permitted to enter the Netherlands for the Nakba Day event on May 15, but they would consider allowing him to enter for the meeting with the director-general of the OPCW on the condition that he only attend that meeting and leave immediately thereafter. On May 09, the Palestinian Mission to the Netherlands announced that they cancelled the event due to the Schengen-wide entry ban against Dr. Abu Sittah. The announcement states that Dr. Abu Sittah was also scheduled to meet with international organizations, civil society actors, Dutch members of Parliament, and universities.

Dr. Abu Sittah had planned to speak to the French Senate at the invitation of Green Party parliament members at a meeting about France’s responsibility for the application of international law in Palestine. Dr. Abu Sittah spoke at the meeting via video link.

Germany blocked Dr. Abu Sittah from entering the country on April 12 to deliver a speech at a Palestine conference in Berlin. He said German officials told him that if he were to attempt to participate in the conference remotely or if he sent in a video message to the conference, that would be a criminal offense for which he could be fined or imprisoned for up to one year. He told Human Rights Watch that the airport authorities told him that they were refusing him entry due to “the safety of the people at the conference and public order.” Dr. Abu Sittah said he plans to challenge the Schengen-wide entry ban in Germany.

Freedom of expression and peaceful assembly can only be restricted in limited circumstances, and the enjoyment of these rights cannot be subject to any discrimination, for example on the basis of ethnicity, religion, or political opinion. Any restriction must not put in jeopardy the right itself.

The UK and Scottish governments should press the German government to explain the legality of banning the British surgeon from entering its territory and imposing a Schengen-wide visa ban, Human Rights Watch said. The German government should also immediately clarify the reasons for, and process followed, in imposing such a ban.

Dr. Abu Sittah treated patients at al-Shifa and al-Ahli hospitals in Gaza in October and November 2023. He has provided evidence about what he witnessed in Gaza to the Metropolitan Police War Crimes Unit in London. The UK Police have said that they would pass any relevant information on to the International Criminal Court (ICC) as appropriate.

The ICC prosecutor confirmed that his office has, since March 2021, been conducting an investigation into alleged atrocity crimes committed in Gaza and the West Bank since 2014, and that his office has jurisdiction over crimes in the current hostilities between Israel and Palestinian armed groups that covers unlawful conduct by all parties.

The reported travel ban on Dr. Abu Sittah may hinder his ability to provide information about crimes in Gaza to other judicial authorities and bodies across Europe, Human Rights Watch said.

Following the Hamas-led October 7 attacks in southern Israel that included deliberate killings of civilians and taking civilians hostage, acts that amount to war crimes, Israeli forces have carried out repeated apparently unlawful attacks, including on medical facilities, personnel, and hospitals in Gaza. Israeli forces continue to block the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance into Gaza, acts that amount to war crimes, including the use of starvation of civilians as a weapon of war.

“In the midst of ongoing atrocities in Gaza, countries should be prioritizing ending complicity and promoting accountability,” Ahmed said. “Instead, Germany, in blocking Dr. Abu Sittah from sharing his experience, is trying to block citizens from even hearing about the grave abuses taking place in Gaza. The UK government should immediately raise the reported ban with their German counterparts.”",HIGH,20240510T053000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Dr. Ghassan Abu Sittah, Yasmine Ahmed (UK Director at Human Rights Watch), Palestinian Ambassador to the Netherlands",German Government,"Germany, France, and the Netherlands",Urgent clarification from German government and support from UK and Scottish governments to challenge the ban,Imposition of a Schengen-wide entry ban on Dr. Ghassan Abu Sittah,Germany,"Political tensions regarding Palestinian issues, Germany's response to public health professionals discussing war crimes"

This week, United States President Joe Biden announced that his administration has “held up” at least one shipment of 3,500 bombs and artillery shells to Israel, saying the US wouldn’t transfer certain weapons to Israel if it proceeded with an assault on the city of Rafah’s densely populated areas.

This partial pause on weapon transfers doesn’t go far enough in response to Israel’s international law violations and US rules on arms transfers. Nonetheless, Biden’s decision represents a shift from the unconditional support the US has offered Israel, particularly since Biden acknowledged that “civilians have been killed as a consequence of those bombs and other ways [Israel] goes after population centers.”

Biden should resist congressional opposition to the pause and go further. Immediately stopping all transfers of arms and military support would be consistent with the US’s international and domestic legal obligations.

Since November, Human Rights Watch has called for the suspension of arms transfers to Israel and Palestinian armed groups given the real risk that weapons would be used to commit grave abuses. Providing weapons that knowingly and significantly would contribute to unlawful attacks can make those providing them complicit in war crimes. Other human rights organizations and dozens of United Nations human rights experts have echoed with their own calls to stop transfers to Israel.

Recently, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) considered Nicaragua’s legal challenge to bar Germany’s military assistance to Israel, among other things. The ICJ declined that request based on Germany’s assertion that it was not exporting any “war weapons” for use by Israeli forces. However, the court allowed the case to move forward and left the door open for a different outcome if Germany begins providing more “war weapons,” language that two legal scholars have characterized as “might hang like a sword of Damocles over States providing military support to Israel.”

Several of the US’s Western allies have already revised their policies of supplying weapons to Israel. In March, Canada announced it would cease future arms exports to Israel. Italy and Spain also stopped new licenses.

Legal action has also effected changes in state policies. In the Netherlands, a lawsuit forced the government to pause sales of F-35 fighter jet parts. In Germany, civil society groups filed a similar suit seeking to stop weapon sales.

Mounting public and legal pressure is making it harder for governments such as the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Denmark to continue selling arms to Israel. Biden’s shift in tone will add to the pressure. In the face of continuing atrocities, “full-blown famine” in northern Gaza, and Israel’s obstruction of aid for Gaza, these countries need to stop sending weapons now.",HIGH,20240511T003000Z,Human Rights Watch and other human rights organizations,"US President Joe Biden, UN human rights experts, legal scholars",Israeli government,"Gaza, specifically Khan Yunis and Rafah",End all arms transfers to prevent complicity in war crimes; respond to humanitarian crisis in Gaza,Violations of international law through military operations in densely populated areas,Israel,Ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestinian armed groups

Lawyers representing clients in politically motivated cases or speaking out on rights abuses face systematic and widespread repression in Belarus.

Belarusian authorities took control over the legal profession, eroding its independence; bar associations became the vehicle of the government’s agenda and repression.

Belarus should stop all politically motivated action against lawyers and create a normal working climate for them to exercise their professional duties.



(Vilnius, May 27, 2024) – Belarusian authorities have unrolled systematic and widespread repression targeting lawyers who represent clients in politically motivated cases or who shed light on rights abuses, Human Rights Watch, the Belarusian Association of Human Rights Lawyers, and the Right to Defence Project said in a report released today.

The 95-page report, “‘I Swear to Fulfill the Duties of Defense Lawyer Honestly and Faithfully’: Politically Motivated Crackdown on Human Rights Lawyers in Belarus,” documents the near complete government takeover of the legal profession in Belarus and repression against human rights lawyers by Aliaksandr Lukashenka’s government.

“By systematically retaliating against human rights lawyers, undermining their rights, and violating the rights of their clients in politically motivated cases, Belarusian authorities have turned the judicial system into a mockery of justice and deprived Belarusians of their right to a fair trial and equal protection under the law,” said Anastasiia Kruope, assistant Europe and Central Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Belarus should put an end to politically motivated prosecutions of lawyers and reinstate the independence of the legal profession.”

Between September 2023 and April 2024, Human Rights Watch interviewed 19 Belarusian lawyers and analyzed the publications on the bar associations’ websites over the past three years. Together with the Belarusian Association of Human Rights Lawyers and Right to Defence Project, Human Rights Watch also analyzed more than 140 cases of lawyers losing their licenses based on publicly available data and interviews and found a pattern of arbitrary and politically motivated license revocation.

The government’s targeting of human rights lawyers is a part of a wider government-led crackdown on any form of dissent, which swept the country in the run-up to and following the 2020 presidential elections and mass public protests against Lukashenka’s moves to secure the presidency for a sixth consecutive term.

In its 2023 and 2024 reports, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights found that Belarusian authorities’ violations, as a part of their efforts to eviscerate all forms of dissent, “may amount to crimes against humanity,” including the “crime of persecution.”

In Belarus, lawyers are a lifeline for their clients who are prosecuted for the peaceful exercise of their rights or for attempting to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms. Clients in such cases face serious rights violations, including torture and other forms of ill-treatment, and are often held in harsher conditions than the rest of the prison population.

Belarusian authorities create numerous obstacles to prevent lawyers from effectively carrying out their professional duties from the moment they take on a politically motivated case. The authorities deny lawyers access to their clients and eavesdrop on and record confidential attorney-client conversations. The authorities also undermine the defense by forcing lawyers to sign broad nondisclosure agreements and arbitrarily closing trials to the public, which prevents lawyers from sharing case materials with independent experts or exposing serious rights violations against their clients to the public.

For the first time in contemporary Belarusian history, lawyers are being imprisoned on political charges in retaliation for representing their clients in politically motivated cases. At least six lawyers—Maksim Znak, Aliaksandr Danilevich, Vital Brahinets, Anastasiya Lazarenka, Yuliya Yurhilevich, and Aliaksei Barodka—are currently serving sentences ranging from 6 to 10 years on bogus politically motivated charges.

Since September 2020, Belarusian authorities have arbitrarily arrested at least 23 lawyers and then used those arrests as a pretext to suspend them from representing their clients in politically motivated cases and to revoke their licenses. Many lawyers have been arbitrarily detained and interrogated and experienced other harassment and threats.

“Despite all the government’s efforts, Belarusian human rights lawyers have refused to end their work just because their licenses are revoked,” said Maryia Kolesava-Hudzilina, president of the Belarusian Association of Human Rights Lawyers. “Even from exile, our lawyers continue the fight, using international protection mechanisms to seek accountability for human rights abuses in Belarus.”

In violation of international principles protecting the independence of the bar, the Justice Ministry exercises full control over the legal profession in Belarus by overseeing the admission of lawyers into the profession, with the authority to revoke lawyers’ licenses, regulate the way lawyers discharge their duties, and strip lawyers’ self-governing bodies of all vestiges of independence. President Lukashenka has said that the work of lawyers should be viewed as that of a “statesman,” carrying out the tasks assigned by the state and protecting its interests.

In light of the control exercised over the formation of the Belarusian bar’s executive bodies and their work, the Belarusian Republican Bar Association and the regional bar associations cannot be considered independent self-governing bodies representing the interests of all lawyers in Belarus, the groups said.

Following major 2021 amendments to the Law on the Bar and Practice of Law in the Republic of Belarus, lawyers can no longer work individually or open law firms. Instead, they are required to join legal consultation offices, which are created and supervised by regional bar associations in coordination with the Justice Ministry.

The Belarusian government should immediately stop politically motivated prosecutions, end all harassment and attacks on lawyers, and ensure that they can discharge their duties without interference or fear of reprisal. The Belarusian bar should end politically motivated retaliation against its members, protect the interests of lawyers and their clients, and uphold the independence of the legal profession.

International actors should call on Belarusian authorities to adhere to their international obligations, stop using the judiciary as a repressive tool, release all political prisoners, and ensure that Belarusian lawyers face no obstacles in carrying out their professional duties in the best interests of their clients.

“Belarusian bar associations failed to protect the legal profession in Belarus and became the vehicle of the state’s agenda and repression,” said Maksim Palavinka, expert with the Right to Defence Project. “Instead, they became a reliable tool of the state and have shown themselves more than willing to participate in politically motivated retaliation against lawyers by the authorities.”",VERY HIGH,20240527T063000Z,"Human Rights Watch, Belarusian Association of Human Rights Lawyers, Right to Defence Project","Maksim Znak, Aliaksandr Danilevich, Vital Brahinets, Anastasiya Lazarenka, Yuliya Yurhilevich, Aliaksei Barodka",Belarusian authorities,"Minsk, Belarus","End politically motivated prosecutions, uphold lawyers' independence, ensure protection for lawyers and their clients",Systematic and widespread repression against lawyers,Belarus,Government takeover of the legal profession and repression of dissent

Several EU member states are gathering in Madrid this week for the Amsterdam Declarations Partnership (ADP) summit, an alliance of European countries committed to eliminating deforestation in agricultural supply chains by 2025.

Their leadership is sorely needed.

As multiple elections loom across Europe, some politicians have tried to score political points by attacking environmental regulations that are desperately needed to stave off the climate crisis. One of their targets has been the European Union’s Deforestation-Free Products Regulation (EUDR).

The law is intended to address Europe’s oversized role in driving deforestation around the world. Adopted last summer, the European Commission and member states have begun preparing for its implementation. Businesses will have to start complying in January 2025.

The EUDR requires EU companies to ensure the wood, palm oil, soy, coffee, cocoa, rubber, and cattle they import or export isn’t produced on land deforested after December 31, 2020. European companies must also ensure these commodities are produced in conditions that comply with laws on land use rights, labor rights, and other human rights.

The EUDR is urgently needed. In 2023, the world lost the equivalent of almost 10 soccer fields of climate-critical forest per minute. The cause is clear: commercial-scale agriculture is by far the single largest driver of deforestation worldwide and the global trade in the seven commodities targeted by the EUDR is among the main culprits.

While the bulk of deforestation happens in the tropics, EU companies purchase millions of tons of products grown in tropical regions without addressing their local toll. Our research shows agribusiness operations have repeatedly run roughshod over the rights of workers and rural communities.

Multiple pledges have been made over the years to address these problems. Yet, repeated failure to meet those goals has yielded a clear lesson: voluntary pledges are unenforceable and ineffectual. Agribusiness cannot be expected to do better unless it is made to, through regulation.

EU member states that are ADP signatories should publicly commit to be the gold standard for EUDR implementation, urging their other European partners to do the same.

— Defense lawyer involved in politically sensitive cases, September 2023

In August 2020, peaceful protests in Belarus began with hundreds of thousands of people gathering in the streets of Minsk and across Belarus following the contested electoral victory of Aliaksandr Lukashenka, who had already served as president for more than 26 years. Belarusian authorities responded with unprecedented brutality, using excessive force, arbitrarily detaining thousands of peaceful protesters, and subjecting them to ill-treatment and torture in detention before conveyor-belt administrative and criminal trials.

Since then, Belarusian authorities have unrolled widespread and systematic repression of any form of dissent. Government critics have been forced into exile or thrown behind bars on politically motivated charges. The number of political prisoners swelled and at time of publication exceeded 1300, according to Human Rights Center “Viasna,” the prominent Belarusian human rights organization. The term “political prisoner,” for the purpose of this report, includes anyone detained, imprisoned or otherwise deprived of their liberty by Belarusian authorities for peacefully exercising their rights and freedoms or defending human rights and fundamental freedoms.

February 2023 and March 2024 reports of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights found that some violations committed by Belarusian authorities in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election and in its aftermath “may amount to crimes against humanity” including the “crime of persecution.”

In the face of these grave and widespread rights violations, some lawyers stepped up to represent clients in politically motivated cases. In addition to fulfilling their obligations as defense lawyers to best represent and protect their clients, these lawyers also played a crucial role in shedding light on abuses in detention, including torture and lack of access to healthcare, exposing egregious violations of the right to fair trial, and serving as the only link between political prisoners and their families and supporters. To further isolate those prosecuted for peacefully exercising their rights and freedoms and stifle information about abuses, the authorities doubled down on their efforts to subjugate the legal profession and targeted those lawyers who refused to play by their increasingly draconian rules.

This report examines the Lukashenka government’s retribution against lawyers who represent government critics and its nearly complete takeover of the legal profession in Belarus. The authorities have subjected lawyers in politically motivated cases, as well as lawyers who criticize state abuses, to harassment, arbitrary revocation of their licenses, detention and administrative charges, and politically motivated criminal prosecution. Behind bars, lawyers along with other politically-targeted detainees and convicts, experience retaliatory ill-treatment. The authorities have left no space for earnest and efficient discharge of lawyers’ duties in politically motivated cases. At the time of writing, very few lawyers, if any, were willing to take on such cases, which has severely undermined the right to a fair trial, due process, and access to remedy in Belarus.

The report shows that while governmental crackdown on lawyers in times of political unrest in Belarus is not new, the scale and severity of this wave of repression is unprecedented. For the first time in the history of modern Belarus, lawyers have become political prisoners themselves for their work on behalf of clients.

At the time of writing, six lawyers—Maksim Znak, Aliaksandr Danilevich, Vital Brahinets, Anastasiya Lazarenka, Yuliya Yurhilevich, and Aliaksei Barodka—were serving sentences on politically motivated charges ranging from six to ten years. Such charges included providing legal aid to political opposition figures and activists or giving interviews to and sharing information with independent media labelled “extremist” by the authorities.

In addition to politically motivated prosecution, lawyers also have faced politically motivated disbarment. Since 2020, more than 140 lawyers have been disbarred by the regional bar associations or faced arbitrary license revocation by the Justice Ministry following decisions of its Qualification Commission because they supposedly breeched some regulations or were not sufficiently qualified to work as lawyers. These grounds are often easily exposed as flimsy pretexts: on average, those “unqualified” lawyers had more than 13.5 years of experience; many had successfully worked in the legal field for two to three decades, or more, and some of them were previously recognized by bar associations for their excellence.

State intimidation and persecution of lawyers in Belarus have a detrimental effect on the rights of their clients and are part of a larger set of measures taken by the authorities to undermine the right to legal counsel in politically motivated cases. Authorities often force lawyers in such cases to sign overly broad non-disclosure notices and have held trials on politically motivated charges behind closed doors without justification, preventing lawyers from disclosing information of public importance on the cases and hindering their ability to mount defenses by engaging experts and witnesses. Authorities have severely undermined the access of detainees and convicts to their lawyers, hindered lawyers’ access to and communication with clients, and routinely violated the confidentiality of lawyer-client communications.

The report also examines how the Belarusian government has established all-encompassing control over the legal profession in the country by controlling the admission of lawyers into the profession, regulating the way they discharge their duties, and exercising other broad controlling functions including but not limited to revoking lawyers’ licenses and essentially stripping lawyers’ self-governing bodies of independence.

In November 2021, a set of amendments into the Law on the Bar and Practice of Law in the Republic of Belarus (Law on the Bar) entered into force, which banned lawyers from working individually or opening law firms, requiring them to join legal consultation offices created and supervised by regional bar associations in coordination with the Justice Ministry. The amendments also significantly expanded the Justice Ministry’s control over the self-governing bodies of the bar and eased the conditions for obtaining a lawyer’s status for ex workers of law enforcement and judiciary.

In recent years, and in complete inversion of international norms on the independence of the legal profession, Belarusian authorities, including Aliaksandr Lukashenka himself, have repeatedly characterized the task of lawyers as that of “statesmen” carrying out duties assigned by the state, with an explicit obligation to protect the interests of the state. Authorities have sanctioned lawyers for criticizing the government, forced them to actively promote state ideology on historical and geopolitical issues, and publicly express support for the state, government officials, and administration policies.

The Belarusian Republican Bar Association (BRBA) and regional bar associations generally have failed to represent and protect the rights of their members and withheld support from lawyers facing obstacles in discharging their duties, which in recent years have come to include harassment, arbitrary detention, and criminal prosecution. Moreover, bar association executive bodies have become vehicles for the agenda of state officials, triggering sanctions against and disbarring lawyers deemed undesirable by the authorities. In light of the control exercised by the state over the formation of the Belarusian bar’s executive bodies and their work, these associations cannot be considered genuinely independent self-governing bodies representing the interests of all lawyers in Belarus.

Some lawyers described the current state of the Belarusian justice system and bar as a “total collapse of the legal system” and many felt “disarmed” in the face of systematic and widespread violations of due process, fair trial, and rule of law.

Yet, lawyers noted, that it is their duty to discharge their functions to the highest professional standard, notwithstanding the political motivation of their clients’ cases and the unprecedented pressure from the state:

“I swear to fulfill the duties of defense lawyer honestly and faithfully” - is the oath every lawyer takes before starting their professional journey. Taking this oath under current circumstances, when faithful and honest discharge of duties is impossible, is especially disheartening.

By systematically undermining lawyers’ guarantees in politically motivated cases and violating the rights of their clients, Belarusian authorities have made a mockery of the administration of justice in courts of law, depriving Belarusians of their right to fair trial and equal protection under the law. International standards underscore the importance of an independent legal profession to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.

The Belarusian government should immediately stop politically motivated prosecutions, end all harassment and attacks on lawyers, and ensure they can discharge their duties without interference or fear of reprisal. The Belarusian bar should end politically motivated retaliation against its members, protect the interests of lawyers and their clients, and uphold the independence of the legal profession. International actors should call on Belarusian authorities to adhere to their international obligations, stop using the judiciary as a repressive tool, release all political prisoners, and ensure that Belarusian lawyers face no obstacles in carrying out their professional duties in the best interests of their clients.

Methodology

This report was researched and drafted by Human Rights Watch in collaboration with Belarusian Association of Human Rights Lawyers and Right to Defence (defendersbelarus.org), an independent Belarusian project providing informational support to lawyers and human rights defenders.

Research for the report included Human Rights Watch remote or in-person interviews with 19 lawyers from several regions of Belarus. All lawyers interviewed provided verbal informed consent to participate and received no compensation. In many instances, the details of lawyers’ cases are withheld and their names are disguised with initials (which do not reflect real names) to protect their identities but are known to the authors of the report. Human Rights Watch also interviewed representatives of seven international and Belarusian human rights organizations working on protecting lawyers’ rights and documenting politically motivated repressions in Belarus.

Based on information available in the public domain and interviews with delicensed lawyers, the authors of the report analyzed 145 cases in which the Justice Ministry revoked lawyers’ licenses, following arbitrary attestation proceedings, unwarranted disciplinary proceedings, in many instances following their defense of clients against politically motivated prosecution or after they themselves spoke out on human rights issues.

The report also draws on analysis of other primary and secondary sources, including relevant legislation and by-laws; information publicly available on the websites of the Justice Ministry and other state bodies, as well as on websites of the Belarusian Republican Bar Association (BRBA) and regional bar associations; independent media reports; and reports and official statements carried on social media channels.

The report also draws on numerous publications by Right to Defence and on “The Crisis of the Belarusian Bar: How to Restore the Right to Defence,” a joint report by Right to Defence, Center for Constitutionalism and Human Rights, and Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights.

Human Right Watch wrote to the Belarusian Justice Ministry and the Belarusian Republican Bar Association in April 2024 seeking their response to a summary of the report findings. At the time of writing no response had been received.

I. Background

Aliaksandr Lukashenka has held the office of the President in Belarus since its establishment in 1994, he is now serving his sixth consecutive term. Throughout his rule, Lukashenka and his government have ruthlessly suppressed dissent in the country.

In 1997, Lukashenka issued a decree granting the Justice Ministry authority to license and regulate the work of lawyers in order to “increase the quality of the legal services.” This marked the beginning of the ministry’s three-decades-long journey towards total control over the legal profession in Belarus.

The key milestones in the governmental crackdown on lawyers and control of the legal profession took place in the context of broader politically motivated repression in response to public discontent.

Repression Following Peaceful Protests in 2010

In December 2010, around 30,000 people took to the streets of Minsk, the national capital, to protest Aliaksandr Lukashenka ’s contested victory in the presidential election. Belarusian authorities responded by brutally suppressing the protests, arresting hundreds, and charging dozens with “organizing or participating in riots,” including five former presidential candidates. Human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch, documented widespread denial of legal assistance to detainees, including denial of private meetings with or calls to a lawyer, both in administrative and criminal cases.

Between January and August 2011, the Justice Ministry revoked the licenses of at least nine lawyers in retaliation for representing clients in politically motivated cases following the December protests.

In January, the Justice Ministry initiated “inspections” of all lawyers and all legal consultation offices operated by the Minsk City Bar Association after its presidium (leadership body) had repeatedly refused to initiate disciplinary proceedings against specific lawyers identified by the ministry. The “inspections” were conducted jointly with the State Security Committee (KGB), which has no mandate for such engagement.

The Justice Ministry’s Qualification Commission, which amongst other tasks organizes and administers the professional legal entry exam, admissions process and re-certification of lawyers, used minor errors in paperwork and other bureaucratic pretexts to revoke the licenses of Aleh Aheyeu, Tatsiana Aheyeua, Uladzimir Tolstsik, and Tamara Harayeva for “grave violations of law incompatible with the title of a lawyer.” All of these lawyers were known for representing clients in politically motivated cases.

In July 2021, the UN Human Rights Committee found that by arbitrarily revoking the license of Aleh Aheyeu, who represented a defendant in a politically motivated case and spoke to the media about violations of the rights of his client, Belarusian authorities had violated Aheyeu’s freedom of speech and right to a fair trial.

In March 2011, following the submission of the Justice Ministry on alleged violations, the Minsk City Bar Association disbarred Pavel Sapelko, another prominent lawyer representing defendants in politically motivated cases.

In mid-June 2011, the Ministry of Justice initiated an “extraordinary re-certification” of all lawyers in Belarus to “increase [their] accountability and quality of professional duty performance.” Hanna Bakhtsina, Darya Lipkina, and Iryna Burak, all lawyers in politically motivated cases, did not “pass” the re-certification. Following an appeal to the ministry’s Qualification Commission, the decision in their cases was reversed. However, in August, the Qualification Commission did not certify Tamara Sidarenka, also a lawyer in a politically motivated case.

The Ministry of Justice also removed “undesirable” lawyers from the Qualification Commission, and the Minsk City Bar Association removed them from its presidium. The authorities also pushed through parliament a set of legislative amendments to increase the Justice Ministry’s control over the legal profession in Belarus.

Repression Following Peaceful Protests in 2017

In March 2017, a wave of large-scale peaceful protests took place against Presidential Decree No. 3, imposing an unemployment tax on citizens. The protests were brutally suppressed, and hundreds of peaceful protesters were arbitrarily detained.

Days before the planned protests, authorities arrested 35 people in the “Patriot” case, also known as the “White Legion” case, alleging that they had created an anti-government “unlawful armed unit.” Among those arrested were public officials and activists from the unregistered NGO “Malady Front” [Young Front] and members of the social-democratic party Narodnaya Gromada. In November 2017, the Investigative Committee closed the case, dropping all charges against the 35. However, in September 2017, eight of the 16 lawyers representing the defendants in the “White Legion” case were subjected to an extraordinary re-certification procedure at the Justice Ministry’s Qualification Commission. Lawyer Hanna Bakhtsina did not “pass” and consequently lost her license, and seven other lawyers were declared only “partially compliant with legal requirements.”

New Levels of Repression Following Peaceful Protests in 2020

On the night of August 9, 2020, following the highly contested victory of Aliaksandr Lukashenka in the presidential election, hundreds of thousands of peaceful protesters took to the streets of Minsk and other cities across Belarus. In the run-up to the election, authorities had jailed several opposition politicians aspiring to put their names on the ballot. The elections were neither free nor fair and there were credible reports of massive ballot rigging.

The protesters faced unprecedented levels of police brutality on the streets, mass arbitrary detentions, as well as torture and ill-treatment behind bars. In the next few months, Belarusians continued protesting peacefully despite this intense repression.

In the three and a half years following the announcement of the election results, tens of thousands of people, including opposition figures and their supporters, independent journalists, human rights defenders, artists and writers, trade unionists, activists, and peaceful protestors, were arrested or imprisoned on politically motivated charges. Behind bars, those detained, prosecuted and convicted in politically linked cases faced ill-treatment often amounting to torture, and prolonged isolation and incommunicado detention, some detentions constituting enforced disappearances.

Those charged with offenses have faced systematic violations of the rights to due process and a fair trial. Judges not only failed to protect the rule of law and uphold fundamental rights in their courtrooms and the processes they oversaw, but themselves facilitated violations, due to their lack of independence and tight control enjoyed by the government. Regrettably, judges in Belarus have too often become an instrument of repression rather than a tool for holding authorities accountable for violations.





II. Undermining the Right to Legal Counsel

The Critical Role of Lawyers in Politically Motivated Cases

All the lawyers interviewed for this report, as well as colleagues and family members of political prisoners interviewed by Human Rights Watch and other rights groups, attested to the vital role of lawyers in politically motivated cases in Belarus. The right to independent legal counsel lays the foundation for the right to a fair trial, access to a remedy, justice, and rule of law.

In Belarus, political prisoners face violations of their rights and freedoms during preliminary investigations, in court, and following the verdict and transfer to penitentiary institutions. Such violations include the restriction of communications and denial of access to lawyers, ill-treatment, isolation cells, and, in the worst cases incommunicado detention and torture. Placement of political prisoners into even harsher conditions than the general prison population is the norm. One of the lawyers interviewed by Human Rights Watch said:

The participation of a lawyer is important to anyone, but in a situation where authorities can severely limit all your rights purely for political motive, it is even more valuable.

Since 2020, thousands of individuals have become political prisoners in Belarus. According to Justice Ministry statistics, the overall number of lawyers in the country decreased from 2,200 in January 2020 to 1,602 in January 2024, leaving roughly one lawyer per 5,700 residents. Between the generally low number of lawyers in Belarus, the qualifications required in politically motivated cases, and the risks involved, only a limited number of lawyers step up to represent clients in such cases. Due to continuous repression and the intimidation of lawyers representing political prisoners, finding a lawyer ready to take on a politically motivated case and provide effective legal counsel has become extremely difficult, if not impossible.

In a situation in which there is no prospect of a fair trial, lawyers say that presenting a defendant’s position on the case, even with no hope for acquittal, is crucial to the dignity of their clients and essential if there is to be any hope of safeguarding their fundamental rights. In addition to representing and defending clients in court, lawyers representing political prisoners file complaints about violations of their clients’ rights and bring the violations to public attention when competent authorities refuse to address them. These include violations of the rights of political prisoners already serving their sentences in penitentiary institutions and suffering ill-treatment and other abuses.

When authorities restrict the communications of political prisoners with the outside world, lawyers become the only channel through which they can share and receive information.

A trusted defense lawyer provides critical support for clients in politically motivated cases who are often isolated and nearly always under pressure from authorities. As one lawyer told us:

For [my client, who is a political prisoner], I was a huge source of support. She knew I was fighting for her. My presence helped when she talked [during the trial] about being tortured [in detention]. It is always very important … for people to know that there is someone 100 percent on their side. And that this person will do everything to show that what is happening to them is unlawful and unfair.

Several lawyers emphasized the distressing effect that their abrupt exit from cases following their politically motivated disbarment had on their clients. In addition to the detrimental effect it has on the defense, it violates the right of a defendant to have a lawyer of their choosing. One lawyer told Human Rights Watch that he had to take over a case following the disbarment of his colleague and signed the contract with the family member of a political prisoner. When the lawyer came to the colony to see his new client, the client was deeply distressed, and it took a while to convince the client that the lawyer was in fact sent by the family and could be trusted.

Since February 2023, Belarusian authorities have subjected at least six high profile political prisoners to arbitrary isolation in punishment cells and denied them any communication with the outside world, including with their lawyers, for more than a year. Such prolonged detention facilitates the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment, as well as constitutes such treatment on its own, and carries risk of enforced disappearance.

Interference with Legal Representation

Non-Disclosure Notices and Closed Trials

Under Belarusian law, the state investigator in charge of a case is entitled to request that defendants, their lawyer and other participants in pre-trial proceedings sign non-disclosure clauses. Disseminating information about a pre-trial investigation after signing a non-disclosure notice constitutes a crime, unless authorized by the investigator.

After 2020, investigators increasingly forced lawyers in politically motivated criminal cases to sign overly broad non-disclosure notices.

One lawyer told Human Rights Watch that public scrutiny is especially important in politically motivated cases when human rights violations are committed against detainees by the authorities. Another lawyer said that overly broad and arbitrary non-disclosure notices became widespread starting in 2020, and seemed purposefully designed to silence lawyers in politically motivated cases:

Before 2020, non-disclosure notices were only used in certain categories of criminal cases. But the need to communicate with mass media arose specifically after the intensification of [politically motivated] repression and the authorities acted to stifle such communications.

In most cases we examined, investigators did not explain the grounds for issuing a non-disclosure notice and often did not specify which information was subject to the notice. A lawyer recalled:

When asked to explain, what [information] specifically fell under the non-disclosure notice, investigators replied “decide for yourselves.”

Belarusian authorities arbitrarily have used “breach of non-disclosure notice” as a pretext for the prosecution of lawyers in politically motivated cases and the revocation of their licenses.

As a result, lawyers are forced to self-censor their public communications and refrain from disclosing any information about the case to third parties, including the client’s family members and any external experts they want to engage in the defense. One lawyer said:

Say, I want an expert to testify or provide written analysis. Due to the non-disclosure notice, I cannot show them the findings of the previous experts or share the details of the case.

Meanwhile, law enforcement officials are at liberty to make false public statements claiming to have established the guilt of defendants in politically motivated cases, which undermine the protections of the rules on presumption of innocence and equality of arms that should exist in the adversarial system.

The practice of closed trials in politically motivated cases has also become widespread over the past three years.

In line with the fair trial rights, Belarusian criminal law stipulates that “transparency” is one of the core principles of court proceedings. A judge can, however, close a trial to the public to prevent the dissemination of protected information such as state secrets, information about a trial participant’s private life, or information that could be degrading to them. Court hearings can also be closed to the public in the interests of the safety of trial participants and those close to them, as well as in cases where defendants are younger than 16. Lawyers can be held criminally liable for dissemination of information about closed trials.

In politically motivated cases, judges increasingly have closed trials to the public in absence of any legal grounds, violating the defendants’ right to a fair trial. Lawyers told us that the severe restrictions on dissemination of information entailed by closed trials undermine their ability to build a defense. When engaging external independent experts during closed trials, for example, lawyers cannot share relevant case files or explain important details of the case to them.

Lawyers interviewed for this report said that once a hearing is closed, fair trial standards are more likely to be violated and judges are more inclined to dismiss motions made by the defense. Maryia Kolesava-Hudzilina, lawyer who represented clients in politically motivated cases, said:

When the courtroom’s doors get shut, human rights violations are most likely committed behind those doors. [The court] does not give proper consideration to the defense’s plea to disqualify the judge, … or any [other] motions, and does not call on our witnesses.

Human rights lawyer Siarhei Zikratski, who represented independent journalists in politically motivated cases, said:

A judge in an open versus a closed hearing are two different people. The judge feels much freer [to violate fair trial principles] without public scrutiny.

Mikhail Kiryliuk, a lawyer who represented political prisoners, told Human Rights Watch that when he asked the KGB investigator what kind of evidence he intended to present, the investigator responded, “we do not need any proof, the hearing will be closed.”

In closed trials, the prosecution often classifies evidence, including information regarding the grounds for indictment and the identity of witnesses. Lawyer Tatsiana Lishankova, who has represented numerous rights defenders and other political prisoners, said:

A closed trial complicates the defense. For example, in these types of cases the [prosecution’s] experts can be made classified. You aren’t able to verify their credentials, they are not called to testify, ostensibly to ensure their security, even though the trial is closed. You cannot inquire about their methodology or ask questions. Also, for people [on trial], it's very important to know that someone came to support them in the court room.

Human rights organizations have found that restrictions on information sharing imposed by non-disclosure notices and closed trials also hinder the ability of victims to seek remedy for human rights violations and make individual complaints at the international level, such as to the UN Human Rights Committee, which oversees compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). This is because sharing documents related to the proceedings at the national level can lead to the lawyers’ prosecution for breaching non-disclosure notice. One lawyer said:

Following a closed trial, you cannot disclose the substance of the verdict even to [the client’s] relatives. How is one supposed to file a complaint with the [UN] Human Rights Committee? You cannot even attach the verdict.

Additionally, due to the state policy of labelling independent media and human rights groups as “extremist” and “terrorist,” lawyers increasingly fear sharing information, fearing prosecution for aiding terrorist or extremist activities.

Lawyers also said they were not allowed to make copies, including by taking photos, of the prosecution’s voluminous case files, which undermines their ability to prepare a defense.





Undermining “Equality of Arms”

Lawyers interviewed for this report noted that in politically motivated trials, their treatment by courts is distinctly different and inferior to the treatment of prosecutors. As one of them pointed out, the treatment leaves defense lawyers feeling “disarmed.” Judges in such cases have become increasingly unresponsive to lawyers’ pleas to access the full case materials of the preliminary investigation or the testimonies of “classified” witnesses or independent experts. Additionally, lawyers struggle to mount an effective defense, as the specifics of the alleged crimes for which their clients are charged are often too vague: for example, a client is charged with “aiding extremism” but the authorities do not spell out which particular episode, activities, or publications the charge stemmed from.

The equality of parties before the court is a crucial element of the right to a fair trial. Adversarial elements of the proceedings and the ability to mount an effective line of defense cannot be relegated to a formality in the court of law.

Access to Clients and Confidentiality

The Belarusian authorities have introduced several policies that limit the accessibility of individuals facing politically motivated charges under either criminal or administrative law, as well as the confidentiality of their communications. These policies directly erode defendants’ right to unhindered access to legal counsel and severely undermine lawyers’ ability to discharge their professional duties in line with fair trial standards.

Following the unprecedented spike in politically motivated administrative charges after the 2020 mass protests, detention facilities routinely have denied lawyers access to their clients before, during, and after trial. Authorities also arbitrarily have cited measures introduced in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, lack of available meeting rooms and other pretexts to deny access, while state investigators and police officers still have unhindered access to detainees.

Court hearings on politically motivated administrative charges typically take place via Skype with the lawyers physically present in the courtroom and their clients connecting from a detention center.

When the lawyer is not next to you, defense tools cannot be fully utilized and it’s a big stress for the client. From my own experience, when your lawyer is not [physically] next to you, you don’t feel that you have a defender who is 100 per cent on your side.”

In those instances when lawyers were allowed to speak with their clients via Skype before a court hearing, they were not given enough time. For instance, one lawyer was given three minutes to consult with the client. Lawyers stress that these conversations were not confidential, as the court clerk remained in the room with the lawyer and the detention facility convoy guard was next to the client. Sometimes, other individuals awaiting trial were also present in the same room with the client.

Belarusian law enforcement authorities increasingly have begun to open criminal cases against individuals initially placed under administrative arrest and used that time to question them in detention facilities without a lawyer, and put pressure on them.

In politically motivated criminal cases, authorities increasingly have demanded that lawyers obtain the state investigator’s permission to visit their clients in jail. When asked about the legal grounds for obtaining such permission, officials at detention facilities have told lawyers these are “internal regulations.”

Lawyers also have experienced denial or severe restriction of access to their jailed clients, including in the pre-trial detention facility (SIZO) of the KGB in Minsk; SIZO N1 on Valadarskaha street in Minsk; the prison (also used as a SIZO) in Žodzina, a town near Minsk; and a SIZO in the city of Homieĺ.

Lawyers said that detention facility authorities have artificially created long queues for lawyers visiting clients by restricting the number of rooms available for meetings and limiting visitation hours.

They also flagged that as of the autumn of 2020, authorities began introducing special rooms at pre-trial detention facilities for lawyer to meet with clients in political cases. These rooms are set up in ways that directly violate lawyer-client confidentiality.

Human rights lawyer Liudmila Kazak described the experience of meeting with her client, Maria Kalesnikava, a prominent opposition figure prosecuted on politically motivated grounds, in SIZO N1 on Valadarskaha street in Minsk:

There were two rooms [for meetings with certain clients in high profile politically motivated cases] with thick plexiglass partitions with small holes to allow for breathing. To somehow converse with the client, I had to raise my voice, of course. Naturally, this was done so that conversations between lawyers and their clients could be easily overheard. Often, we could hear someone moving behind the wall, apparently, listening [to us]. These “extremely dangerous criminals” like Kalesnikava were also accompanied by a special convoy. And convoy officers stood right behind the door with an open window above it. The arrangement of these rooms did not allow for confidentiality.

According to Kazak, who had also worked with two clients on death row, the two rooms in SIZO N1 previously had been designated for lawyers’ meetings with clients sentenced to capital punishment. The rooms were then equipped with a mesh wire netting separating the lawyer from the client as a security measure with a slot for passing documents from lawyer to client. Around October 2020, however, these rooms were repurposed for lawyers’ meetings with high profile political prisoners, and that was when the plexiglass with no slot for documents was installed.

By January 2021, similar remodeling of meeting rooms had taken place in Prison N8 in Žodzina, where many political prisoners were held in pre-trial detention. In early 2022, the SIZO in the city of Homieĺ was also equipped with a meeting room split by two glass partitions and bars, which forced lawyers and their clients to have to yell to each other during meetings to be heard.

Many lawyers who work on politically motivated criminal cases also shared concerns about audio and video recording of their meetings with clients in pre-trial detention facilities.

Lawyer Kiryliuk, who represented a client in a politically motivated case, said that during a confidential meeting with the client in a pre-trial detention facility, law enforcement officers ordered him to put his mask back on, and the officers were not hiding the fact that they could see and hear the conversation.

In April 2021, state TV channel ONT broadcasted a video of jailed opposition politician Siarhei Tsikhanouski with his lawyer Natallia Matskevich filmed at SIZO N1 in Minsk during their supposedly confidential meeting. Their conversation was audible on the video.

One lawyer said:

Before 2020, we could only guess [that conversations with the clients were listened to and recorded], but we could not even think they would admit to it so openly on TV. There is a CCTV camera in the SIZO KGB room [for meetings with lawyers]. But if you ask about it, they respond, “We can see you but cannot hear you, where did you get this idea from? The sound recording is turned off.”

Another practice that became common in politically motivated criminal cases after 2020 is requiring lawyers to pass documents to their clients via pre-trial detention facility authorities. Lawyers said that authorities not only violate confidentiality by reading the documents, but also censor them.

Several lawyers who faced arbitrary detention said that when they were subjected to searches and detention by law enforcement, officers seized documents related to their clients’ cases and looked through their phones and other devices, in violation of both confidentiality and the right to privacy.

Lawyers also reported violations of confidentiality of their conversations with clients in penal colonies. Lawyers who represented prominent political prisoners said that conversations with convicted clients took place in no-contact visitation rooms that were divided by a partition, with the client sitting on one side and the lawyer on the other side. Conversations took place over the phone while penal colony staff members were present and listened in via a separate phone which can connect to any conversation in the room. One lawyer said that a staff member was also taking notes. Human rights lawyer Lishankova recollected:

It was obvious they were listening [to us] in penal colony. Only the two of us were in the visiting room with the [partition, talking via] phone, and a colony staff member was sitting there, also with the phone [that can connect to any conversation in the room], shamelessly listening to us.

One lawyer noted that penal colony authorities allow lawyers to meet with their clients only in such rooms, even though other rooms with better conditions for maintaining confidentiality often are available.

Access to Legal Services Following Verdicts

UN experts and Belarusian rights groups have documented the widespread and systematic discriminatory placement of political prisoners in Belarus into harsher conditions than faced by other prisoners. Authorities subject them to prolonged incommunicado detention, denial of adequate and timely medical care, other forms of ill-treatment, and denial of communication with the outside world, including family.

In this context, lawyers noted, access to their clients after a verdict is important not only to preserve their clients’ right to legal assistance but also to safeguard other rights such as freedom from torture and other forms of ill-treatment, the right to life, the right to information, and the right to privacy.

Some lawyers representing political prisoners said that while penitentiary institutions were mired in lawlessness, the likelihood of ill-treatment was less if a political prisoner had an active lawyer.

One of the lawyers noted that assisting clients with writing complaints about rights violations serves as a check on prison authorities and discourages prison staff from “putting pressure on political prisoners… all these things they can do so easily if the prisoner is all alone without assistance.”

Lawyers have found access to their clients in politically motivated cases even more challenging following their transfer to penitentiary institutions after verdicts and sentencing.

Article 62 of the Belarusian Constitution grants everyone the right to legal assistance at any time for the realization and protection of their rights and freedoms. It also prohibits hindering the provision of legal aid.

Since around February 2023, authorities arbitrarily have subjected high profile political prisoners, such as members of the political opposition, including Maria Kalesnikava, Viktar Babaryka, Siarhei Tsikhanouski, and Mikalai Statkevich, to incommunicado detention in penitentiary institutions, which, among other things, has prevented them from accessing their lawyers. According to Belarusian rights groups, other political prisoners are often denied meetings with their lawyers.

According to the Belarusian Penal Executive Code, convicted prisoners have a right to meet with their lawyers but need to file relevant meeting requests. Lawyers said that penitentiary authorities increasingly pretend that no meeting request has been filed or, contrary to past practice (see below), insist on written requests in ways that stymie access to counsel.

One lawyer explained:

In the past, a few years back, if a lawyer came [to a penitentiary institution] and there was no request filed, the authorities could ask the inmate whether they wanted to have a meeting. If so, [the client] would put a request in writing and have a meeting with lawyer [straight away]. I believe that now all those [political prisoners] we have no contact with certainly know they need to write the requests; they know they need to file them in advance. In this situation it is unclear what’s the reasoning behind denying lawyers meetings with clients under the pretext of no request filed. Possibly, the requests either get buried or the prisoners are in no position to write and file them. Today, the most notable figures [political prisoners] are incommunicado.

Another lawyer said:

Since February 2023, [prison management] does not let lawyers in to see some political prisoners under the pretext that there was no [written] request filed by the client. Penal authorities interpret legal norms in their own way. They insist that the request should be in written form, and that it should be filed for each meeting separately.

One lawyer noted inmates in punishment cells are denied pen and paper, making it all but impossible for isolated inmates to make written request while in isolation, a violation of the right to legal assistance.

International standards require that all prisoners have access to effective legal aid. Prisoners should, in particular, have access to legal aid for filing requests related to their treatment and the conditions of their imprisonment.

Belarusian law does not provide for mandatory legal representation following a conviction, which means that in order to receive legal aid, a convict must have a preexisting contract with a lawyer or sign one via their lawful representatives, such as family members. In cases where lawyers are abruptly disbarred on political grounds, their clients are left with no access to legal aid for a protracted time period while their family or supporters looks for a new lawyer willing to take on a politically motivated case which is extremely difficult in a situation when very few lawyers are willing to take on such cases.

Lawyers say that when visiting clients in penal colonies, they often are asked by authorities to show all the documents they have with them, are prohibited from bringing in documents, and in some cases face body searches.



III. Persecution of Lawyers as a Form of Reprisal

Arbitrary Detention and Administrative Prosecution

According to our research, law enforcement authorities have subjected at least 23 lawyers to arbitrary administrative arrests since autumn 2020 after they represented clients in politically motivated cases or publicly spoke out on rights abuses or other issues deemed sensitive by the government. The charges included “disobeying police,” “disseminating extremist materials,” “petty hooliganism,” and “violating the regulations on public gatherings.” Authorities also subjected some lawyers to arbitrary detention and interrogation and then released them without charges.

Lawyers interviewed for this report said that authorities increasingly have employed politically motivated administrative charges against them and their colleagues as a tactic to quickly suspend them from representing their clients in politically motivated cases or in reprisal for their work or public stand on human rights issues.

On March 20, 2023, officers from the Interior Ministry’s Main Directorate for Combating Organized Crime and Corruption (GUBOPiK) arbitrarily detained six lawyers representing clients in high-profile politically motivated cases. The GUBOPiK officers questioned the lawyers, searched their homes and offices, and seized their electronic devices. Three lawyers, namely, Darya Lipkina, Uladzimir Statskevich, and Ivan Chyzhyk, were then released. Two others, Yury Kozikau and Artsiom Semianau were sentenced to one and two consecutive 15-day administrative arrests, respectively. The sixth lawyer, Inesa Alenskaya, was given an administrative fine after three days in detention awaiting the court hearing. All six lawyers then lost their licenses or left the bar.

On February 28, 2024, KGB officers carried out a raid against lawyers, detaining at least 12. At the time of writing, the details of the detentions were unknown. Halina Parkhimchyk, one of the lawyers, spent a week in pre-trial detention for alleged participation in the 2020 protests and providing financial aid to victims of repressions via Facebook donations. She was then released on her own recognizance as a suspect in the case and fled the country. Other lawyers arrested in February 2024 were also released.

In 22 cases of administrative prosecution between September 2020 and March 2023, lawyers were stripped of licenses following decisions of bar associations or the Justice Ministry specifically citing their administrative prosecution as grounds. In some cases, law enforcement officers seized lawyer ID cards from the detainees, preventing those lawyers from carrying out their duties immediately after release.

Lawyers also said that arbitrary detention and administrative prosecution have served as a means of intimidation, sending a chilling signal to anyone defending political prisoners.

[This was done] so that other lawyers would hesitate to defend the interests of political prisoners in Belarus because they could face the same things we did – detention and disbarment.

Out of 19 lawyers interviewed for this report, seven had experienced arbitrary detention and five of those seven served short-term administrative arrest sentences.

In some cases, during detention and interrogation, lawyers have experienced beatings, other ill-treatment and torture, including threat of sexual assault, by a variety of law enforcement officials, including riot police, KGB officers, and officers at local police precincts.

On September 24, 2020, in the middle of the day, three plainclothes law enforcement officers in Minsk grabbed human rights lawyer Liudmila Kazak under her arms and dragged her towards a car. Kazak has almost 20 years of experience as a lawyer and represented clients in high-level politically motivated cases and capital punishment cases.

Since this did not look like a [formal] detention to me and […] no one told me “You are being detained” and why, I started screaming “Help! I am being kidnapped!” They took me to the Central district police department [of Minsk]. I complained about my health, asked for an ambulance but they would not call it. The head of the police department did not only know what was going on [with me] and did not interfere, he did not accept my written complaint and ordered to get me out of his cabinet.

Kazak’s family and lawyer were only informed about her detention late that evening, around eight hours after the fact, and the lawyer was only allowed to see her next morning, at around 11.

Kazak was fined for “disobeying a lawful order of request of an official” and subsequently had her license revoked.

On the evening of November 29, 2022, in Minsk, plainclothes GUBOPiK officers forced human rights lawyer Lishankova out of a taxi and into their vehicle and took her to the GUBOPiK headquarters. Lishankova had practiced law for 10 years and represented several clients in politically motivated cases. Following her arbitrary detention, a court in Minsk sentenced Lishankova to short term arrest on bogus charges of “petty hooliganism” and Minsk City Bar Association subsequently disbarred her citing “commitment of misdemeanors incompatible with the title of a lawyer.”

Lishankova was then sentenced to administrative arrest for “petty hooliganism” and subsequently had her license revoked.

Another lawyer, who asked to withhold his name for security reasons, also spoke about the ill-treatment he experienced in the hands of the law enforcement: “They used brutal force against me [to get my phone’s password]. Naturally, I could not be sure how this was going to end for me. But I realized at that moment I was not tough enough to experiment, so I gave in.”

One lawyer said the law enforcement beat them and threatened with taser, forcing them to share passwords to access their devices.

Lawyers said that law enforcement officers, sometimes forcefully, accessed their phones following detention and extracted data from their social media chats. Authorities also seized their documents and devices – those they had on their person at the time of detention and those from their homes during searches. In addition to personal information, authorities seized documents and other data containing client-lawyer privileged communications, materials from closed trials, and data protected by non-disclosure agreements.

In Belarus, penitentiary authorities intentionally create worse detention conditions for detainees charged with administrative misdemeanors in politically motivated cases and separate them in “political” cells. Three lawyers who served their administrative arrest also reported being confined in cells intended for political prisoners in detention centers.

In “political” cells, the inmates typically are refused mattresses and bedding, and are forced to sleep on a bare metal bed frame. The cells have bright lights on all night and the guards repeatedly wake the inmates up for roll calls. They are not allowed food parcels, denied books, and pens and paper, which prevents them from writing complaints about detention conditions. Lawyers say the cells are cold but detainees are not allowed warm clothing, shoes, or hats. “Political” cells are often severely overcrowded and have worse sanitary conditions than regular cells.

One lawyer who served a short-term arrest sentence provided the following description of the detention conditions:

Your “regular” inmate is allowed to bring outerwear into cells—jackets, hats—so, if a person walks into [a cell] without any warm clothing it’s immediately clear they’re “political.” Before the trial took place, I was in a standard “political” cell. No mattress. We had all of it there: lights on [round the clock], wake-up calls twice a night for checks, water constantly running from the tap, absence of writing supplies, books, and what not.

Human rights lawyer Lishankova spent several hours of her short-term arrest sentence in a “political” cell and was then transferred to a regular cell. The next day, she overheard a detention center staff member saying that she was “doing too well” implying they should make detention conditions even worse for her.

Two lawyers we spoke with served part of their administrative arrest sentence in regular “non-political” cells. They both attested to the better detention conditions there, such as being allowed to sleep through the night and with dimed lights, having mattresses and some bed linen, as well as books, pens, paper, etc. They also said the “regular” cells were less overcrowded than the “political” ones to which they were eventually transferred.

Criminal Prosecution

At time of writing, at least six lawyers were behind bars on politically motivated charges ranging from “aiding extremist activity” and “calling for sanctions” to “conspiring to seize power” in reprisal for providing legal aid to political opposition and activists or giving interviews to and sharing information with independent media labelled “extremist” by the authorities. At least six other lawyers have faced politically motivated criminal prosecution since 2020 and were sentenced to a fine, served their sentence in part or fully, or fled the country.

Authorities have subjected the lawyers in confinement to ill-treatment reserved for political prisoners, such as restricting their rights to receive and send correspondence or to meet with their family members and lawyers; putting them on a list of “persons involved in terrorism” which restricts their financial transactions and leads to heightened supervision by penitentiary staff; arbitrary isolating them in punishment cells; and keeping them in prolonged incommunicado detention, which amounts to torture and may constitute enforced disappearance.

According to international standards, “lawyers shall not be identified with their clients or their clients' causes as a result of discharging their functions” and shall not suffer sanctions for any action taken in accordance with recognized professional duties, standards, and ethics. International human rights law forbids discrimination on political grounds.

Maksim Znak

Maksim Znak is a former lawyer of the Minsk Regional Bar Association and a former professor of law at the Belarusian State University.

In May 2020, Znak joined Babaryka’s team to provide legal assistance to the aspiring contender for the 2020 presidential elections. In June 2020, law enforcement officers arbitrarily detained Babaryka and his son Eduard, who also worked for the campaign, when they were on their way to submit Babaryka's supporters’ signatures to the Central Election Commission.

Ten days later, Znak filed a petition on behalf of Babaryka for the official registration of his candidacy and represented his interests during the registration procedure, including by appealing the refusal by authorities to register Babaryka’s candidacy with the Supreme Court of Belarus.

In July 2021, Babaryka was sentenced to 14 years in prison for “laundering money obtained via criminal acts” and “receiving bribes.” In July 2023, his son was sentenced to eight years in prison for “organizing or preparing activities gravely violating public order,” “tax evasion,” and “inciting hatred.”

On August 10, 2020, the day after the official announcement of the victory of Aliaksandr Lukashenka in the presidential elections, Znak contested the election results while representing Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, a presidential candidate in the elections and wife of jailed presidential contender Tsikhanouski. Later that month, Znak filed an appeal on behalf of Tsikhanouskaya to deem the elections invalid. Znak also joined the presidium of the Opposition Coordination Council, established to facilitate democratic transfer of power in Belarus.

In September 2020, officers of the Investigative Committee, the country’s chief investigation agency, arrested Znak at Babaryka’s election headquarters on charges of “calls for actions aimed at harming the national interests of Belarus.” In February 2021, Znak was also charged with “conspiracy to seize power by unconstitutional means” and “creating and leading an extremist formation.” In August 2021, the court began the closed trial of Znak and Kalesnikava, another prominent opposition figure and Znak’s client. In September 2021, the Minsk Regional Court sentenced Znak and Kalesnikava to 10 and 11 years in prison, respectively.

In December 2021, the council of the Minsk Regional Bar Association disbarred Znak due to the court verdict, alleging that Znak was guilty of a premeditated crime.

In May 2022, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention issued an opinion finding that Znak’s detention was arbitrary as his detention was based on his peaceful exercise of rights protected by international law, and on discrimination resulting from his political opinion and his status as a lawyer for a political opposition party. The working group also concluded that the trial against Znak should have not taken place and his right to a fair trial was violated.

In May 2022, the KGB put Znak on its list of individuals involved in terrorist activities, restricting all his financial transactions.

Authorities at penal colony N3, where Znak is serving his sentence, repeatedly have subjected him to isolation in punishment cells and denied him any contact with the outside world since February 2023, when his family last received a letter from him. Such prolonged incommunicado detention amounts to torture and carries the risk of enforced disappearance.

In March 2023, Tsikhanouskaya, Znak’s most high-profile former client who has already long lived in exile, was sentenced to 15 years in absentia under seven articles of the Criminal Code, ranging from “conspiracy to seize power” to “high treason.”

In January 2024, the UN Human Rights Committee registered Znak's individual communication against Belarus and then called on Belarus for urgent interim measures, including access to qualified medical assistance and the ability to communicate with his lawyers and family while his case is under review.

Aliaksandr Danilevich

In May 2022, KGB officers detained lawyer Aliaksandr Danilevich in his office. A renowned specialist in sports law, Danilevich also provided assistance to those detained on administrative charges in connection with the 2020 peaceful protests and signed a petition against Russia’s war in Ukraine in February 2022.

In January 2023, the Investigative Committee published a statement saying the investigation against Danilevich was completed and indicting him on charges of “aiding extremist activity” and “aiding the calls for restrictive measures (sanctions) via mass media or online.”

According to the statement, Danilevich “actively advised and aided the processes of forming public calls by extremists to incite harm to the national security of Belarus” by strike committee representatives. One of the cited examples of his “criminal activities” was the drafting of letters and documents addressed to a Norwegian company, Yara, a reliable large buyer of potash fertilizers from Belaruskali, one of the largest state-owned companies in Belarus. “In his ‘letters’ he relayed false information about the political, social, and economic situation in Belarus,” the statement said.

Click to expand Image © 2024 Yuliya Pesenka-Hramatneva

Authorities accused Danilevich of providing “advice, guidance, information and other assistance” to his clients, former Olympic swimmer Aliaksandra Herasimenia and political activist Aliaksandr Apeykin, by having drafted six letters addressed to Yara, the International Olympic Committee, and the International Ski and Snowboard Federation. In December 2022, Herasimenia and Apeykin, who had both fled Belarus, were sentenced in absentia to 12 years of imprisonment over “publicly calling for sanctions against Belarus, individuals, and legal entities of the republic.”

In addition to those accusations, authorities also charged Danilevich with giving an interview to the leading Belarusian sports media, Tribuna.com, which the authorities had deemed “extremist” in 2021. In the interview about the risks that lawyers working on politically motivated cases face in Belarus, Danilevich spoke about the threat of losing his license over signing a petition against the war in Ukraine and about the police brutality against peaceful protesters in the summer of 2020.

During the trial, Danilevich pleaded not guilty, stressing that the “actions committed by him as a part of his professional duties as a lawyer did not amount to national security threat.” He also stressed that he neither drafted nor edited the letters, but only provided legal advice to his clients after reading the documents.

In April 2023, the Minsk City Court sentenced Danilevich to 10 years in a penal colony with a heightened security regime. In July 2023, the court of appeals reduced Danilevich’s sentence to six years in prison. At time of writing, he was serving his sentence in Penal Colony N17 in Škłoŭ.

Vital Brahinets

In May 2022, KGB officers detained lawyer Vital Brahinets who represented clients in politically motivated cases, including leading Belarusian human rights defender Ales Bialiatski, co-recipient of the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize, and another prosecuted lawyer, Andrei Machalau. Brahinets was taken into custody several days before the opening of Machalau’s trial.

Authorities claimed that after he was brought from home to a police station for a “check for involvement in protest activities,” Brahinets started screaming and tried to escape. He was sentenced to 15 days of arrest for “disobeying the lawful police order.” After serving his administrative sentence, he was immediately sentenced to another 15 days on unknown charges.

In June 2022, Brahinets faced criminal charges and was transferred from administrative detention facility to a pretrial detention center.

Click to expand Image © 2024 Yuliya Pesenka-Hramatneva

In early January 2023, Human Rights Center “Viasna” reported that Brahinets had been charged with “inciting social hatred and enmity,” “calling for restrictive measures (sanctions),” “creation of extremist formation or participation in such,” and “active participation in actions, gravely violating public order.”

On February 2, 2023, the Minsk City Court sentenced Brahinets to 8 years in a penal colony with heightened security regime following a closed-door trial.

In August 2022, the Qualification Commission of the Justice Ministry revoked Brahinets’s license, following his disbarment by the Minsk Regional Bar Association due to a supposed “misdemeanor, incompatible with the title of a lawyer.” At time of writing, he was serving his sentence in Penal Colony N17 in Škłoŭ.

In December 2023, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention issued an opinion finding that the arrests and subsequent detention of Brahinets were arbitrary, including by virtue of the gravity of the violation of his right to a fair trial, and based on his political opinion and his status as a lawyer for the opposition. The working group called on Belarusian authorities to release Brahinets immediately and accord him an enforceable right to compensation and other reparations.

In August 2022, law enforcement detained lawyer Uladzimir Anhelski, who, at the time, represented Brahinets. Anhelski was sentenced to 14 days of arrest for “disobeying a police order.” In November 2022, the ministry revoked Anhelski’s license after he was disbarred following his arrest.

Anastasiya Lazarenka

In June 2022, a group of armed GUBOPiK officers in full protective gear stormed the home of lawyer Anastasiya Lazarenka in Minsk, breaking the windows and the entrance door. Lazarenka provided legal aid to several individuals prosecuted on politically motivated grounds following the state crackdown on peaceful protesters in 2020.

A video published on GUBOPiK’s Telegram channel on June 3, 2020, shows the storming of Lazarenka’s house and then cuts to Lazarenka speaking directly to camera, apparently under duress, who says she was detained on suspicion of committing “incitement of hatred or enmity” under article 130 of the Criminal Code for allegedly having leaked the personal data of police officers.

Click to expand Image © 2024 Yuliya Pesenka-Hramatneva

In March 2023, rights groups reported that Lazarenka was also charged under article 203-1 for “illegal acts in relation to the information about private life” and part 1 of article 342 for “organizing and preparing actions gravely violating public order.”

The state prosecution stated that Lazarenka had reached out and shared personal data of two police officers with the creators of the “Black Book of Belarus” Telegram channel, which published the personal details of law enforcement officers, judges, and state officials allegedly involved in rights violations during and after the August 2020 protests. They claimed that she had obtained that personal data while acting in her capacity as a defense lawyer. They also charged Lazarenka with participation in a peaceful protest in August 2020 when she was providing legal aid to protesters released from Akrestina detention center in Minsk, notorious for its ill-treatment of detainees. Lazarenka pleaded not guilty.

In May 2023, the Minsk City Court sentenced Lazarenka to six years in a penal colony. Shortly before her trial, one of Lazarenka’s lawyers was designated as a witness by the prosecution, which prevented him from representing her interests in the case, another tactic used by Belarusian authorities to hinder the defense in politically motivated trials.

In November 2023, the KGB also put Lazarenka on its list of “persons involved with terrorist activities,” which leads to prohibition of money transfers and heightened supervision by penitentiary institution authorities.

Yuliya Yurhilevich

Yulia Yurhilevich is a lawyer with 18 years of experience, well-known for representing victims of politically motivated prosecutions, including Ales Pushkin, a renowned Belarusian artist known for his criticism of the government.

In February 2022, the Hrodna region bar association disbarred Yurhilevich for “systematic violations of the law.” The disbarment was reportedly triggered by a complaint from the Hrodna region deputy prosecutor questioning her “professionalism.” Yurhilevich left the country following her disbarment.

In August 2022, when Yurhilevich returned to Belarus from Poland, authorities detained her and raided her apartment. On the same day, they detained Pavel Mazheika, an independent journalist and leader of the local independent group “City life center,” who had also just returned from Poland.

In July 2023, the Hrodna Regional Court sentenced Yurhilevich and Mazheika to six years in prison for “aiding extremist activities” under part 2 of 361-4 article of the Criminal Code. Both had pled not guilty.

The “extremism” charges stemmed from the fact that Yurhilevich had told Mazheika about her disbarment and shared with him the verdict in the case of Pushkin. The prosecution stated that this information was then passed on by Mazheika to Belsat, a Poland-based broadcaster deemed “extremist” by the authorities.

Authorities claimed that by sharing this information, Mazheika and Yurhilevich collaborated in “extremist activity” and “invalidated the values and goals of [Belarusian] society and the state” by “knowingly spreading false information.” Notification about Yurhilevich’s disbarment and license termination is publicly available on the Justice Ministry website. The details of Pushkin’s politically motivated trial and sentencing can be also easily found on a state media website.

Throughout the duration of their trial, Yurhilevich and Mazheika were held in a plexiglass cage. Yurhilevich wore a prison robe with a label “punishment cell N2” on the back, indicating she was being isolated as punishment during pre-trial detention. Presenting defendants to the court “in a manner indicating that they may be dangerous criminals” contradicts the principle of the presumption of innocence. Placement of Yurhilevich in a punishment cell, if arbitrary, amounts to ill-treatment.

On July 11, while Yurhilevich and Mazheika were still on trial, Pushkin died due to an untreated perforated ulcer in an intensive care unit, to which he had been transferred from Hrodna Prison N1. At time of writing, Yurhilevich was in Penal Colony N17 in Škłoŭ and Mazheika was in Penal Colony N2 in Babrujsk.

Other Cases

In September 2020, authorities detained and placed in pre-trial detention Illia Salei, a lawyer providing legal assistance to opposition politicians Babaryka, Kalesnikava, and Tsikhanouskaya on suspicion of “calling for actions aimed at instigating harm to the national security of Belarus.” In October, he was placed under house arrest. In April, a court in Minsk released him on bail. In August 2021, Salei secretly fled Belarus.

In June 2022, the Leninsky District Court in Minsk sentenced lawyer Andrei Machalau, who represented political prisoners, including activists and independent journalists, to two years of restriction of liberty (khimiya) in an open correctional facility under article 380 of the Criminal Code for supposedly forging the lawyer’s warrant in order to be able to participate in a trial.

In May 2021, the Minsk regional bar association disbarred Machalau for publicly commenting on police violence against his client and political prisoner, Volha Zalatar. However, the bar association did not notify Machalau of the final decision made by its council regarding his disbarment. As a result, Machalau showed up at a court hearing in his client’s case without knowing that he was already disbarred and believing that his warrant was still valid. In March 2023, Machalau fled Belarus following his release under an amnesty.

In February 2023, the Minsk Regional Court sentenced Dzmitry Pihul, a lawyer who had represented several political prisoners and was then detained by KGB officers in September 2022, to a fine of approximately US$7,000 on charges of “disclosing information from a preliminary investigation or a closed trial.”

In March 2023, the Leninsky District Court in Minsk sentenced Mikhail Makarau, a lawyer defending several clients in politically motivated cases including anarchist activists particularly targeted by authorities, to one year in prison for “organizing or preparing for acts, gravely violating public order, or active participation in such” under article 342 of the Criminal Code.

Authorities had first detained Makarau in September 2022, when GUBOPiK officers searched Makarau’s flat, and detained him and his wife Viktoryia Hulkova, also a lawyer. On September 14, pro-governmental Telegram channels published videos of Makarau, Hulkova, and Anastasiya Sahanovich, another lawyer representing anarchist activists detained on the same day, showing the three of them confessing to the crime of disseminating information on pre-trial investigations to their clients. A court sentenced Makarau to 15 days of arrest for supposed “dissemination of extremist materials.” He was then transferred to pre-trial detention on criminal charges under article 342. In June 2023, Mikhail Makarau was released from prison after serving his sentence in full.

In June 2023, the Minsk City Court sentenced lawyer Aliaksei Barodka, who represented clients in politically motivated cases, to six years in a penal colony with a heightened security regime on charges of “inciting hatred and enmity.” Barodka was first arrested in January 2023 and has been behind bars since then. The details of his case are unknown as his lawyer could not share relevant information for fear of breaching the non-disclosure notice. Barodka is also on the KGB list of “persons involved with terrorist activities.”

Threats and Harassment

Lawyers interviewed for this report spoke about the threats they faced from law enforcement officers, including threats to trump up charges against them and threats of retaliation against their family members.

Some of them also faced smear campaigns in state media and pro-government social media channels.

In November 2020, state-owned TV channel CTV broadcast a so-called “investigation” into the death of Raman Bandarenka, a protest activist who had died shortly after alleged plainclothes law enforcement officers brutally beat him for trying to talk them out of destroying a public mural in a Minsk courtyard. The author of the “investigation,” Ryhor Azaronak, a Belarusian TV presenter, alleged Bandarenka was drunk and died as a result of a “drunken brawl.”Azaronak also used snide and offense language in relation to Bandarenka’s family and their lawyer.

That same month, Andrei Mukavozchyk, a journalist with the state-run media outlet “Belarus Today,” wrote a smear piece about a lawyer who, in his words, “engaged in foul business” by representing a musician sentenced to administrative arrest for playing at a peaceful protest. In December, Mukavozchyk wrote another article about “bad apples” among lawyers, namely, those representing arbitrarily detained protesters or who sign public statements, talk to the mass media, or speak out on social media. Mukavozchyk named three lawyers, claiming they were liars, provided advice to terrorists, and acted without integrity.

At least one lawyer and one lawyer’s family member who taught at state universities had their job contracts discontinued after they had spoken out on politically sensitive issues or represented clients in politically motivated cases.

In April 2022, the Belarusian State University did not extend the contract of lawyer Aliaksandr Danilevich, whose subsequent politically motivated prosecution and imprisonment is detailed above, after he had signed a public petition of lawyers calling for an immediate end to hostilities in Ukraine and expressing disagreement with Belarus on allowing Russian troops to use its territory in Russia’s war in Ukraine. Prior to ending his contract, the university’s management tried talking Danilevich into removing his signature from the petition, but he refused. Danilevich had worked at the university’s law school for more than 20 years.

In April 2021, the Belarusian State University did not extend the contract of Alena Layeuskaya, the mother of Dzmitry Layeusky, who represented prominent political prisoners Babaryka and Znak. According to Layeusky, his mother was targeted as an act of retaliation for his work as a lawyer. In July 2021, Layeusky was disbarred by the council of the Minsk City Bar Association.

One of the ways for disbarred lawyers to continue working in the legal sphere in Belarus is to obtain a special license for providing legal services which, unlike a lawyers’ license, does not allow one to represent clients in court and only extends to legal work for business entities. In 2022, the Justice Ministry introduced a qualifications exam for obtaining such a license. According to the ministry, the license examination, among other things, helps the ministry to “promptly respond to possible facts of destructive behavior [by lawyers].” One lawyer said there was an “unspoken rule” that disbarred lawyers would not be allowed to obtain such a license and remain in the legal profession, albeit in a different capacity.

In September 2022, the Ministry of Internal Affairs designated the “Belarusian lawyers” Telegram chat as “extremist.” Created in the wake of the 2020 protests, the chat was used to promptly find lawyers for arbitrarily detained protestors and other critics of the government and to share information and experiences, including best practices, relating to representing clients in politically motivated cases.

In April 2024, the Central district court in Minsk labelled the Telegram channel of the Belarusian Association of Human Rights Lawyers as “extremist materials.”





IV. Dismantling the Independence of the Legal Profession – the Façade of Self-Governance

The self-governing bodies did not only withdraw from protecting the lawyers but got directly involved in acts of repression against them.

Since 2020, governmental control over the legal profession has fully crystalized as state policy in Belarus. Government officials present the work of lawyers as tasks assigned to them by the state and assert that included in the mission of lawyers is protecting the interests of the state.

In April 2022, Aliaksandr Lukashenka said, “it should be understood that [a lawyer] is a statesman.” He admitted to “actively intervening in and controlling” the work of the bar in Belarus and expressed “hope that the Justice Ministry will not only control but run the processes of the bar.” He also said that “[a lawyer’s] actions should not be based on “some made-up norms like freedom of speech, etc. We are done with this freedom.”

Justice Ministry Control over Self-Governing Bodies

The Justice Ministry is tasked with the general management of the bar in Belarus, which includes six regional bar associations and the Minsk City Bar Association, as well as the Belarusian Republican Bar Association (BRBA), which coordinates their work. The scope of the ministry’s control over the leadership and decisions of all bar associations, as well as its systematic interference with their internal processes after 2020, undermines international standards and Belarusian legislation, according to which bar associations should be self-governed and independent.

Belarusian law grants the Justice Ministry the power to suspend the decisions of bar association governing bodies it deems to have violated the law and to launch “inspections” of regional bar association activities.

The ministry also has control over the election of the regional bar’s chair, which represents and acts on behalf of the association, and is granted critical authority, including the authority to launch disciplinary proceedings against lawyers.

Major 2021 amendments to the Law on the Bar significantly expanded the state control over the bar. Already prior to the amendments, the ministry had the power to approve, decline, and suggest its own candidate for chair of the bar, as well as to call for the chair’s dismissal and even dismiss them independently if the bar’s rejection of the ministry’s initial appeal for dismissal was “unfounded.” According to the 2021 amendments, the candidate for chair of the bar suggested by the Justice Ministry is automatically selected if the bar twice declines the candidacy.

The Justice Ministry has used its authority to appoint bar chair candidates loyal to the state and to eliminate those considered unreliable. One lawyer interviewed for this report recalled that the ministry openly said there was “no point in nominating” certain candidates as the ministry “wouldn’t approve them in any case” due to the candidates’ position on sensitive issues.

Over the past three years, representatives of the Justice Ministry and other authorities consistently have been present at lawyers’ internal gatherings and planning meetings at the Republican and regional bar associations, which puts pressure on lawyers and the bar.

For instance, during a meeting of the Minsk Regional Bar Association in February 2021, the Justice Ministry representative in attendance said that lawyers who publicly speak out on sensitive topics, “should be gotten rid of like ballast.” In September 2022, the deputy justice minister told lawyers of the Homieĺ Regional Bar Association during their meeting that “a lawyer should fulfill the state’s functions and tasks.”

In October 2020, the BRBA published a statement saying that various state bodies, including the Justice Ministry, increasingly had filed complaints about lawyers criticizing them.

Role of the BRBA and Regional Bar Associations

The BRBA and regional bar associations since 2020 systematically have failed to represent and protect the interests of lawyers, particularly those defending clients in politically motivated cases or publicly speaking out on sensitive issues. Moreover, they have initiated disciplinary proceedings and otherwise retaliated against lawyers for earnestly carrying out their professional duties in politically motivated cases. This contradicts international standards on lawyers’ self-governing professional associations and Belarusian law, according to which the bar should represent and protect the interests of lawyers, including in relations with the authorities.

Crackdown on Freedom of Expression

Over the past three years, BRBA repeatedly has addressed lawyers in public statements, at closed meetings and with phone calls and letters discouraging them from speaking out on violations of the rights of their clients or commenting on politically sensitive issues. The regional bar associations have done the same. One lawyer said:

Both the Minsk Regional Bar Association and the BRBA repeatedly said we should not talk to mass media, “stay out of politics,” meaning that lawyers should not use all the tools available to them in order to defend their clients. The element of publicity is a particular red flag as far as they are concerned.

Lawyers have faced pressure from the Republican and regional bar associations after publishing posts and comments on social media, giving comments to independent media, signing petitions, and otherwise speaking out.

For instance, the BRBA published statements prohibiting lawyers from speaking about the political motivations behind prosecution of their clients, claiming that the term “political prisoner” raises questions about the professionalism of those lawyers and is damaging to the reputation of the legal profession. The BRBA also stressed that lawyers should “under no circumstances” talk about the fact that their clients face politically motivated charges.

In July 2022, BRBA chair Aliaksei Shvakau asserted that “protecting the interests of the state and the society is a lawyer’s duty.” The BRBA warned lawyers it would not be able to protect them if they commit “discrediting” acts such as criticizing state bodies and officials without confirmation by “court rulings or other trustworthy sources.” In another statement, the BRBA said it was “unacceptable” to talk about systematic failures based on violations by some law enforcement officers. In June 2022, Shvakau claimed that “problems arise when lawyers comment on events that fall outside of their professional activities, engaging in populism and politicking.”

On several occasions, Shvakau stated that bar associations cooperate and “work closely together” with state bodies to identify unwanted publications by lawyers on social media “which allows them to deal with this tendency.”

In September 2022, the Minsk City Bar Association held a meeting on “discipline and public safety” due to the “unacceptable behavior of certain lawyers violating the Rules of Professional Ethics.” During the meeting, Shvakau stressed that communications with persons and entities involved with extremist activities or dissemination of extremist materials is unacceptable for lawyers. In Belarus, all major independent media outlets and human rights organizations have been declared extremist by the authorities.

Moreover, lawyers said that the former chair of the BRBA. Viktar Chaichyts, encouraged some of them to write loyalist posts on social media to appear “law abiding” ahead of their re-certification procedure at the Justice Ministry’s Qualification Commission, implying that this would improve their chances. For instance, one lawyer was advised to describe mass peaceful protests as illegal and to call on peaceful protestors to stop their activities in order to show they “were ready to educate [the public] and think the right way.”

Regional bar associations are required by Belarusian law to be members of the BRBA, which has a great degree of control over them, including the power to suspend the decisions of regional bars’ self-governing bodies, dismiss their chairs, and hold disciplinary proceedings against chairs and members of the regional bar associations’ councils.

The BRBA chair repeatedly has put pressure on the councils of the regional bar associations to “continuously monitor publications by lawyers online” and take preventative actions to ensure that lawyers do not speak to independent media or otherwise step out of line.

In March 2021, at the Minsk City Bar Association’s conference, the then BRBA chair Chaichyts praised the bar for “doing a lot” to “indoctrinate” and “stop lawyers from making these political statements, political slogans” and called on lawyers to avoid signing public petitions.

During the conference at the Minsk Regional Bar Association in January 2022, the BRBA deputy chair said that bar association self-governing bodies and lawyers were “guilty of failing to stop certain colleagues from wrong actions.”

In June 2022, the head of the Minsk City Bar Association, Vera Areshka, claimed that “recalling the events of 2020, some publications and statements of certain colleagues turned out to be false.” She also claimed that some lawyers “overstepped the boundaries of their profession by openly expressing their position [on 2020 events].”

Chairs of other regional bar associations, for instance, the chair of Hrodna Regional Bar Association, told lawyers to “avoid radical political statements in mass media,” make comments based only on “law, official statistics, or court rulings” and claimed that the quieter a lawyer is in politically motivated cases, the better.

Both the BRBA and regional bar associations increasingly transmit state ideology on historic and geopolitical issues, such as justifying and supporting Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and expressing approval of Aliaksandr Lukashenka ’s policies. Furthermore, lawyers are forced by the bar to take part in events in support of the state and give lectures that promote the state agenda. If lawyers refuse to take part in such events

or attend lectures, they may be flagged by the head of their legal consultation office or bar association and face disciplinary sanctions.

Failure of the Bar to Represent and Protect the Interests of Lawyers

Lawyers said that while the BRBA took some limited actions to address some of the lawyers’ rights violations in the first months following the 2020 protests, the BRBA generally has failed to react in a meaningful way to abuses of lawyers’ rights and the rights of their clients.

In December 2020, officers of the Department of Financial Investigations searched the home of Ala Sharko, journalist and program director at Belarus Press Club, an independent organization working to protect press freedoms. When her lawyer Siarhiei Zikratski arrived at the scene, officers pushed him away, preventing him from entering the apartment. A journalist, also present at the scene, wrote about the incident.

Two days later, the BRBA published a statement saying that publicly exposing supposed violations of lawyers’ rights could lead to “negative consequences” for the lawyer, including potential disbarment, as well as harm to the lawyer’s client and the legal profession as a whole.

Other lawyers said that the BRBA and regional bar associations failed to react to lawyers’ appeals regarding serious violations of their rights, such as denial of access to clients, breach of confidentiality, smear campaigns, or politically motivated prosecution.

In May 2022, the disciplinary commission of the Minsk regional bar association decided to disbar lawyer Andrei Machalau, who represented political prisoners, because he spoke to the media about the police severely beating his client. The commission told Machalau that, as stipulated by the law, his status as a lawyer would continue to be in force for a month or so, until the Minsk City Bar made the final decision on his disbarment. However, when Machalau showed up at his client’s trial three weeks later, he was told that the council had already made the final decision, albeit they had not notified him. Soon after, authorities opened a criminal case against Machalau for “forging” his lawyer’s warrant.

During Machalau’s trial, Iryna Smirnova, the former chair of the Minsk regional bar association, and Maksim Tserashkou, the then current chair, testified against Machalau, claiming that his warrant had been invalid once the disciplinary commission had taken its decision, and that Machalau therefore knowingly showed up with invalid warrant. The chairs’ testimonies led to the court’s decision to sentence Machalau to two years of restriction of liberty (khimiya).

Repression Initiated by the Bar

Since 2020, the BRBA has increasingly initiated ad hoc re-certification procedures through the Justice Ministry’s Qualification Commission. The re-certifications have come at the initiative of the regional bar associations after they claimed to have found violations during their inspections of a lawyer’s work. One lawyer said:

The regional bar associations were made aware [by the government] of the fact that now they should be the ones initiating the disbarment procedure. At hoc re-certifications used to take place following inspections by the Justice Ministry, now the bar associations initiate inspections themselves. Then they pass information on to the BRBA which formally launches the re-certification. This is a way to get rid of “undesirables”.

Lawyers noted that the “violations” found during inspections are usually very minor and are used as a formal pretext for launching re-certification. Such violations have included, for instance, using the word “visit” instead of “meeting” with a client in the lawyers’ warrant.

(Nairobi) – The Democratic Republic of Congo government should ensure that those who took part in an attempted coup are prosecuted in fair trials, Human Rights Watch said today. The authorities should also thoroughly and impartially investigate and appropriately prosecute security forces’ alleged extrajudicial killings of coup participants.

Details are still emerging about the attempted coup by a group of about 50 Congolese and foreigners in Kinshasa, the capital, on May 19, 2024. Media reports indicate the attempted coup led to the deaths of at least two security guards and one civilian and that the security forces killed several coup participants. At least two coup participants may have been killed while trying to escape custody.

“The government both has a responsibility to ensure the security of the country and to hold those responsible for the coup attempt accountable, based on international fair trial standards,” said Lewis Mudge, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “The government’s response needs to be rights-respecting, which includes impartially investigating possible security force involvement in alleged summary executions.”

Christian Malanga, a US-based Congolese opponent of the government, the self-proclaimed “President of New Zaire,” and head of a government in exile, allegedly led the coup. Malanga, his son, and other coup participants breached the Palais de la Nation (Palace of the Nation) in Kinshasa, which serves as the president’s office. The coup participants allegedly attacked the residences of the prime minister, the defense minister, and another senior politician.

Congolese security forces killed Malanga in unclear circumstances hours after he seized the Palais de la Nation.

President Félix Tshisekedi was sworn in on January 20 for a second term, after December 2023 elections marred by logistical issues, irregularities, and violence. Tshisekedi has since been unable to form a government despite holding a majority in parliament.

Media reports indicate that at least three US nationals, including Malanga’s son Marcel, participated in the failed coup. US Ambassador Lucy Tamlyn, in a statement on X (formerly Twitter), said that the US will “cooperate with the DRC authorities to the fullest extent as they investigate these criminal acts and hold accountable any US citizen.” US authorities should also investigate and appropriately prosecute any coup participant who may have violated US law, Human Rights Watch said.

Malanga livestreamed the attack on the Palais de la Nation on his Facebook account. The original livestream is no longer available. However, Human Rights Watch verified a copy of the livestream shared elsewhere online and geolocated it to the palace. It shows Malanga and a small group of armed men walking around the grounds issuing proclamations.

Human Rights Watch also geolocated two videos taken by Congolese soldiers and shared widely on social media on May 21. Human Rights Watch determined that one showed an area on the banks of the Congo River approximately 185 meters from the dock leading to the Palais de la Nation. In it, seven men in civilian dress or without clothing, including one Caucasian man without clothing who is believed to be a foreigner participating in the coup, are in and around a boat, along with six men in Congolese military fatigues. A soldier shoots twice at one of the presumed coup participants, who then lies motionless. One of the men jumps into the river in an attempt to flee. The soldiers shoot at him several dozen times until a pool of blood appears in the water and he no longer comes up for air. A soldier shouts: “He is dead!” and the firing stops.

In the second video, filmed on a dock outside the Palais de la Nation, seven soldiers, six of whom are wearing red berets associated with the Republican Guard, the presidential security detail, lead a bloodied foreigner and Malanga's son toward the palace. The Caucasian man, who is wearing clothes, repeatedly says “no weapon” as the soldiers search him.

Congolese authorities should enforce the absolute prohibition on torture and ill-treatment of any detainee and investigate possible extrajudicial executions by security forces, Human Rights Watch said. The attempted coup came after a prolonged period during which the Congolese government had significantly repressed the rights to free expression, media freedom, and peaceful assembly. Since 2020, the authorities have increasingly cracked down on journalists, human rights and democracy activists, critics of the government, and opposition party members and officials. Security forces have repeatedly used unnecessary or excessive force, including lethal force, to block or disperse peaceful demonstrations.

The attempted coup occurred at a time when armed conflict in eastern Congo has intensified as Rwandan-backed M23 rebels continue to seize territory around Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.

West and Central Africa have experienced a spate of coups over the last few years, posing concerns for democratic institutions and upending the peaceful transfer of power. The African Union and several African governments have condemned the attempted coup. The AU Constitutive Act and the Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance support sanctions against unconstitutional changes of government.

“Congo and the region have a legacy of coups and attempted coups,” Mudge said. “The Congolese government needs to treat this crisis as an opportunity to demonstrate its commitment to human rights and the rule of law.”",HIGH,20240527T104500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Christian Malanga, Marcel Malanga, President Félix Tshisekedi, Lewis Mudge, US Ambassador Lucy Tamlyn",Congolese security forces,"Palais de la Nation, Kinshasa",Ensure fair trials and investigate security forces' actions,Extrajudicial killings of coup participants,Democratic Republic of Congo,"Repressed rights to free expression, media freedom, and peaceful assembly; armed conflict in eastern Congo"

Update, May 28, 2024: After publication of this news release, Volkswagen responded to earlier questions from Human Rights Watch, saying that the small electronic part produced by a sub-supplier listed by US authorities in December 2023 as linked to Uyghur forced labor had been replaced “in all cars for sale globally.” Volkswagen also responded to a question about why Volkswagen’s previous investigations in 2020 and 2022 did not identify a link to the sub-supplier, stating: “We investigated as part of our processes if a direct business relationship exists. This was and is still not the case. The connection to one of our sub-suppliers was not identified, as no full supply chain transparency exists.”

(Berlin) – Volkswagen should inform shareholders at its May 29, 2024 annual general meeting how the company plans to eliminate Uyghur forced labor in its operations and supply chains, Human Rights Watch and the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR) said today.

Since 2017, the Chinese government has perpetrated crimes against humanity in the northwestern Xinjiang region and subjected Uyghurs and other Turkic communities to forced labor inside and outside the region. Aluminum and other key materials used in car manufacturing are produced in Xinjiang by companies with links to government forced labor programs.

“Volkswagen’s ‘In China, for China’ strategy shouldn’t mean complicity in forced labor,” said Jim Wormington, senior researcher and advocate for corporate accountability at Human Rights Watch. “Shareholders should call upon Volkswagen to ensure that it will apply robust measures to tackle Uyghur forced labor in its supply chains.”

Volkswagen, which manufactures cars in China through joint ventures with Chinese carmakers, is failing to adequately investigate potential links between its supply chains in China and forced labor. The company in 2023 also commissioned a deeply flawed audit at a plant in Xinjiang operated by a subsidiary of Volkswagen’s joint venture with SAIC, a Chinese state-owned carmaker. The Chinese government’s pervasive surveillance and repression in Xinjiang means audits cannot credibly verify whether the facilities in the region are free from forced labor.

Volkswagen sells one in three of its cars in China. Volkswagen’s chief executive, Oliver Blume, on April 24 described China as the company’s “second home market.” Blume also announced the company’s updated “In China, for China” strategy, which includes expanded partnerships with Chinese car manufacturers, reduced manufacturing costs, and ambitious sales targets.

Volkswagen said in December 2023 that an audit overseen by Markus Löning, Germany’s former commissioner for human rights, found “no indications” of forced labor at the Xinjiang joint venture plant, which is used to road test cars assembled elsewhere in China. Löning conceded, however, that the basis for the audit had been a review of documentation rather than interviews with workers, which he said could be “dangerous.” He also said that “even if they [workers] would be aware of something, they cannot say that in an interview.”

Following the release of the audit, the German newspaper Handelsblatt on February 14 alleged that a contractor of a SAIC-Volkswagen Xinjiang subsidiary had used Uyghur forced labor during the construction of a Xinjiang test track, which was completed in 2019. In response, Volkswagen said that the 2023 audit of the Xinjiang plant did not include the test track, but that “to date, we have had no indications of human rights violations in connection with the test site.”

Volkswagen also said in February that it is “currently in talks with the non-controlled joint venture SAIC-Volkswagen regarding the future direction of the JVs [joint ventures] business activities in Xinjiang Province. Various scenarios are currently being examined intensively.” Shareholders should ask Volkswagen about the outcome of those discussions and push for the company to end its joint venture operations in Xinjiang.

The production of key materials for car manufacturing in Xinjiang also creates a risk that Volkswagen is sourcing products or materials linked to forced labor, both in factories across China and globally. Nearly 10 percent of the world’s aluminum, for example, is produced in Xinjiang before being shipped out, melted down, and made into products and parts used by car manufacturers and other industries. Aluminum producers in Xinjiang, and in the coal mines and coal plants that supply them, have participated in coercive labor transfers, a form of state-imposed forced labor.

In June 2023, ECCHR filed a complaint with the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control (Bundesamt für Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle, BAFA), the German government authority overseeing the country’s Supply Chain Act. The complaint contends that Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz are violating their obligations under the law by failing to adopt appropriate measures to identify and prevent the risks of state-imposed forced labor in their supply chains. The BAFA has not yet responded publicly to the complaint.

Volkswagen in January told United States customs officials that a small electronic part was produced by a sub-supplier listed by US authorities in December 2023 as linked to Uyghur forced labor. US customs officials impounded vehicles containing the part while Volkswagen replaced it. Human Rights Watch asked Volkswagen on May 22 whether it has removed the part in vehicles sold outside the US but did not receive a response. A US Senate Finance Committee report in May found that Volkswagen had previously investigated the sub-supplier in 2020 and 2022 but found no connections to its supply chain.

Volkswagen is applying inadequate oversight to the supply chains of its Chinese joint ventures, such as SAIC-VW, which primarily manufacture cars for sale in China, the organizations said. Volkswagen contends that, under Germany’s supply chain law, it is not legally required to address human rights impacts in SAIC-VW’s supply chain because its joint venture agreement cedes operational control to SAIC.

Volkswagen in November 2023 told Human Rights Watch that the company “assumes responsibility … to use its leverage over its Chinese joint ventures to address the risk of human rights abuses.” But when asked about potential links between SAIC-Volkswagen and an aluminum producer in Xinjiang, Volkswagen responded: “We have no transparency about the supplier relationships of the non-controlled shareholding SAIC-Volkswagen.”

Volkswagen’s updated China strategy continues to rely on joint ventures and includes partnerships with SAIC and Chinese electric carmaker XPENG. ECCHR’s complaint said that cars manufactured by joint ventures should be considered as being part of Volkswagen’s supply chain, and therefore fall within the scope of its due diligence obligation under the German Supply Chain Act. Human Rights Watch asked Volkswagen on May 22 what steps it will take to ensure that strong human rights and responsible-sourcing standards apply to all current and future joint venture operations in China, but did not receive a reply.

“Volkswagen can’t simply wash its hands of responsibility for its Chinese joint ventures in full knowledge of the risks of forced labor,” said Chloé Bailey, senior legal advisor at ECCHR. “Shareholders should ask Volkswagen how it is responding to increased scrutiny over its operations in China and what steps it is taking to comply with its obligations under the German Supply Chain Act.”",VERY HIGH,20240527T050000Z,"Human Rights Watch, ECCHR","Oliver Blume, Markus Löning",Volkswagen,"Xinjiang, China",Volkswagen needs to ensure transparency and responsibility in supply chains to address risks of forced labor.,Complicity in forced labor linked to Uyghurs and Turkic communities in Xinjiang,China,Chinese government policies on forced labor

(Nairobi) – Those responsible for a brutal attack 10 years ago on a Central African Republic church serving as a camp for displaced people still need to face justice, Human Rights Watch said today.

The May 28, 2014 attack at the Notre-Dame church in the Fatima neighborhood of the country’s capital, Bangui, took place less than a kilometer from African Union (AU) peacekeeping forces and is emblematic of the impunity that has enabled violence between rival armed groups to continue in the country for over a decade.

After the attack, Human Rights Watch confirmed that 17 people had been killed in the camp, allegedly by fighters aligned with the Seleka, a predominantly Muslim coalition of armed groups. However, the tally was most likely higher as some victims were buried immediately. The nearby AU peacekeeping mission did not provide security to the camp before the attack.

“The 2014 Fatima massacre was an egregious attack on civilians in the capital that highlights the problems international peacekeepers face in the Central African Republic,” said Lewis Mudge, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “Even years later, delivering justice now will send a powerful signal that while justice may take time, it will catch up with those responsible for the crimes.”

The attack falls within a broader pattern of violence in the country that the Seleka started a decade ago. Christian anti-balaka militias rose across the country in response to the Seleka and quickly began to target Muslim civilians, associating them with the Seleka coalition.

The Fatima massacre is being investigated by the Special Criminal Court (SCC) in Bangui. In 2022, four armed group leaders aligned with the Seleka – Gary Hadiatou, Ali Abdel Kader, Oumar Al Bachir, and Yalo Amadou – were arrested in connection to the case. They have been charged with multiple counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes.

In January 2023, the court’s deputy special prosecutor told the media that a trial could open in the first quarter of that year. The trial never did, and in June 2023, the court informed the media that one of the accused, Al Bachir, had died in hospital. This, coupled with the court’s requirement that pretrial detention cannot exceed three years, underscores the urgency for the trial to start.

The special court was established to investigate and prosecute serious international crimes committed in Central African Republic since 2003. It is staffed by national and international judges and personnel. Since it began operations in 2018, it has completed the prosecution of one case involving crimes in the northwestern part of the country in 2019. A second trial, started in December 2023, is ongoing.

The court recently issued an arrest warrant against former president François Bozizé for crimes against humanity allegedly committed between February 2009 and March 23, 2013, by the Presidential Guard and other security services under his responsibility at the Bossembelé military training center, referred to as “Guantanamo,” north of Bangui.

A family member of a victim of the killings in Fatima recently told Human Rights Watch: “Ten years later, we are still awaiting justice, we hope it comes soon.”

The Notre-Dame church in Fatima served as a camp for thousands of residents of Bangui displaced after the anti-balaka attacked the capital on December 5, 2013, prompting waves of violence and revenge killings. At least 7,000 people were at the camp on the day of the attack.

The attack came after months of tit-for-tat killings between anti-balaka and armed Muslims, some of whom were aligned with Seleka groups, from the Kilomètre 5 neighborhood, which borders Fatima.

On May 28, 2014, Seleka attackers from Kilomètre 5 arrived at the church. One witness told Human Rights Watch, “I saw more than 30 men on the road with guns, running to us. Since it was daylight, I could see them attacking. They did not hide their faces.”

Witnesses and survivors described a scene of total chaos as thousands tried to escape or hide. Some survivors piled into outdoor concrete pews behind the church.

The attackers entered the church from different directions. Multiple survivors and witnesses said that the attackers were armed with Kalashnikovs, grenades, and machetes. Many people recognized some of the attackers as Seleka fighters from Kilomètre 5.

A relative of Héritier Moket, a 15-year-old who was killed, said, “I was still in front of the church with Héritier; my wife and kids had already run behind the church. I saw the attackers coming and I told him to run. We were running around trying to escape but he was shot.”

Another survivor, who was badly injured on his face and arm by machetes, said he had been surrounded by about nine men. He said: “I put my hands up but they were already attacking. They asked in Arabic if I was an anti-balaka. I can speak some Arabic [so I told them I was not]. They said nothing, they just started striking me with machetes. I fell to the ground and was hit in the head until I lost consciousness, and they thought I was already dead.”

Another survivor, who was shot in the stomach, said, “I jumped into a toilet to hide and just a few seconds later they shot at it. A bullet went through my arm and entered my abdomen on the left side.”

Impunity for those responsible for serious crimes in Central African Republic has fueled recurring cycles of violence and emboldened armed groups to continue to commit atrocities, leaving trails of death, displacement, and destitution, Human Rights Watch said.

The attack at Fatima was among the first in a long line of egregious attacks on camps for the internally displaced in the country. The Notre-Dame church continued to serve as a displacement camp and was attacked again in 2018, when at least 16 people were killed and many others wounded.

“Central Africans have waited for a decade to see justice for brutal killings in Fatima and the Special Criminal Court holds the promise of delivering it,” Mudge said. “The government and the court’s international partners should step up their efforts to support the court to ensure that it can effectively execute its crucial mandate.”",VERY HIGH,20240530T084500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Gary Hadiatou, Ali Abdel Kader, Oumar Al Bachir, Yalo Amadou",Seleka fighters,"Notre-Dame church, Fatima neighborhood, Bangui",Support for the Special Criminal Court and its efforts to deliver justice,Brutal attack resulting in the deaths of civilians during an attack on a displacement camp,Central African Republic,"Long-standing violence between armed groups, impunity for crimes committed"

Dear Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa,

On May 20, the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor, Karim Khan, applied to the court’s judges for arrest warrants against three Hamas leaders (Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Diab Ibrahim Al-Masri – more commonly known as Deif – and Ismail Haniyeh) and two senior Israeli officials (Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant) for alleged crimes committed since October 7, 2023, in relation to his ongoing Palestine investigation.

We, the undersigned Japanese NGOs, urge Japan, as an ICC member committed to a rules-based international order, to protect the court’s independence and publicly condemn efforts to intimidate or interfere with the court’s work, its officials, and those cooperating with the institution.

On April 24, 12 US senators wrote to Khan, threatening to end all US support to the ICC, sanction the institution and its officials, and bar the prosecutor and court staff from entering the United States if steps were taken to pursue warrants against Israeli officials. US congress members have also introduced legislation aimed at imposing sanctions on ICC officials. The speaker of the House of Representatives has called on the Biden administration to “immediately and unequivocally demand that the ICC stand down and the US should use every available tool to prevent such an abomination.”

Meanwhile, there have been reports that the Israeli government was seeking support from ICC member countries and other governments in opposing the Office of the Prosecutor’s ongoing Palestine investigation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also publicly denounced the ICC and called on governments to thwart the court’s efforts to scrutinize Israeli actions. In response to these attacks, the Prosecutor’s Office issued a statement on May 3 noting the court’s jurisdiction over offenses against the administration of justice and “insist[ing] that all attempts to impede, intimidate, or improperly influence its officials cease immediately.”

The presidency of the ICC's governing body, the Assembly of States Parties (ASP), has called for respect for the court’s independence in the wake of these latest threats. This is not the first time the ICC has faced politicized opposition. As you know, the former US administration abused its sanctions regime against the prosecutor’s predecessor in a bid to undermine or deter investigations that could implicate US or Israeli nationals. At the time, 67 member countries, the ASP President, and nongovernmental organizations spoke out for the court. When the current US administration lifted the sanctions in 2021, Japan welcomed the move. Similarly, following its issuance of an arrest warrant for Russian president Vladmir Putin as part of the prosecutor’s ongoing Ukraine investigation, in 2023, Russia issued arrest warrants against the Khan and six of the court’s judges, including current ICC President Tomoko Akane. Russian lawmakers have also enacted a law criminalizing cooperation with the ICC. Member countries, including Japan, and the ASP presidency publicly condemned these attacks against the court.

The ICC plays an essential role as a court of last resort to deliver justice to victims of the world’s worst crimes. ICC members like Japan have a responsibility to protect the court’s impartiality and independence across all situations on its docket.

We took note of the statement delivered by Japan and Switzerland on May 14, on behalf of ICC members on the UN Security Council, reiterating their commitment to uphold and defend the values of the Rome Statute, “undeterred by threats and measures against the Court, its officials, and those cooperating with it.”

We urge Japan to make clear that the court’s judges have full support in undertaking their independent examination of the prosecutor’s applications for arrest warrants in the Palestine situation. We also look for your public support for arrest warrants the court may issue, commit to working to ensure the execution of such warrants, and press Palestinian and Israeli authorities to cooperate with the court.

Regrettably, many ICC members were initially silent on the importance of pursuing accountability and justice before the court for both Israeli and Palestinian victims, who have faced a wall of impunity for decades. This has led to perceptions of double standards, putting the ICC’s legitimacy at risk. It is crucial that the ICC can investigate and prosecute grave international crimes across all situations under its jurisdiction.

Whether the ICC can meaningfully and effectively deliver on its mandate will largely depend on the will of the international community and ICC member countries like Japan to support impartial and independent justice no matter where the abuses are committed and by whom. We urge you to make clear that your government stands with those who seek justice for grave human rights crimes, not those who threaten and harass the prosecutors and judges who aim to bring those committed serious human rights abuses to justice.

Sincerely,

In a rare piece of good news for human rights and democracy in the United Kingdom, last week the High Court ruled that anti-protest measures introduced by the government earlier this year are unlawful. The case was brought by Liberty, a UK-based civil liberties organization, who hailed the decision as a “victory for democracy.”

Last June, then Home Secretary Suella Braverman substantially increased police powers by lowering the threshold at which police could intervene in protests, from those causing “serious disruption” to causing “more than minor” disruption. As a result, hundreds of protesters have been arrested, including climate activist Greta Thunberg, who was acquitted of all charges in February.

Controversially, the House of Lords had already rejected the amendment months earlier, during the passage of the Public Order Act 2023. Rather than resubmitting it for Parliament’s reconsideration, Braverman forced the change through using so-called Henry VIII powers, controversial clauses that enable ministers to amend an Act of Parliament without needing Parliamentary approval: a move Liberty director Akiko Hart described as attempting to get “dangerous powers … sneaked through the back door.”

In its 56-page ruling, the High Court ruled that the Home Secretary did not have the power to lower the threshold. The court also ruled that the Home Office had acted unlawfully by not consulting groups likely to be impacted by the new powers, preferring to consult only what Liberty described as “a narrow group of stakeholders” in an “unfair” and “one-sided” process.

While this ruling is to be celebrated, it is a silver lining in an otherwise overcast rights landscape in the UK. The same day the judgment was delivered, severe new anti-protest measures were recommended by the government’s advisor on political violence. If adopted, these would have a dramatic impact on an already shrinking civic space.

The right to protest has been under sustained attack in the UK for several years and urgent action is required to reverse a trend that has already been disastrous for rights.

(Beirut) – Tunisian authorities have ramped up their crackdown on media and freedom of expression in recent weeks, sentencing two journalists and a media founder to prison sentences, detaining another media figure, and intimidating private media, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said today. The authorities should immediately release those detained and drop all prosecutions for expression protected under international human rights law.

In the lead-up to Tunisia’s first presidential election since President Kais Saied’s July 2021 power grab, expected to be held in the fall, the Tunisian authorities have escalated their repression of free speech under Decree-Law 2022-54 on Cybercrime as well as other archaic laws. Simultaneously, they have clamped down on civil society groups, especially those defending migrants and refugees’ rights against the backdrop of the EU migration deal, leading to an unprecedented shrinking of civic space since the 2011 revolution.

“By attacking journalists and other media figures, Saied’s government is moving to put the last nail in the coffin of Tunisia’s civic space,” said Lama Fakih, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “After undermining the judiciary, jailing several dozen opponents and critics and attacking civil society organizations, Saied is now targeting the media.”

“Tunisian authorities are methodically annihilating the last remaining gains of the 2011 revolution: freedom of expression and the press,” said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa director. “Ahead of the elections, the government should ensure that all Tunisians are able to freely express their views without fear of retaliation, and that independent media are able to conduct their reporting free from harassment or intimidation and broadcast open discussions.”

Based on Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International’s count, over 70 people, including political opponents, lawyers, journalists, activists, human rights defenders, and social media users have been subjected to arbitrary prosecutions since the end of 2022. At least 40 remain arbitrarily detained as of May 2024, with most of them held in connection with the exercise of their internationally protected rights.

On May 22, the Tunis First Instance Court sentenced Borhen Bsaies and Mourad Zeghidi, both prominent journalists, to a year in prison under article 24 of Decree-Law 2022-54, in separate cases. The next day, the same court handed a media founder and tech activist a nine-month suspended prison sentence in relation to his online expression after detaining him for 11 days.

Tunisian security forces arrested Bsaies and Zeghidi separately on the evening of May 11. Based on the police report seen by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, Bsaies, who anchors two primetime talk shows on private TV and radio channels, was questioned about statements he made on the radio and on TV between 2020 and 2023, including comments on the dissolution of the High Judicial Council by President Saied in February 2022, among other topics. He was also questioned about social media posts that the police deemed to be critical of President Saied. Ghazi Mrabet, Zeghidi’s lawyer, said that police confronted him with nine video clips of statements made between February and April 2024, and they questioned Zeghidi’s Facebook post supporting an investigative journalist, Mohamed Boughalleb, who is serving a six-month sentence for publicly questioning a government ministry’s public spending.

On May 11, Sonia Dahmani, a lawyer and media commentator and Bsaies’ and Zeghidi’s colleague on the popular daily program “Emission Impossible” on the private radio station IFM, was also arrested under Decree-Law 2022-54. Dozens of masked plain clothes security forces stormed the headquarters of the Tunisian bar association and arrested her for sarcastic comments made on the private TV channel Carthage+ on May 7 questioning the claim that Black African migrants were seeking to settle in Tunisia. On May 13, an investigative judge in the Tunis Court of First Instance ordered her pretrial detention and on May 20 the same judge rejected a release request submitted by Dahmani’s lawyer. Dahmani is facing investigation in two prior separate Decree-Law 2022-54 cases for her public comments, based on complaints by the General Prison Directorate and justice minister.

Masked officers also attacked France 24 correspondents Maryline Dumas and Hamdi Tlili, who were broadcasting Dahmani’s arrest live, and broke their camera. Tlili was briefly arrested and beaten.

Decree-Law 2022-54 on Cybercrime, issued by President Saied in September 2022, violates the right to privacy and introduces harsh sentences for broadly and vaguely defined speech offenses. The authorities have frequently used article 24 of this decree to stifle dissent. Article 24 stipulates a five-year prison sentence and a fine of up to TND 50,000 (about US$16,000) for using telecommunications networks to produce, send, or disseminate “fake news” or “rumors;” to harm, defame, or incite violence against others; or to undermine public safety or national defense, spread fear, or incite hatred. The sentence is doubled if the offense targets a “public official or equivalent.”

Tunisian authorities should repeal Decree-Law 2022-54, along with vague or overbroad provisions of other existing codes that have been used to criminalize free expression, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said.

Indirectly referring to recent arrests, Saied said on May 15 in a meeting with his justice minister that “those who denigrate their country in the media ... cannot remain unaccountable and unpunished.” Between May 13 and 16, at least three representatives of private media outlets were summoned for questioning as part of various investigations, based on media reports. They include IFM’s director, who was asked about the radio station’s editorial line; Diwan FM’s editor-in-chief, who said he had been questioned about a comment made in 2020; and a Carthage+ executive.

In 2023, Zied el-Heni, a former “Emission Impossible” journalist, since fired, was arrested in June and again in December in two separate cases in connection with critical comments he made on the air. On January 10, 2024, he was sentenced to a six-month suspended prison term for “insulting” the trade minister under article 86 of the Telecommunications Code, his lawyer Ayachi Hammami told Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International.

Article 86 of the Telecommunications Code, which the authorities have long weaponized to stifle freedom of expression, carries a penalty of up to two years in prison.

Mohamed Boughalleb, another journalist, has been detained since March 22 for questioning the size of the religious affairs minister’s delegations during his official trips abroad on his Facebook page and on Carthage+ and Cap FM radio station in February and March, his lawyer, Anas Kaddoussi, told Human Rights Watch. On April 17, Boughalleb, who was sued by an official of the Religious Affairs Ministry, was sentenced to six months in prison for defaming an official under article 128 of the penal code. Since April 5, Boughalleb has been detained in a separate Decree-Law 2022-54 case also in connection with public statements, Kaddoussi said.

Similarly, journalist Chadha Hadj Mbarek has been detained since July 20, 2023, for her work for the digital content production company Instalingo. Hadj Mbarek, whose main role was to produce lifestyle content for a Facebook page, was accused of “undermining external security” under article 61-bis of Tunisia’s penal code, her lawyer, Malek Ben Amor, told Human Rights Watch.

(Kyiv, May 29, 2024) – A recent Russian cluster munition strike on Odesa, Ukraine, that killed seven civilians and injured dozens more highlights the urgent need for all countries to join the international treaty banning these weapons, Human Rights Watch said today.

“Russia’s cluster munition strikes on Ukraine are a case study of the grave harm posed to civilians,” said Belkis Wille, associate crisis, conflict, and arms director at Human Rights Watch. “The many countries that have banned cluster munitions under the treaty have made great strides destroying stockpiles and clearing explosive remnants, but the continued use of these weapons increases the risk to civilians everywhere.”

Sixteen years on, 124 countries have ratified the May 30, 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions but not Russia and Ukraine.

On April 29, 2024, a ballistic missile equipped with a cluster munition warhead scattered its payload of submunitions in and around one of the Odesa Legal Academy’s compounds on Odesa’s waterfront. Ukrainian authorities reported that among the civilians killed was a 4-year-old girl, who died of her injuries three weeks after the attack. The detonations started a fire that destroyed the roof of the residence of the Legal Academy’s president, who was injured in the attack.

Another 28 civilians were wounded, including a pregnant woman and a child. Most victims were in a popular park outside one of the academy’s buildings, which feature a seafront promenade used by joggers, dog walkers, and other civilians.

Cluster munitions are inherently indiscriminate weapons that pose a foreseeable and long-lasting danger to civilians. Delivered by artillery, rockets, missiles, and aircraft, cluster munitions open in mid-air to disperse multiple submunitions over an area the size of several city blocks. Many submunitions fail to explode on impact, leaving duds that can wound and kill like landmines for years, until they are located and destroyed.

The Ukrainian prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin, said that Russian forces carried out the attack using an Iskandar ballistic missile equipped with a cluster munition warhead. Dmytro Pletenchyk, a Ukrainian military spokesperson, said he immediately visited the site of the attack and observed remnants of the missile and the explosive submunitions it carried. Each Iskander-M 9M723-series ballistic missile contains 54 9N730 dual-purpose submunitions.

A security camera video of the attack posted to Facebook by Kostin on April 30 and verified by Human Rights Watch as taken on the Odesa waterfront near the academy shows at least 25 small explosions in under six seconds, indicative of the detonation of multiple submunitions from a cluster munition attack.

Human Rights Watch verified six videos and photographs from the attack and its aftermath posted on social media, including blood splatter and fragmentation damage caused by a detonation on the pavement, the fire at the legal academy, and remnants of the munition from the attack. One photograph shows production markings on a remnant of the missile’s engine section, identifying the weapon used as a 9M723 ballistic missile. Only Russia produces and stockpiles Iskander ballistic missiles equipped with cluster munition warheads.

Denys Sebov, the director of City Clinical Hospital No. 10 in Odesa, told Human Rights Watch that 15 injured people were transported there after the attack, all with injuries caused by metal fragments. He said that of those brought to the hospital, one 40-year-old woman died on arrival from fragmentation injuries to her neck, lungs, and heart; a 30-year-old man died of head trauma; and another man died after surgeons removed two fragments from his head. Some survivors were transferred to other medical institutions for further surgery.

Russian missiles and drones have regularly targeted Odesa’s port infrastructure. However, the April 29 strike site is eight kilometers from the port and not known to be close to any military objective, such as military buildings or supply storehouses.

Human Rights Watch has documented many Russian cluster munition attacks that have caused civilian casualties since the first day of the full-scale Russian invasion in February 2022. The cluster munition attacks began in Vuhledar, followed by subsequent attacks in Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv, Kherson, and other cities. The Russian cluster munition attack on the crowded Kramatorsk train station on April 8, 2022, remains one of the single deadliest incidents for civilians during the war.

The Ukrainian military has also used cluster munitions, including in the Izium area during 2022 that resulted in numerous deaths and serious injuries to civilians, Human Rights Watch said.

Four rounds of US transfers of cluster munitions to Ukraine since 2023 prompted the convention’s member countries, US lawmakers, and civil society groups to criticize the US actions. The US announced a fifth round on April 24. The US is also not a party to the cluster munitions convention.

In September 2023, the convention’s member countries condemned “any use of cluster munitions by any actor” and expressed “grave concern at the significant increase in civilian casualties and the humanitarian impact resulting from the repeated and well documented use of cluster munitions since 2021,” particularly in Ukraine.

Russia, Ukraine, and the US should each make a commitment that they will not further endanger civilian lives in indiscriminate attacks by joining the Convention on Cluster Munitions and destroying their stockpiles, clearing areas contaminated by cluster munition remnants, and assisting victims of the weapons. No country should transfer cluster munitions given the international norm prohibiting any transfer of these weapons.

Russia and Ukraine should promptly compensate victims and their families for loss of life and limb, or access to use of land.

“The deaths and injuries to civilians in Odesa from cluster munitions sadly won’t be the last time civilians are harmed by these weapons,” Wille said. “Concerted international pressure is needed not only to end cluster munition use in Ukraine but throughout the world.”",VERY HIGH,20240529T043000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Belkis Wille, Andriy Kostin, Dmytro Pletenchyk, Denys Sebov",Russia,"Odesa, Ukraine","Countries should join the convention, stop using cluster munitions, and support victims.",Use of cluster munitions resulting in civilian casualties,Ukraine,Ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine

(Berlin, May 30, 2024) – Increasing numbers of people in Uzbekistan are being prosecuted and imprisoned for “insulting the president online,” Human Rights Watch said today. The criminal charge carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and violates international human rights law.

“People in Uzbekistan should be able to criticize the president and other authorities openly, without fear of reprisal,” said Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The government should urgently repeal the offense of ‘insulting the president online’ and take immediate steps to release anyone imprisoned on this charge.”

Uzbek authorities should stop prosecuting citizens who have criticized President Shavkat Mirziyoyev and his family and repeal the law that makes it an offense.

Human Rights Watch reviewed one indictment and five verdicts handed down to people in Uzbekistan in the last year on the charge of “public insult or slander against the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, as well as using the press or other media, telecommunications networks, or the Internet,” under article 158, part 3 of the Uzbek Criminal Code, and found that authorities in Uzbekistan are wrongfully prosecuting citizens for nonviolent exercise of their right to freedom of expression.Other reports indicate even higher numbers of prosecutions on this charge.

Otkirbek Sobirov, 27, expressed his frustration on social media in January 2023 with interruptions to the supply of gas and electricity in the city of Kokand. On May 16, 2023, a Fergana court sentenced Sobirov to two years and three months in prison on charges of “insulting the president online,” “attempting to overthrow the Constitutional order of Uzbekistan,” and “mass riots” under articles 158, part 3; 159, part 1; and 244, part 2b of the criminal code.

The verdict says that Sobirov, who admitted he was frustrated about the gas and electricity cuts during the winter months, sent multiple messages in a Telegram group in which he criticized state policies and called on the president to resign. He also called for a rally against gas and electricity shortages in Kokand.

A state-ordered linguistic analysis concluded that Sobirov’s messages contained calls and ideas aimed at overthrowing legitimate representatives of the authorities, as well as signs of a call for riots that threaten public peace.

On October 26, 2023, the Kattakurgan district court convicted Dilshod Iskandarov, 19, of “insulting the president online” and sentenced him to two-and-a-half years in a penal colony. A state-ordered expert analysis concluded that a single comment Iskandarov made on Instagram, in which he cursed the president’s family under a video of the family, was “insulting and discrediting.”

The verdict notes that sometime after he wrote the comment he deleted it, and that he voluntarily returned to Uzbekistan from Russia after he learned a criminal case had been opened against him.

On March 28, 2024, the Namangan city court sentenced D. Tursunov, 27, to five years in prison for “insulting the president online.” According to the verdict, Tursunov, using the Facebook profile “Muhammad Sanjar,” commented about the Uzbek president attending Moscow’s Victory Day parade, saying: “The traitor went [to Russia] to get a white blessing for [his] lifetime rule.”

The prosecution alleged that Tursunov also insulted President Mirziyoyev, saying: “Even if a donkey circumambulates the Kaaba not twice, but a hundred times, he remains a donkey!” Tursunov was additionally found guilty of illegal border crossing because he did not possess an exit visa when he left Uzbekistan in September 2016. According to media reports, Tursunov returned to Uzbekistan in December 2023 and was arrested upon his return. Uzbekistan stopped requiring exit visas for citizens traveling abroad in 2019.

Sitora Bazarova, 24, was sentenced in early 2024 to five years and two months in prison by a Termez court on multiple criminal charges, including “insulting the president online.” According to the indictment, in May 2022, Bazarova posted on her Facebook page a video of two pictures that were set on fire, one of President Mirziyoyev, with the words “cuckold, let your family burn” written across it, and another of Saida Mirziyoyeva, the president’s daughter, who serves as his first assistant, with the word “slut” written across it.

A court in the Samarkand region sentenced Bunyodjon Boboniyazov, 39, to five years and one month on October 19, 2023, with a state-ordered linguistic analysis of comments he had made on Facebook as evidence that Boboniyazov attempted to overthrow the constitutional order and insulted the Uzbek president online.

Sobir Normamatov, 28, from the Samarkand region, was sentenced to two years and six months of corrective labor on April 8, 2024, for comments, including obscenities, he posted under three videos of President Mirziyoyev and one of Saida Mirziyoyeva on Instagram. In the comments, Normamatov referred to President Mirziyoyev as “a clown” and “duplicitous.”

Human Rights Watch has also seen the ruling of an appeals court in the case of a 40-year-old man in Kashkadarya who was sentenced to four years and six months in prison in February 2022 on charges of “insulting the president online” and “insult.” The ruling does not specify what speech served as the basis of the man’s conviction. Also in February 2022, the blogger Sobirjon Babaniyazov was sentenced to three years in prison under article 158 of the criminal code for videos and audio messages on Telegram that allegedly insulted the president.

Laws that penalize criticism of public figures are contrary to international law and the fact that some forms of expression are considered insulting is not sufficient to justify criminal prosecutions, far less imprisonment, Human Rights Watch said. The offense of “insult” against the president or other officials simply turns the criminal justice system into a tool of the government to take revenge against anyone who offends or slights it.

The United Nations Human Rights Committee, the independent expert body that monitors compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), states in its general comment on freedom of expression that “imprisonment is never an appropriate penalty” for defamation and that “all public figures … are legitimately subject to criticism.”

In 2020, President Mirziyoyev pledged to decriminalize defamation but has yet to do so. Instead, in March 2021, Uzbekistan introduced a new provision making insulting the president online—an even broader offense than defamation—a criminal offense.

The first known prosecution on this charge was of Valijon Kalonov, a blogger and government critic, who, in the lead up to the 2021 presidential elections, criticized the president and called for a boycott of the election. In December 2021, a Jizzakh court ruled that Kalonov could not be held criminally liable and sent him for compulsory psychiatric treatment.

For the last two-and-a-half years, Kalonov has been forcibly held in psychiatric detention, with authorities refusing to discharge him, a grave violation of his rights to liberty and security, health, bodily integrity, and freedom from inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The authorities should immediately release him, Human Rights Watch said.

“These ‘insulting the president’ cases make a mockery of President Mirziyoyev’s reform pledges, demonstrating instead a willingness to resort to tactics used by his strong-arm predecessor, Islam Karimov, to crack down on dissent and muzzle critical voices,” Williamson said. “The practice of locking people up on criminal insult charges has absolutely no place in a rights-respecting country.”",HIGH,20240530T050000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Shavkat Mirziyoyev, Otkirbek Sobirov, Dilshod Iskandarov, D.

(Jerusalem, May 14, 2024) – Israeli forces have carried out at least eight strikes on aid workers’ convoys and premises in Gaza since October 2023, even though aid groups had provided their coordinates to the Israeli authorities to ensure their protection, Human Rights Watch said today. Israeli authorities did not issue advance warnings to any of the aid organizations before the strikes, which killed or injured at least 31 aid workers and those with them. More than 250 aid workers have been killed in Gaza since the October 7 assault in Israel, according to the UN.

One attack on January 18, 2024, injured three people who were staying in a joint guest house belonging to two aid organizations and was most likely carried out with a US-made munition, according to one of the organizations and to a report by UN investigators who visited the site after the attack, which Human Rights Watch reviewed. One of the aid organizations, Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP), said UN inspectors concluded that the bomb was delivered by an F-16 aircraft. F-16 aircraft use British made components according to campaigners.

The eight incidents reveal fundamental flaws with the so-called deconfliction system, meant to protect aid workers and allow them to safely deliver life-saving humanitarian assistance in Gaza.

“Israel’s killing of seven World Central Kitchen aid workers was shocking and should never have happened under international law,” said Belkis Wille, associate crisis, conflict, and arms director at Human Rights Watch. “Israel’s allies need to recognize that these attacks that have killed aid workers have happened over and over again, and they need to stop.”

Israel’s attack on April 1 on the World Central Kitchen convoy, which killed seven workers, far from being an isolated “mistake,” is just one of at least eight incidents that Human Rights Watch identified in which aid organizations and UN agencies had communicated with Israeli authorities the GPS coordinates of an aid convoy or premises and yet Israeli forces attacked the convoy or shelter without any warning.

In these eight incidents, Israeli forces killed at least 15 people, including 2 children, and injured at least 16 others. Five of these attacks were the subject of a recent New York Times investigation that included visual evidence and internal communications between aid organizations and the Israeli military.

The other seven attacks are:

Attack on a Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF or Doctors without Borders) convoy, November 18, 2023

Attack on a guest house of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), December 9, 2023

Attack on an MSF guest house, February 20, 2024

Attack on a home sheltering an American Near East Refugee Aid Organization (Anera) employee, March 8, 2024

As of April 30, the UN reported that 254 aid workers had been killed in Gaza since October 7, 2023, with UNRWA personnel accounting for 188 of these fatalities. On May 13, a UN vehicle was hit on the way to a hospital in Gaza, killing at least one UN staff member and injuring at least one more. According to UNRWA, 169 of its facilities have been affected by the hostilities in 368 incidents and at least 429 displaced people have been killed in UNRWA shelters. Israeli forces have, according to the UN, also shot at and shelled people congregating to collect aid, killing and injuring hundreds. These attacks are having a chilling effect on efforts to provide lifesaving aid in Gaza.

Aid workers have also been unable to leave Gaza, since Israeli forces seized control of and closed the Rafah Crossing on May 7.

During a recent trip to Cairo and northern Sinai, near the border between Egypt and Gaza, Human Rights Watch met with staff from 11 humanitarian organizations and UN aid agencies operating in Gaza who said that Israeli attacks on aid workers had forced them to take various measures that for some included suspending activities for a period of time, reducing their staff inside Gaza, or severely restricting their aid activities in other ways.

“I can’t risk sending more staff into Gaza because I cannot rely on deconfliction as a way of keeping them safe,” a senior employee from one of the organizations whose guest house was attacked told Human Rights Watch. He said this was a key factor in limiting the organization’s ability to provide medical services. “You can build docks and send shipments, but without a safe operating environment, you will have a pile up of shipments that people aren’t able to deploy safely to help people.”

This pattern of attacks despite proper notification of Israeli authorities raises serious questions about Israel’s commitment and capacity to comply with international humanitarian law, which some countries, including the UK, rely on to continue to license arms exports that end up in Israel.

Human Rights Watch has found that Israeli authorities are using starvation as a method of warfare in Gaza. Pursuant to a policy set out by Israeli officials and carried out by Israeli forces, the Israeli authorities are deliberately blocking the delivery of water, food, and fuel, willfully impeding humanitarian assistance, apparently razing agricultural areas, and depriving the civilian population of objects indispensable to its survival. Children in Gaza have been dying from starvation-related complications.

Israel has not responded to a Human Rights Watch letter sent on May 1, requesting specific information about the attacks on aid workers documented in this report.

The laws of war prohibit attacks that target civilians and civilian objects, that do not discriminate between civilians and combatants, or that are expected to cause harm to civilians or civilian objects that is disproportionate to any anticipated military advantage. Indiscriminate attacks include attacks that are not directed at a specific military target or use a method or means of combat whose effects cannot be limited as required.

Warring parties must take all feasible precautions to minimize harm to civilians, including by providing effective advance warnings of attacks unless circumstances do not permit, and by sparing civilians under their control from the effects of attacks. Serious violations of the laws of war committed by individuals with criminal intent – that is, deliberately or recklessly – are war crimes.

Israel should make public the findings of investigations into attacks that have killed and injured aid workers, and into all other attacks that caused civilian casualties. The Israeli military’s long track record of failing to credibly investigate alleged war crimes underscores the importance of the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) inquiry into serious crimes committed by all parties to the conflict.

Israeli and Palestinian officials should cooperate with the ICC in their work, Human Rights Watch said. Israel should also provide the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel access to Gaza to conduct its investigations.

Given the pattern of attacks on aid groups that have provided Israeli authorities with proper information about their locations, a group of recognized international experts should conduct an independent review of the humanitarian deconfliction process. Israel should give these experts full access to its processes, including the coordination and communications that occur before, during, and after such attacks as well as information regarding any alleged military target in the vicinity and any precautionary measures taken to mitigate harm.

Israel’s allies, including the United States and United Kingdom – both states sending the weapons parts apparently used in at least one of the documented attacks – should suspend military assistance and arms sales to Israel so long as its forces commit systematic and widespread laws-of-war violations against Palestinian civilians with impunity. Governments that continue to provide arms to the Israeli government risk complicity in war crimes.

They should also use their leverage, including through targeted sanctions, to press Israeli authorities to cease committing grave abuses and enable the provision of humanitarian aid and basic services in Gaza, in accordance with Israel’s obligations under international law and recent International Court of Justice (ICJ) orders to Israel in the case brought by South Africa concerning alleged violations of the Genocide Convention.

“On one hand, Israel is blocking access to critical lifesaving humanitarian provisions and on the other, attacking convoys that are delivering some of the small amount that they are allowing in,” Wille said. “Israeli forces should immediately end their attacks on aid organizations, and there should be accountability for these crimes.”

Attack on the World Central Kitchen Workers

On April 1, just before 11 p.m., Israeli forces carried out a drone strike with three missiles targeting a convoy of three World Central Kitchen (WCK) vehicles, two marked with the organization’s logo on the roof, in central Gaza, all carrying civilians, that were escorting eight aid trucks. The attack killed seven aid workers. The convoy had just left a food warehouse in Deir al-Balah and was traveling a route that the organization said they had agreed upon with the Israeli military. The attack was reportedly carried out by an Israeli-made Hermes 450 drone.

After the attack, WCK paused its operations in Gaza for several weeks, as did American Near East Refugee Aid (Anera). At the time, the two groups had together been providing an average of 300,000 meals across Gaza daily. Photographs of the damaged vehicles were initially verified by the independent investigative collective Bellingcat and later independently verified by Human Rights Watch researchers.

A preliminary Israeli investigation into the attack found that Israeli forces’ conduct was “contrary to the Standard Operating Procedures” and had occurred because of “a grave mistake,” including a lack of coordination between different levels of the army and the mistaken identity of a man in one of the vehicles, according to the Israeli armed forces. The preliminary investigation also found that the two additional drone missiles were fired against army protocol.

In its response, WCK reiterated its call for an independent commission to investigate the incident because, it said, the “[Israeli Defense Forces] cannot credibly investigate its own failure in Gaza.” WCK resumed its operations in late April because, it said, “The humanitarian situation in Gaza remains dire,” but said it had still received “no concrete assurances” that the Israeli military’s operational procedures had changed.

This incident elicited widespread condemnation, including from leaders of countries whose citizens were killed in the attack, including United States President Joe Biden, United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Attack on a Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) Convoy, November 18

On November 18, 2023, armed forces attacked a convoy of five marked MSF vehicles, killing two people, witnesses said. The group had been trying to evacuate 137 civilians from its guesthouse near al-Shifa Hospital in Rimal, northern Gaza, where they had been trapped for a week, to southern Gaza. MSF said that it had coordinated the convoy’s movement with the Israeli armed forces and followed the route prescribed by the army. Once the convoy reached a crowded checkpoint near Wadi Gaza, Israeli soldiers did not allow the vehicles to clear the checkpoint for hours.

When gunfire rang out near the checkpoint, MSF staff, who were still waiting to go through the checkpoint, decided to return to the guest house, 7.5 kilometers to the north. They said they maintained contact with the Israeli Coordination and Liaison Administration (CLA), the military unit responsible for the coordination of access to and from Gaza in connection with the facilitation of civilian and humanitarian needs, throughout their travel back and informed them that the convoy had to return to their guest house.

As they were approaching their office, between 3:30 and 4 p.m., MSF said that the Israeli army attacked the convoy, hitting two of the vehicles. The organization quoted one staff member as saying: “I was terrified when I saw that the snipers and the tanks were pointing their weapons at us, especially at the fourth and the fifth van [in the convoy].” MSF said that the staff there during the incident saw no military targets in the area. The organization has requested an explanation from Israeli authorities, but has received no response, a representative told Human Rights Watch.

“This incident shows just how ineffective the coordination mechanisms put in place by Israeli authorities have been,” said the representative of MSF. In this instance, “The latter appeared to have little or no influence on the operational troops on the ground, including to let the vehicles pass through the checkpoint.”

This failed coordination with the CLA has been cited in previous UN reporting.

Attack on a Guest House of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), December 9

On December 9, the Israeli navy fired 20mm cannon rounds at an UNRWA guest house consisting of two buildings in Rafah, Gaza’s southernmost governorate, the agency told Human Rights Watch. The rounds damaged the west side of both buildings. The attack occurred late in the evening, while 10 staff were asleep inside. The agency said it had shared the coordinates of the guest house with Israeli authorities on a regular basis prior to the attack, including on the date of the attack, and was not aware of any military targets in the area at the time. UNRWA told Human Rights Watch that it had received no warning of the attack. Following the attack, the deputy commander of the Israeli Southern Command told UNRWA that the attack had been carried out in error, UNRWA told Human Rights Watch.

Attack on an MSF Shelter, January 8

On January 8, an Israeli projectile pierced the side of a building in which over 100 MSF staff and their families were sheltering in Khan Yunis, MSF said. The strike killed the 5-year-old daughter of an MSF worker and injured four people. At the time, the staff saw no military targets in the area and received no warning of the attack, which took place in an area under no evacuation order, the organization told Human Rights Watch. The organization said it had shared the coordinates of the building with Israeli authorities on a regular basis, saying it was being used as an MSF shelter.

MSF published a video in which Léo Cans, the MSF head of mission for Palestine, described the attack and showed two parallel holes in the wall that munitions had passed through, he said. The video also included two photographs of remnants lying on the grass, allegedly outside the building. Human Rights Watch could not confirm the location of these remnants but was not able to find them online prior to January 8. The New York Times analyzed the photographs and reported that they showed the remnants of an Israeli 120mm tank shell with Hebrew markings outside the shelter. Human Rights Watch independently verified the type of remnants.

The Israeli military denied to the New York Times that it had struck the building. However, MSF said that Israeli authorities later told the organization that the damage to the guest house had been collateral in an attack on a “terror” target.

Attack on an International Rescue Committee (IRC) and Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) Guest House, January 18

On January 18, an Israeli air attack hit the perimeter wall around a guest house being used by both the IRC and MAP north of Khan Younis, where 12 people, including 4 doctors, were staying at the time, according to the 2 organizations. No one was killed in the strike but three people suffered light injuries, MAP told Human Rights Watch.

Satellite analysis shows the attack left a roughly 15-meter-wide crater in the sandy ground, destroyed the wall marking the perimeter of the property, and significantly damaged the house. MAP confirmed to Human Rights Watch that the organization had shared the coordinates of the guest house with the Israeli authorities and with the UN twice in late 2023 to ensure it did not come under attack. The building stands alone, with no other buildings or structures around it, and MAP said they knew of no military targets in the area at the time of the attack and received no warnings.

Human Rights Watch reviewed a report of an on-site independent assessment by a multi-agency UN team after the attack, which concluded that the damage was the result of an airstrike, most likely involving a US-made guided GBU-32 air-dropped bomb. MAP said inspectors concluded that the bomb was delivered by an F-16 aircraft. The organizations said that, since the attack, Israel has provided six different and often contradictory explanations as to whether and why the attack took place, but they said the explanations had not provided clarity or accountability.

Attack on an UNRWA Convoy, February 5

On February 5, Israeli naval gunfire hit an UNRWA aid truck, the agency said. The attack occurred while a convoy of 10 trucks flanked by marked UN vehicles were parked on a road in western Nuseirat, waiting at a previously agreed holding point for permission from the Israeli military to proceed to an Israeli checkpoint. The shelling damaged the last truck in the convoy. No one was injured. UNRWA said it had coordinated with Israeli authorities the planned movement of trucks prior to the attack, including reporting to Israeli authorities when the convoy had reached the holding point and when aid workers in the convoy began to hear naval gunfire in proximity to the stationary convoy.

Because of this incident, UNRWA and its partners had to pause assistance activities to northern Gaza, affecting 200,000 people, for 19 days, a UNRWA representative said. Since March 24, the Israeli government has restricted access to northern Gaza for UNRWA , refusing to allow UNRWA to provide food assistance to the north, despite UNRWA’s mandate. Israeli authorities have taken other steps that have undermined the ability of UNRWA to distribute aid in Gaza, which has contributed to the dire humanitarian situation, given that UNRWA has maintained the largest humanitarian aid operation in Gaza.

The Israeli military told CNN the same day that it was looking into the incident. An UNRWA official told Human Rights Watch that Israeli authorities have since acknowledged the attack and said they have put in place “prevention measures to prevent another such occurrence.”

Attack on an MSF Guest House, February 20

Just after 8 p.m. on February 20, an Israeli tank fired a medium- to large-caliber weapon at a multi-story apartment building in al-Mawasi neighborhood of Khan Younis housing only MSF staff and their families, 64 people in all. The attack killed two people and injured seven others. MSF said that the weapon was an Israeli tank shell. It said that staff saw no military objects in the area at the time and received no warning.

Photographs and videos included in a Sky News report on the attack and reviewed by Human Rights Watch confirm that a large MSF flag was draped on the outside of the building at the time of the attack. The images and satellite imagery also show that the building is secluded, with the nearest buildings approximately 50 meters away.

MSF said that armed forces fired additional rounds at the building’s exterior and the interior of the ground floor. It told Human Rights Watch that an independent investigation, which was corroborated by witness accounts, confirmed that there had been an Israeli tank in the area at the time of the incident. The investigation found that the projectile causing the explosion was fired by an Israeli Merkava tank. The small-caliber bullet impacts on the building are consistent with the secondary armament of Merkava tanks, it also concluded. Human Rights Watch verified a photograph posted on X (formerly known as Twitter) by MSF on February 22, showing damage to the exterior of the building.

MSF said that the organization had shared the coordinates of the building with the Israeli authorities prior to the attack. It received no warning. MSF said that, after the attack, Israeli authorities reconfirmed that they had received the coordinates of the building.

In response to the attack, the Israeli army told Sky News the tank opened fire on the building because it had been “identified as a building where terror activity is occurring.” It committed to an examination by the Israeli Army's General Staff's Fact Finding and Assessment Mechanism, a permanent “independent” body established in 2014 to examine “exceptional incidents” that take place during military operations. No results have been made public.

“These killings underscore the grim reality that nowhere in Gaza is safe, that promises of safe areas are empty and deconfliction mechanisms unreliable,” Meinie Nicolai, MSF general director, told Sky News after the incident.

Attack on a Home Sheltering an American Near East Refugee Aid (Anera) Employee, March 8

On October 13, Doaa Shawwa, her husband Mousa Shawwa, and their children Dima, 13, and Karim, 6, fled their home in Tal al-Hawa and moved into the second-floor apartment of a friend in al-Zuwaida, in a building with three apartments further south. The attack killed at least three people and injured at least three more. Doaa told Human Rights Watch the neighborhood had avoided the worst of the hostilities over the subsequent months. Mousa was the Anera supply and logistics coordinator, and, upon moving to al-Zuwaida, he had communicated the coordinates of the home with his Anera colleagues, the organization confirmed.

Anera showed the New York Times emails it had sent to Israeli authorities in which it included the coordinates of the house, as well as photographs of the building, informing them that this was where one of their workers was living with his family. In the emails, Israeli authorities confirmed that the location was being “processed” in their “system.”

On Friday, March 8, at about 4 p.m., an Israeli strike hit the building without warning, Doaa said. Mousa was standing in the doorway of the apartment with Doaa’s visiting brother, Baha al-Gifri, speaking to Doaa when the strike hit. “He was halfway through his sentence when we were hit. I don’t remember anything from that moment, I lost consciousness immediately and only woke up later in the hospital to find out that I had lost Mousa and my brother,” she said.

Mousa had injuries all over his body and died as he arrived at al-Aqsa Hospital, Doaa said she was later told. Baha died at the moment of impact, with wounds to his head and face. Doaa’s 6-year-old son, Karim, had a head injury, but medical staff did not realize he had a skull fracture and internal bleeding in his brain, so his injuries went initially untreated. He died at al-Arish Hospital in Egypt, 11 days after the attack.

With the assistance of Anera, Doaa, Karim, and Dima had been transferred to Egypt from Gaza eight days after the attack. The attack fractured Doaa’s right hand and caused a large wound to her face and head. It fractured Dima’s right foot, and covered her body and face with wounds from metal fragments. Dima also had burns on her right hand. A friend who owned the home in Gaza where they were attacked also had burns on his face, Doaa said.

Doaa said that, as far as she knew, the other two apartments in their building had only been housing civilians, and that she knew of no presence of armed forces in the neighborhood. Human Rights Watch verified Al Jazeera footage, posted on YouTube on March 9, of the building after the attack which shows considerable damage to the second floor of the building, and experts consulted by the New York Times concluded the attack was carried out with a precision-guided air-dropped munition. Israel told the New York Times in response to its request for comment that the attack had targeted a Hamas member who participated in the October 7 assault in Israel. Anera said it had received no information from Israel about who or what had been targeted, or why.

“We did not receive any warning from the Israelis before the attack,” Doaa said. “This is the thing that upsets me the most. My husband works for an American organization and the Israelis knew we were there. They should have sent us a message to warn us to get out. Why didn’t they?” Doaa said she keeps asking herself. “This was something beyond our imagination.

(Johannesburg) – An armed group linked to the Islamic State (ISIS) in northern Mozambique used boys as young as 13 to raid and loot the town of Macomia, in Cabo Delgado province, on May 10, 2024, Human Rights Watch said today. It is unclear if the children also engaged in fighting against government armed forces. The recruitment and use of children under age 15 as child soldiers is a war crime.

The armed group, known locally as Al-Shabab, attacked Macomia to loot shops and warehouses before targeting government forces’ positions in the town, triggering heavy fighting. Several witnesses, including relatives of the boys, told Human Rights Watch that among the Al-Shabab fighters who took part in the raid were dozens of boys carrying ammunition belts and AK-style assault rifles. Two people from the same family said they recognized their 13-year-old nephew among the children.

“The armed group Al-Shabab’s use of children as soldiers is cruel, unlawful, and only adds to the horrors of Cabo Delgado’s conflict,” said Zenaida Machado, senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Al-Shabab should immediately release all children in their ranks and stop any further recruitment.”

Human Rights Watch spoke by phone with six residents who witnessed the Macomia raid, as well as two humanitarian aid workers in the region. They said that the fighters, including dozens of boys, arrived in the town at around 4 a.m. on May 10. They were divided into at least three groups of “hundreds,” witnesses said. One group wandered around the town, speaking to residents and looting shops and warehouses.

Footage seen by Human Rights Watch, and now widely shared on social media, appeared to show some of the fighters, including a child, carrying guns and freely moving near a local market. According to witnesses and media reports, a second group engaged in fighting against joint South African and Mozambican army troops stationed in the town, while a third group blocked the main road to Macomia, where they reportedly ambushed military vehicles carrying South African troops serving with the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Mission in Mozambique (SAMIM).

President Filipe Nyusi confirmed the raid, which took place in an area that the Southern African military mission previously controlled. The military mission is gradually withdrawing from the country ahead of a July deadline.

More than 700 people fled the fighting that started on May 10 and continued through May 12, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Some of the displaced sought to hide in the surrounding forests according to press reports and footage shared online. At least 10 people, mostly soldiers, were reportedly killed in the fighting.

One of the people who hid in surrounding forests was the 22-year-old trader, Abu Rachide. He told Human Rights Watch that upon arrival in the town, fighters engaged peacefully with people and told residents not to fear or flee as they had “come only for the food.” He said: “I and my sister decided to flee anyway because we didn’t want to take risks, but many people stayed behind.”

Abu Rachide said that he saw dozens of children among the fighters, including his 13-year-old nephew who had been missing since a January 10 attack in Mucojo. “I saw him with my own eyes carrying a big gun and ammunition belt and acting like a confident big man,” Abu Rachide said. When he called out to his nephew, Abu Rachide said, the boy waved at him and then continued on his mission.

Abu Rachide’s sister, Aida, confirmed his account. “The boy seemed very comfortable carrying a gun and taking instructions from the [older ones],” she said. “I kept wondering how he became a fighter like that in just four months.”

A 47-year-old trader, Jamal Jorge, who decided to stay in the market to monitor events, said most of the fighters were children and young men who spoke Swahili and Kimwani, a language spoken on the coast of Cabo Delgado. He said he saw more than 20 children among the fighters. “There in the market, I only saw children, some a bit older, maybe 17 or 20 years,” he said. “But to me, most of them were children not older than 16 years.”

Al-Shabab fighters occupied Macomia town for more than 24 hours, abandoning the area on the afternoon of May 11, then moving toward Mucojo, various sources said. Before departing the town, they looted food from various shops and warehouses of humanitarian groups, two humanitarian workers said. Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors without Borders or MSF) said it had suspended its activities in Macomia following the violence.

Mozambique’s Al-Shabab have long used children in combat. In 2021, Human Rights Watch reported that the group was kidnapping boys and using them to fight government forces in violation of the international prohibition on the use of child soldiers.

The United Nations Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict, which Mozambique ratified in 2004, prohibits non-state armed groups from recruiting children under 18. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court categorizes as a war crime the conscription, enlistment, or active use of children under age 15 in active hostilities during armed conflict. The African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child further notes that non-state armed groups are bound by international humanitarian law.

“Al-Shabab’s ability to recruit, train and use child soldiers across Cabo Delgado is very concerning,” Machado said. “The Mozambican authorities, armed groups, and international partners should step up their efforts to ensure that children stay safe in school and at home and keep children off the battlefield.”",VERY HIGH,20240515T084500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Zenaida Machado, Abu Rachide, Aida, Jamal Jorge",Al-Shabab,"Macomia, Cabo Delgado province, Mozambique","Immediate release of children by Al-Shabab, efforts to keep children safe in schools and homes.",Use of child soldiers,Mozambique,"Ongoing conflict in Cabo Delgado, recruitment strategies of armed groups"

In April 2016, Vietnam experienced one of the worst environmental disasters in its history when Formosa Ha Tinh Steel, a subsidiary of the Taiwan-based Formosa Plastics Group, discharged toxic chemical waste off the coast of Ha Tinh province, killing millions of fish and destroying the livelihoods of fishing communities.

Afterwards, Formosa admitted responsibility for the disaster and pledged US$500 million in compensation—not to the victims but to the Vietnamese government. Residents of affected provinces have complained about the lack of transparency in the payment of the compensation, including obstacles to claiming damages and misappropriation of funds by local authorities.

Vietnamese authorities have also repressed protests over the disaster. Shortly after the spill, thousands of people carrying homemade banners calling for “clean water, clean government, and transparency” demonstrated peacefully to demand an investigation. Police and other security forces used unnecessary and excessive force against the marchers, assaulting people and arresting them. In the years since, the government has continued to silence critics. At least 41 activists involved in protests were sentenced to many years in prison. Of this group, 31 are still behind bars.

The prominent blogger Pham Doan Trang is currently serving a nine-year prison sentence after being charged with “conducting propaganda against the state.” One of the documents the authorities cited in her conviction was her report on the Formosa toxic chemical spill.

Labor activist Hoang Duc Binh is serving a 14-year prison sentence. He had participated in protests and helped organize advocacy around compensation for fishermen who lost their livelihoods.

Nguyen Nam Phong was arrested after driving people to an event where hundreds of people were gathering to file court petitions against Formosa. Many of the protesters were reportedly arrested or assaulted.

Facing the impossibility of pursuing justice in Vietnam, some victims of the spill took their case to Taiwan in 2019. Taiwan’s Supreme Court eventually determined that the plaintiffs needed to have their court documents notarized at Taiwan’s mission in Vietnam. But because the Vietnamese government continues to retaliate against victims and advocates, that has proved nearly insurmountable as well.

Given the extraordinary situation in Vietnam, Taiwan’s courts should consider other methods of notarization and extend the deadline for submission, which is currently the end of this week. The courts should not compound injustice by accommodating Vietnamese government repression.",VERY HIGH,20240514T233000Z,Vietnamese fishing communities and activists,"Pham Doan Trang, Hoang Duc Binh, Nguyen Nam Phong",Formosa Ha Tinh Steel and Vietnamese government,"Coast of Ha Tinh province, Vietnam",Consider alternative notarization methods for victims in Taiwan; extend submission deadlines.,Environmental disaster and repression of protests,Vietnam,"Industrial pollution, lack of accountability, governmental repression"

Thai anti-monarchy activist Netiporn “Bung” Sanesangkhom, 28, died in custody in Bangkok today while on a hunger strike she began in January.

Netiporn brought attention to Thailand’s cruel use of its lese majeste (insulting the monarchy) law, which punishes critics of the monarchy with up to 15 years in prison. Thai authorities had paused lese majeste prosecutions for nearly three years until November 2020, when then-Prime Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-ocha ordered prosecutions resumed, purportedly due to growing criticism of the monarchy.

Authorities have jailed thousands under this law in recent years, and hundreds have been sentenced to lengthy prison terms. Hundreds of people accused of criticizing the monarchy are currently in pretrial detention without access to bail.

Thailand’s current prime minister, Srettha Tavisin, has vowed to continue strict enforcement of the lese majeste law. The Constitutional Court in January ruled that attempts by the opposition Move Forward Party to amend the law would amount to treason, which could result in the party’s dissolution and a ban on its leaders from politics.

Netiporn was one of about 270 activists charged with lese majeste after pro-democracy demonstrations broke out in Thailand in 2020. Her alleged crimes were related to a peaceful campaign to survey inconveniences to the Thai public from royal motorcades.

Human Rights Watch and several United Nations human rights experts, including the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, have repeatedly voiced concern over the Thai government’s use of arbitrary arrest and pretrial detention to punish critics of the monarchy.

Netiporn began her hunger strike to demand the right to bail for detainees like herself and to protest such prosecutions in general. Authorities met her demands with silence and have shown no interest in reforming the law or leniency for critics.

Prime Minister Srettha has now been in office 10 months, saying he would strengthen the rule of law and make Thailand a more rights-respecting country. But repressive government prosecutions remain the norm, reminiscent of when Thailand was under military rule.

Netiporn’s death should be a catalyst for Thai government reform. Authorities should engage with UN experts and civil society groups to amend the lese majeste law and bring it into compliance with human rights standards.

Thai authorities are helping neighboring governments to take unlawful actions against refugees and dissidents from abroad, making Thailand increasingly unsafe for those fleeing persecution.

These targets of transnational repression have gotten caught up in a “swap mart” in which foreign dissidents are effectively traded for critics of the Thai government living abroad.

The Thai government should investigate alleged harassment, threats, surveillance, and forced returns against migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers, and the role of Thai officials in these actions.

(Bangkok) – Thai authorities are assisting neighboring governments to take unlawful actions against refugees and dissidents from abroad, making Thailand increasingly unsafe for those fleeing persecution, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. These targets of transnational repression have gotten caught up in a “swap mart” in which foreign dissidents in Thailand are effectively traded for critics of the Thai government living abroad.

The report, “‘We Thought We Were Safe’: Repression and Refoulement of Refugees in Thailand,” details Thai authorities’ upsurge in repression directed at foreign nationals seeking refugee protection in Thailand. Foreign governments have subjected exiled dissidents and activists living in Thailand to harassment, surveillance, and physical violence, often with the cooperation and knowledge of Thai authorities. In a number of cases, Thai officials arrested asylum seekers and refugees and deported them without due process to their home countries.

“Thai authorities have increasing engaged in a ‘swap mart’ with neighboring governments to unlawfully exchange each other’s dissidents,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin should break with this practice and prosecute Thai officials wrongfully collaborating with foreign governments acting on Thai soil.”

The term “transnational repression” describes efforts by governments or their agents to silence or deter dissent by committing human rights abuses against their own nationals or members of the country’s diaspora outside their territorial jurisdiction.

Human Rights Watch analyzed 25 cases that took place in Thailand between 2014 and 2023 and conducted 18 interviews with victims, their family members, and witnesses to abuses, along with representatives of local and international nongovernmental organizations. The governments responsible include member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as well as China and Bahrain, among others.

In one case, a Cambodian dissident who had fled to Thailand in July 2022, said he started receiving letters from Cambodian officials urging him to defect from the main Cambodian opposition party. After he had received these letters for months, unidentified men attacked him in August 2023. “They did not say anything to me, they just came out and started beating me,” the Cambodian dissident said.

In recent years in Thailand, dissidents from Vietnam have been tracked down and abducted, Lao democracy advocates have been forcibly disappeared or killed, and a Malaysian LGBTI rights influencer was targeted for repatriation. Thai authorities have detained and unlawfully deported Chinese dissidents and refugees, seemingly at the request of the Chinese government. Thai authorities also detained a visiting professional football player from Bahrain with Australian refugee status, and nearly returned him to Bahrain.

At the same time, a number of Thai activists have been killed or disappeared in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. The mutilated bodies of two missing activists were later found floating in the Mekong River.

“Swap mart” arrangements increased under Thailand’s National Council for Peace and Order military government that came to power after the May 2014 coup and continued under the post-2019 government of Prime Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-ocha.

The Thai authorities, in addition to facilitating assaults, abductions, enforced disappearances, and other abuses, repeatedly violated the principle of nonrefoulement: the prohibition on returning anyone to a place where they would face a real risk of persecution, torture, or other serious ill-treatment, or a threat to life.

Thai authorities have arrested and summarily deported exiled critics and dissidents, even those with refugee status determined by the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR). One Cambodian activist pleaded with Thai police, saying he would “be killed or put in jail … if deported.” Yet Thai authorities forcibly returned him to Cambodia within days of his arrest.

Thailand’s actions violate customary international law as well as the UN Convention against Torture and other treaties that Thailand has ratified barring refoulement. The actions also violate Thailand’s Act on Prevention and Suppression of Torture and Enforced Disappearances, which came into effect in February 2023. It states that “no government organizations or public officials shall expel, deport, or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of torture, cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, or enforced disappearance.”

The Thai government should thoroughly and impartially investigate alleged harassment, threats, surveillance, and forced returns from Thailand by foreign governments against migrants, refugees and asylum seekers in Thailand and the role of Thai officials in those actions, Human Rights Watch said.

“Prime Minister Srettha should act to restore Thailand’s deserved reputation as a country that is a safe haven for dissidents from abroad,” Pearson said. “He should immediately order a full and transparent investigation into arbitrary arrests, violent assaults, and forced returns of refugees and political dissidents.”",VERY HIGH,20240516T034500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Elaine Pearson, Srettha Thavisin",Thai authorities,Thailand,"Investigate and prosecute violations, restore Thailand's reputation as a safe haven for dissidents.",Assisting neighboring governments in unlawful actions against refugees and dissidents,Thailand,"Transnational repression, Political repression from neighboring governments, Military government actions"

(Geneva) – A Swiss court’s conviction of the former Gambian Interior Minister Ousman Sonko for crimes against humanity is monumental for Gambian victims of atrocity crimes during the rule of Yahya Jammeh, Human Rights Watch said today. The verdict is a major achievement for Switzerland’s efforts to hold accountable those responsible for grave crimes committed abroad.

On May 15, 2024, the Swiss Federal Criminal Court in Bellinzona convicted Sonko and sentenced him to 20 years in prison for his role in crimes against humanity relating to torture, illegal detentions, and unlawful killings between 2000 and 2016 during then-President Jammeh’s administration. Sonko is the second person convicted in Europe for international crimes committed in Gambia.

“Ousman Sonko’s conviction is a landmark moment for Gambian victims of brutal crimes under Yahya Jammeh’s rule,” said Balkees Jarrah, associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch. “The verdict should catalyze justice efforts in Gambia and further bolster Swiss prosecutors to continue to pursue international atrocity cases.”

Sonko’s trial was possible because Swiss law recognizes universal jurisdiction over certain serious international crimes, allowing for the prosecution of these crimes no matter where they were committed and regardless of the nationality of the suspects or victims. Sonko is the highest-ranking former government official to be convicted on the continent under the principle of universal jurisdiction, Human Rights Watch said.

Swiss authorities arrested Sonko in Bern on January 26, 2017, the day after a Swiss nongovernmental group, TRIAL International, filed a criminal complaint against him. The Swiss Attorney General’s office filed an indictment against Sonko on April 17, 2023. The prosecution, representatives of victims who were formal parties to the proceeding known under Swiss law as private plaintiffs, and the defense presented arguments during the trial, which opened on January 8 and closed on March 7. A number of witnesses, as well as Sonko himself, testified during the proceedings. TRIAL International provided daily highlights of the hearings.

Over the past two decades, the national courts of an increasing number of countries have pursued cases involving war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, torture, enforced disappearances, and extrajudicial executions committed abroad. Despite having solid legislation to pursue such cases, judicial officials in Switzerland have been criticized in the past for lagging behind other European counterparts. Nevertheless, over the past few years, Swiss authorities have pursued a number of universal jurisdiction cases involving alleged crimes in Liberia, Algeria, and Syria.

Members of the media, civil society representatives, and the general public were able to attend the trial in person. However, remote access to the proceeding was not available, posing problems for victims and affected communities in Gambia to follow the case. The media reported that the Swiss court did not cover the private plaintiffs’ costs to attend the entire trial, only the days they presented evidence in the courtroom, hindering the ability of plaintiffs to attend key hearings, including the delivery of the verdict. Human Rights Watch research in other situations has shown that inadequate outreach to affected communities can undermine the impact of accountability efforts for serious international crimes.

Another concern was whether Gambians could follow and understand the proceedings, which were conducted in German. Human Rights Watch monitored five court sessions and noted that the interpretation provided from German into English, a language understood by the accused and Gambian communities, was not comprehensive. On the final day of the trial, Sonko expressed his concern that crucial steps of the proceeding, such as the parties’ closing arguments, were not accompanied by English interpretation. The court made the conclusions of the judgment available in English. Swiss authorities should ensure that future universal jurisdiction cases are fully accessible to the accused and affected communities, including by providing adequate interpretation, even if not legally required.

Under Jammeh’s 22-year rule, the government carried out systematic oppression against any real or perceived opponents to maintain political power. The government targeted journalists, human rights defenders, student leaders, religious leaders, political opposition members, judiciary officials, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people, and security force personnel, among others. Those apprehended were subjected to torture, extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearance, and sexual violence. Many of these human rights violations were brought to light during the hearings of Gambia’s Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission (TRRC), which was set up in 2018.

Since Jammeh’s fall, Gambia’s government has brought only two prosecutions for Jammeh-era crimes. In December 2021, the final report of the TRRC found that Jammeh and 69 of his associates committed crimes against humanity, and called for their prosecution. In May 2022, the Gambian government accepted the TRRC’s recommendation for accountability.

On April 22, 2024, in a pivotal move toward justice, the Gambian national assembly approved two bills to further the creation of a Special Prosecutor’s Office and a hybrid court with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to try the most serious crimes.

“Victims of Jammeh-era crimes are entitled to justice and Sonko’s conviction is a step closer to that goal,” Jarrah said. “The verdict underscores the importance of the Gambian government and ECOWAS following through swiftly on establishing an impartial and independent hybrid court to widen accountability’s reach in the country.”",HIGH,20240515T131500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Ousman Sonko, Yahya Jammeh, Balkees Jarrah",Ousman Sonko,"Switzerland (trial), Gambia (crimes committed)",Ensure full access and adequate interpretation for affected communities in future trials.,"Crimes against humanity including torture, illegal detentions, and unlawful killings",Gambia,Systematic oppression and political repression under Yahya Jammeh's rule

Two years ago, Tajik authorities cracked down on protesters in an autonomous region of the country, resulting in the death of a local man by what witnesses reported was live ammunition from security forces. In the next couple of days, police reportedly killed up to 40 people from the area during so-called security operations.

These events were a turning point for an already troubled region.

The protests began peacefully on May 16, 2022, in Khorog, the capital of the Gorno-Badakshan autonomous region (GBAO), with people demanding an end to harassment and alleged persecution of local people by Tajik authorities.

Over the next two days, police blocked and dispersed protesters using rubber bullets and teargas, reportedly with excessive force. Police also carried out killings and arbitrarily detained and tortured more than two hundred protesters and local people, who were prosecuted behind closed doors.

There has been no accountability for the crackdown on protesters, which authorities called an “anti-terrorism operation.”

At least six civil society activists who stood up for the rights of the Pamiris, a culturally, religiously, and linguistically distinct ethnic minority living in the region that has been historically persecuted by authorities, are still imprisoned.

They include Ulfatkhonim Mamadshoeva, a 67-year-old independent journalist and civil rights activist sentenced to 21 years in prison on charges of conspiring against the state and organizing the protests, and Manuchehr Kholiqnazarov, director of the Lawyers Association of Pamir, sentenced to 16 years on charges of participation in a criminal organization.

Since the protests, Pamiris have reportedly been prohibited from speaking their languages in public and from hosting prayer meetings in their homes. At a high-level UN meeting, Tajikistan’s justice minister, Muzaffar Ashuriyon, denied that the Pamiris are a distinct ethnic minority. Hundreds of nongovernmental groups in the region and the country have been forced to close.

The international response to the crisis has been relatively muted. In July 2022, the European Parliament and in December 2022, Mary Lawlor, the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, called on the Tajik authorities to investigate the clashes in GBAO. But more is needed.

Despite reports of Tajikistan's increased involvement in transnational repression, there are signs of growing security cooperation between certain EU members and Türkiye with Tajikistan.

(New York) – FIFA should immediately release and commit to implementing the robust Human Rights Framework for the 2026 Men’s Soccer World Cup, which it developed through extensive consultations with civil society stakeholders and public officials from across North America. The framework, which FIFA shared with host cities in March 2024, will govern labor and human rights for all 16 North American host cities.

FIFA should now make the framework public for all stakeholders without any dilution or further delay. FIFA’s continued delay in a public release of the framework raises alarm bells, especially as the work of planning and delivering the World Cup is well underway without those human rights guardrails in place. The Dignity 2026 Coalition calls on the FIFA officials convening on May 17 in Bangkok for the 74th Congress to rectify this critical human rights deficit in FIFA policy.

In early May, FIFA president Gianni Infantino traveled to Washington, D.C., to press the United States to expedite visas for fans. FIFA expects the US to implement many other government guarantees, including massive tax waivers and blanket exemptions from labor law.

“FIFA will need the buy-in of workers, communities, and elected officials for a successful tournament, and that will not happen unless FIFA keeps its promises on human rights,” said Cathy Feingold, director of the AFL-CIO’s International Department. “In light of its financial, operational, and legal demands on host governments, FIFA’s delays and silence on its human rights strategy are particularly glaring.”

The members of Dignity 2026—an alliance of organizations representing millions of civil society stakeholders in the US that works in close partnership with coalitions in Canada and Mexico—have strong concerns about the delay and the status of the concrete human rights standards that Dignity 2026 has advocated for with FIFA, host cities, and the US government. Several of the founding organizations of Dignity 2026, including Human Rights Watch and the AFL-CIO, had worked with the North American Bid Committee in 2018 to shape strong human rights language. Civil society support for the hosting of the 2026 World Cup in North America was premised on these commitments.

“Sports uplift the values of fair play and competition. International competitions like FIFA’s World Cup draw attention to equity, not just through play but by valuing fairness and an equal application of the rules, including the economics of sport,” said Jamal Watkins, Senior Vice President of Strategy and Advancement for the NAACP. “There are NAACP units in each of the 11 US host cities, and we want FIFA to know that we are watching. Through our close relationships, from Seattle to Miami, we are very familiar with the standards and tools in the framework that FIFA shared with host cities in March. We expect that document to be released at once.”

In 2010, FIFA awarded the 2022 World Cup to Qatar without any conditions on human rights protections, despite the country’s poor human rights record and massive infrastructure deficit. FIFA’s decision drew widespread criticism for the need to construct eight stadiums in dangerous heat and the lack of human and labor rights protections in place.

“In view of migrant worker deaths, discrimination against LGBT people, and other abuses at past World Cups, workers, local communities, and rights defenders deserve more than empty promises from FIFA,” said Minky Worden, director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch. “FIFA needs a concrete, published, and enforceable plan to protect labor and human rights around the 2026 World Cup.”

The Dignity Coalition is concerned that pressure from business partners and future World Cup host countries may account for FIFA’s stalling on human rights. In July, FIFA is expected to confirm that the 2030 World Cup will take place in Morocco, Portugal, and Spain, and that Saudi Arabia will host the 2034 World Cup, raising concerns globally about FIFA’s commitment to human and labor rights.

“FIFA has a chance to remake the world of sport into one that champions fundamental rights and principles on occupational health and safety, worker organizing, gender equality, forced labor, and more,” said Luc Triangle, general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation. “But it will lose all credibility if it abandons or dilutes concrete standards and implementation criteria that were developed with unions, fans, and human rights organizations.”

(Tokyo) – Japan ’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida should publicly call on Saudi Arabia ’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to respect human rights, Human Right Watch said today. The crown prince’s visit to Tokyo from May 20-23, 2024, is his first visit to Japan as Saudi Arabia’s prime minister.

As the Japanese government increases its engagement with Saudi Arabia, spanning sectors such as energy, trade, investment, and tourism, it should also be strengthening its calls for improvements in the country’s human rights situation. Most recently, during Saudi Arabia’s Universal Periodic Review at the United Nations Human Rights Council in January 2024, Japan urged Saudi Arabia to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as well as to “take further actions to ensure women’s rights and participation in society, including for women with disabilities.”

“A healthy and productive Japanese relationship with Saudi Arabia means publicly urging Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to respect the rights of women, human rights defenders, and migrant workers, among others,” said Kanae Doi , Japan director at Human Rights Watch. “A mutual understanding and respect for human rights are critical for a strong friendship between the two governments.”

Since Mohammed bin Salman came to power in 2017, Saudi Arabia has experienced the worst period of repression in the country’s modern history, Human Rights Watch said. Saudi Arabia formally enshrined male guardianship over women through its “personal status” law, issued on May 8, 2022. Although bin Salman and other Saudi officials touted the law as “ comprehensive ” and “ progressive ,” it contains discriminatory provisions against women concerning marriage, divorce, and decisions about their children, and includes provisions that facilitate domestic violence and sexual abuse in marriage.

Saudi women’s rights activists had long campaigned for a codified Personal Status Law that would end discrimination against women. However, the authorities provided them with no opportunity to offer input, as the bill was not made public before it was adopted. In recent years, Saudi women’s rights activists have faced arbitrary arrest and detention, torture , and travel bans . Women’s rights defenders, including Loujain al-Hathloul, Nassimah al-Sadah, and Samar Badawi, remain banned from travel and under suspended prison sentences, allowing the authorities to return them to prison for any perceived criminal activity. Kishida should urge Mohammed bin Salman to end the arbitrary travel bans on women’s rights defenders, including Loujain al-Hathloul.

Repression of civil and political rights has worsened as Saudi Arabian authorities arbitrarily arrest peaceful dissidents, public intellectuals, and activists. Dozens of Saudi human rights defenders and activists have been serving long prison sentences for criticizing government policies or advocating for political and rights reforms.

Saudi authorities increasingly target Saudi and non-Saudi social media users for their peaceful expression online and punish them with decades-long sentences, and even the death penalty. In July 2023, the Specialized Criminal Court, Saudi Arabia’s counterterrorism tribunal, convicted Muhammad al-Ghamdi, 54, a retired teacher, of several criminal offenses related solely to his peaceful expression online. The court sentenced him to death, using his tweets, retweets, and YouTube activity as the evidence against him.

Mohammed al-Rabea, a human rights activist; Abdulrahman al-Sadhan, an aid worker; and Waleed Abu al-Khair, a human rights lawyer; remain imprisoned on charges relating to peaceful expression or activism. Kishida should press Mohammed bin Salman to immediately and unconditionally release al-Rabea, al-Sadhan, and al-Khair, Human Rights Watch said.

Saudi Arabia’s economy relies heavily on migrant workers, who make up 42 percent of the population. These workers face widespread abuses including wage theft, exorbitant recruitment fees, and passport confiscation with little government protection. Despite recent reforms , the abusive kafala (sponsorship) system continues to give employers excessive power over migrant workers’ mobility and legal status in the country. Migrant workers struggle to change jobs or leave the country while many become undocumented because their employers do not issue or renew their residency permits.

Workers who leave their employers without consent can be falsely charged for “absconding,” even when they are fleeing abuse, and face imprisonment, and deportation. Migrants are denied the right to contest their detention and deportation. In addition to these widespread abuses, migrant domestic workers also face forced confinement, isolation, and physical and sexual abuse.

Kishida should press Mohammed bin Salman to fully dismantle the abusive kafala system and fully enforce the labor reforms to improve protections for workers.

Japan should be incorporating a strong human rights message in its growing dealings with Saudi Arabia, Human Rights Watch said. In 2017, the two governments established a “framework” called the “Japan-Saudi Vision 2030,” which “aims to facilitate public and private sector involvement between Saudi Arabia and Japan by aligning and reporting on strategic initiatives that contribute to the objectives of each country’s national growth and development strategies.”

During a July 2023 visit to Saudi Arabia, Kishida told the crown prince that “Japanese companies are highly interested in investing in Saudi Arabia and that a number of companies” had accompanied him. During his stay, Kishida also “expressed his desire to continue working closely with Saudi Arabia in addressing various challenges the international peace and security.”",VERY HIGH,20240517T031500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Loujain al-Hathloul, Nassimah al-Sadah, Samar Badawi, Muhammad al-Ghamdi, Mohammed al-Rabea, Abdulrahman al-Sadhan, Waleed Abu al-Khair",Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman,Saudi Arabia,"Call for the end of the kafala system, release of political prisoners, enforcement of women's rights and protections for migrant workers","Repression of human rights, including women's rights, treatment of migrant workers, and suppression of dissidents",Saudi Arabia,"Government policies, male guardianship laws, the kafala system"

(Ankara, May 17, 2024) – A Turkish court’s conviction on May 16, 2024, of 24 Kurdish politicians on bogus charges of crimes against the state follows a manifestly political and unjust trial, Human Rights Watch and the Turkey Human Rights Litigation Support Project said today. The court sentenced the 24 to prison terms ranging from 9 to 42 years, while acquitting 12 other politicians who had been on trial with them.

The politicians were from the parliamentary opposition party Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP), including former party co-chairs Selahattin Demirtaş and Figen Yüksekdağ. The ruling confirms that the Turkish authorities instrumentalized the criminal justice system to secure the politicians’ prolonged arbitrary detention on baseless charges and remove them from political life as elected representatives.

“The conviction of Selahattin Demirtaş, Figen Yüksekdağ, and other leading Kurdish opposition politicians in a mass trial is the latest move in a campaign of persecution that has robbed mainly Kurdish voters of their chosen representatives, undermined the democratic process, and criminalized lawful political speech,” said Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Using bogus criminal proceedings to remove democratically elected Kurdish politicians from political life will do nothing to end the Turkish state’s decades-long conflict with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK).”

In the Ankara 22nd Assize Court hearing, the court sentenced Selahattin Demirtaş to 42 years in prison, Figen Yüksekdağ to 30 years, and Gültan Kışanak, the former mayor of Diyarbakır, to 12 years, while releasing Kışanak and four others pending appeal. Ahmet Türk, the serving mayor of Mardin, was sentenced to 10 years in prison. The court ordered the continued detention of 13 defendants, including Demirtaş and Yüksekdağ. The former HDP members of parliament, elected mayors, and party officials have stood trial for the past three years on multiple charges, ranging from attempting to “destroy the unity and integrity of the state” and “membership of a terrorist organization” to “murder.” The evidence against them, as confirmed by the European Court of Human Rights, consists almost exclusively of their party’s social media posts and political speeches.

The core accusation in the 3,530-page indictment naming 108 defendants—of whom 36 stood trial—centers on four social media postings on October 6, 2014, from the Twitter account of the HDP alongside the politicians’ political speeches.

The prosecution added to the case file, several years after the events in question, a few statements, including from anonymous witnesses, making unsubstantiated and generalized assertions against the politicians. The addition of these dubious statements to the case file followed an arbitrary procedure that failed to respect the defendants’ basic fair trial guarantees.

The party’s 2014 tweets called on supporters to protest the ongoing siege of the Kurdish-majority Syrian town of Kobane by the extremist group Islamic State (ISIS). The indictment takes these tweets as grounds to hold the accused politicians directly responsible for the ensuing protests in 32 cities across Türkiye from October 6 to 8, 2014, in which violent clashes resulted in at least 37 deaths, the circumstances of which have never been fully elucidated. The trial of the politicians has been dubbed the “Kobane trial” in the media because of the reference to the Kobane protests.

The indictment charged the politicians with up to 30 offenses, including the main crime of attempting to “destroy the unity and integrity of the state,” as well as “murder,” “damage to property,” and “theft” in relation to the deaths and violence during the protests for which it held them liable. Ongoing criminal case files against the politicians in different courts charging them with crimes such as “membership of a terrorist organization” and “spreading terrorist propaganda” were then merged with the “Kobane trial” casefile.

The Ankara court’s verdict, which the convicted politicians said they would appeal, is the latest development in a long campaign of persecution against the pro-Kurdish rights HDP. The persecution has been led by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) government in coalition with the far-right Nationalist Action Party (MHP), Human Rights Watch and the Turkey Human Rights Litigation Support Project said.

The crackdown on the politicians followed the breakdown in 2015 of intensive efforts by the party and the government to bring an end to the decades-long conflict between the armed PKK and the Turkish state. In May 2016, in a rapid sequence of events, the government led a controversial move to lift the parliamentarians’ parliamentary immunity through a temporary constitutional amendment. On November 4, 2016, leading HDP members of parliament, and on separate dates elected mayors from a sister party, were arrested and jailed on terrorism charges .

Demirtaş and Yüksekdağ, the HDP’s former co-chairs, have remained in prison ever since. The party itself is fighting a case seeking its closure before Türkiye’s Constitutional Court.

The Ankara court’s verdict also flagrantly flouts two binding judgments of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). The ECtHR determined, in a judgment pertaining to Demirtaş in December 2020 and one pertaining to Yüksekdağ and 12 others in October 2022, that their detention on the basis of speeches and social media postings constituted a politically motivated move to silence them, “stifling pluralism and limiting freedom of political debate, the very core of the concept of a democratic society.” The ECtHR found that their rights to liberty, to freedom of expression, and to run for election had been violated and that the politicians must be released immediately.

The alleged facts forming the basis on which Demirtaş and Yüksekdağ are detained, and which form the basis of their conviction, are substantially the same as those contained in the proceedings which the ECtHR found to be insufficient grounds for their detention.

“The sentencing of Demirtaş, Yüksekdağ, and several other prominent opposition politicians in Türkiye to lengthy prison terms for their just political advocacy for Kurdish rights is yet another blow to hopes for positive change in the state of human rights, rule of law, and democracy in the country,” said Ayşe Bingöl Demir, director of the Turkey Human Rights Litigation Support Project. “This latest conviction, alongside ongoing arbitrary and politically charged detentions, blatantly violates international human rights standards and disregards ECtHR judgments. The international community now faces a critical choice: remain silent and risk complicity in these repressive practices, or call them out and take robust action, including initiating proceedings designated for such serious breaches of international obligations.”",VERY HIGH,20240517T031500Z,Human Rights Watch and the Turkey Human Rights Litigation Support Project,"Selahattin Demirtaş, Figen Yüksekdağ, Gültan Kışanak, Ahmet Türk",Turkish authorities,"Ankara, Türkiye","Call for international action against human rights violations in Türkiye, compliance with ECtHR judgments.",Bogus charges against Kurdish politicians,Türkiye,"Political persecution of the Kurdish minority, conflict with PKK"

(Athens, May 17, 2024) – The imminent trial of nine survivors of the June 2023 Pylos shipwreck off Greece raises fair trial concerns, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said today. The survivors are charged with smuggling, aggravated by the deaths of passengers, causing a shipwreck, irregular entry, and forming and membership of a criminal organization, and could face multiple life sentences if convicted. A parallel investigation into the potential liability of the Greek authorities for the shipwreck is at the preliminary stage, meaning the criminal court will have incomplete information in assessing the culpability of the defendants. The criminal trial is due to begin in Kalamata, Greece, on May 21, 2024.

“There’s a real risk that these nine survivors could be found ‘guilty’ on the basis of incomplete and questionable evidence given that the official investigation into the role of the Coast Guard has not yet been completed,” said Judith Sunderland, associate Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Credible and meaningful accountability for one of the worst shipwrecks in the Mediterranean needs to include a determination of any liabilities of Greek authorities.”

The severely overcrowded fishing trawler capsized on June 14, 2023, leading to the death of more than 600 of its estimated 750 passengers, mainly from Syria, Pakistan and Egypt. Research by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International and numerous investigative journalists and organizations points to several failures by the Greek authorities in the hours leading up to the shipwreck, as well as serious allegations that a Hellenic Coast Guard patrol boat caused the boat to capsize while attempting to tow it.

The case against the nine Egyptian survivors, referred to as the “Pylos 9” appears to be based on the theory that the poor and overcrowded state of the boat caused the shipwreck and that the defendants were smugglers in charge of the boat and its passengers, and therefore responsible for the deaths of those on board. The accused deny the charges. It is unclear whether and how the criminal court will examine the behavior of the Hellenic Coast Guard or the allegation that the attempt to tow the boat was the direct, material cause of the shipwreck.

A separate Naval Court investigation into the potential liability of the Hellenic Coast Guard, opened in June 2023, remains at the preliminary stages. Legal nongovernmental organizations joined the case filing a complaint on behalf of 53 survivors alleging that Greek authorities were responsible for the shipwreck, and many of them have been summoned to testify. The Naval Court prosecutor’s request for forensic analysis of coast guard officers’ phones – only seized by authorities in late September 2023, over two months after the events – is still pending.

The Pylos 9 were arrested on June 15, 2023, apparently on the basis of testimonies from nine other survivors taken by Hellenic Coast Guard officers in the immediate aftermath of the traumatic shipwreck, between June 14 and 15. It is unclear whether or how many other survivors gave their accounts and whether these were evaluated before the accused were arrested and subsequently sent into pretrial custody, on June 20.

Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have previously said that the fact that Coast Guard officials conducted the interviews raised concerns for the independence and integrity of the investigation, especially considering that allegations about the Coast Guard’s actions emerged soon after the shipwreck.

There are real concerns regarding the respect of fair trial standards based on questions about the integrity of the investigation and evidence, the organizations said. The speed at which the investigation against survivors was concluded, and the Pylos 9 defense lawyers’ lack of access to the Naval Court case file compound these concerns.

In separate investigations, Lighthouse Reports, Solomon, and others found that various survivors’ statements to the Coast Guard, admitted as evidence, described the shipwreck in identical terms and did not include allegations about the towing attempt, suggesting that those taking the first statements may have written official pro forma accounts rather than the actual accounts provided by survivors. However, in later testimony to the Kalamata prosecutor, several of those same survivors made the allegation of the towing attempt. One survivor also told Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch that his statement to the prosecutor that the Coast Guard had caused the fishing boat to capsize was changed to say that the boat sank due to other reasons.

Members of the Pylos 9 defense team told the organizations that the investigating judge in the Kalamata court rejected defendants’ requests to secure further evidence, including evidence pertaining to the potential liability of the Hellenic Coast Guard, on the grounds that it falls within the jurisdiction of the Naval Court. The defendants’ lawyers have been unable to gain access to the investigation file before the Naval Court despite its clear relevance to preparing the defense.

The judge rejected the request for analysis of any data from survivors’ mobile phones which were confiscated by Greek authorities under unclear circumstances, then reportedly discovered on the coast guard boat and seized as part of the Kalamata investigation only in July 2023. The judge also rejected motions by defense lawyers to take testimony from additional survivors, and to acquire the communications between the Hellenic Coast Guard, Frontex and the Greek Joint Rescue Coordination Center, and aerial photos of the boat prior to the shipwreck.

The separate investigation into the Hellenic Coast Guard’s potential liability should not impede the defendants’ access to crucial, and potentially exculpatory, evidence on the causes of the shipwreck, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said. The Kalamata and Naval courts should cooperate in the interests of justice, with the goal of achieving as full and credible an account of how the shipwreck occurred and identifying those responsible and any alleged fatal shortcomings in the rescue efforts.

International and European human rights law guarantees a defendant’s right to an effective defense when facing a criminal charge. Among other things, this means the defendants have the right to “adequate facilities” for preparing their defense, including “all materials that the prosecution plans to offer in court against the accused or that are exculpatory.”

The Kalamata court should guarantee that the Pylos 9 receive a fair and impartial trial, and that their full due process rights are upheld and respected. The Naval Court should advance investigations promptly, effectively and impartially and ensure the safe and effective participation of the largest possible number of survivors and relatives of victims and full collection of evidence.

“Time and again, in Greece and in other countries, racialised people who are seeking to travel to Europe end up being the only ones facing accountability in the context of migration movements,” said Adriana Tidona, Migration researcher at Amnesty International. “The Pylos investigations and trials must serve as a turning point for this dangerous trajectory.”

After examining 81 trials in Greece, the nongovernmental group Borderline Europe found that “smuggled people themselves, including asylum seekers, are systematically convicted of smuggling because they (allegedly) drove or assisted in driving the boat or car” and denounced serious shortcomings and abuses in the context of arrests and preliminary investigations.

Update May 17, 2024: On May 16, Saadia Mosbah and at least two people connected to Terre d'Asile Tunisie (Land of Asylum Tunisia) appeared before a judge and were placed in pretrial detention.

civil society to operate fully and freely. (Beirut) – Tunisian authorities have arrested at least nine people amid escalating government actions in recent weeks to muzzle free speech, prosecute dissent, and crack down on migrants and asylum seekers, Human Rights Watch said today. Tunisian authorities should respect and protect space for independentto operate fully and freely.

Between May 3 and 13, 2024, security forces arrested two prominent lawyers and two well-known journalists, as well as at least five members of at least three legally registered nongovernmental organizations working on migration, asylum, and racial justice: Mnemty, the Tunisian Refugee Council, and Terre d’Asile Tunisie. In total, members of at least eight nongovernmental organizations have been investigated or summoned.

“The clampdown on migration-related work at the same time as the increasing arrest of government critics and journalists sends a chilling message that anyone who doesn't fall in line may end up in the authorities’ crosshairs,” said Lama Fakih, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “By targeting these civil society groups, Tunisian authorities jeopardize the vital support they provide migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers living in extremely vulnerable situations.”

On May 11, security officers stormed the Tunisian Bar Association’s headquarters during a live television broadcast, arresting a media commentator and lawyer, Sonia Dahmani, for sarcastic comments made on May 7 questioning the claim that Black African migrants were seeking to settle in Tunisia. Based on media reports, Dahmani’s arrest and subsequent detention was based on Decree-Law 54 on cybercrime, which imposes heavy prison sentences for spreading “fake news” and “rumors” online and in the media, after she refused to respond to a summons for questioning.

The same evening, authorities also arrested two other journalists and colleagues of Dahmani—Mourad Zeghidi and Borhen Bsaies—in connection with unrelated statements made in the media and online, also under Decree-Law 54. They have been placed in pretrial detention pending trial on April 22.

On May 13, security officers arrested Mehdi Zagrouba, a lawyer and government critic. Tunisia’s Interior Ministry said in a statement that Zagrouba was arrested because he had assaulted police officers that day near a Tunis court. On May 15, Tunisian President Kais Saied said in a statement that “those who dare to denigrate their country in the media and who violently assaulted police officers ... cannot remain unaccountable,” in indirect reference to Dahmani and Zagrouba.

Security forces arrested Saadia Mosbah, the head of the anti-racism organization Mnemty (My Dream), and Zied Rouin, the organization's program coordinator, on May 6. They also searched Mosbah’s home and the group’s offices, confiscating devices and documents. While Rouin was released after questioning, a public prosecutor placed Mosbah in custody for 10 days as part of an investigation into alleged financial crimes under Tunisia’s 2015 counterterrorism law. A person close to the case told Human Rights Watch that security forces questioned Mosbah about Mnemty’s funding and activities.

Mosbah is a prominent Black Tunisian activist and a pioneer in the fight against racism in Tunisia who contributed to the adoption in 2018 of a landmark law for the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination. Pro-government social media accounts engaged in an aggressive online smear campaign against Mosbah that gained traction days before her arrest, Human Rights Watch said.

The same day as Mosbah’s arrest, Saied said that foreign funding was being funneled to national organizations to settle migrants in Tunisia illegally and referred to the heads of the organizations as “traitors.” He also confirmed that Tunisian authorities were expelling migrants to border areas in “continued cooperation” with neighboring countries. On May 3 and 4, security forces raided at least two makeshift camps and a youth hostel in Tunis and evicted hundreds of Black African migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers. At least 80 of them were arrested and 400 were expelled to the country’s borders, according to the authorities. These constitute unlawful collective expulsions, which are prohibited by the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, Human Rights Watch said.

Saied's comments strongly echoed his February 2023 speech, which led to a surge in attacks and abuses by both Tunisian citizens and security forces against Black Africans in Tunisia. At the time, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination called Saied’s speech racist and considered that such remarks violate the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, to which Tunisia is a state party.

On May 7, a court spokesperson told the national news agency that the president and vice president of a civil society group had been detained that day on suspicion of embezzlement and financial misconduct. Though they were not named, Human Rights Watch confirmed that these remarks were in reference to the president and vice president of the Tunisian Refugee Council (Conseil Tunisien pour les Réfugiés, CTR).

Based on the spokesperson’s comments to the media, the public prosecutor’s office accused the heads of the CTR of “forming a criminal association with the aim of helping people to enter Tunisia” illegally in connection with a “call for tenders to Tunisian hotel establishments for the accommodation of African migrants” that their organization published “without coordination with the security and administrative authorities,” referring to its work with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

The CTR was formed in 2016 and has been a key partner of the UNHCR in Tunisia, being primarily responsible for the collection and initial screening of asylum applications, which are subsequently processed by UNHCR.

The CTR also provides other services to support the UNHCR’s mandate, such as arranging emergency accommodation and medical assistance for refugees and asylum seekers. On May 2, it published a public tender for Tunisian hotels to provide services for the CTR’s beneficiaries, sparking a backlash on social media and among parliament members.

The court spokesperson also said that another group supporting asylum seekers and refugees in Tunisia was also being investigated. Sources told Human Rights Watch that the spokesperson was referring to Terre d’Asile Tunisie (Land of Asylum Tunisia), and that at least two people linked to the organization had been arrested on May 8.

The Tunisian police, military, and National Guard, including the Coast Guard, have committed serious abuses against Black African migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers in recent years, with abuses increasing since 2023. Human Rights Watch has documented beatings, use of excessive force, some cases of torture, arbitrary arrests and detention, collective expulsions, dangerous actions at sea during boat interceptions, forced evictions, and the theft of money and belongings.

As of April 30, over 17,000 refugees and asylum seekers were registered with the UNHCR in Tunisia. Over 7,000 are Sudanese, including many who have fled Sudan’s conflict since April 2023.

On May 15, the European Union and France issued statements expressing concern over the recent arrests of civil society representatives in Tunisia. The EU said its delegation in the country had made inquiries to the authorities about the reasons for the arrests. Saied indirectly referred to these statements later that day, saying they were an unacceptable foreign intervention.

On July 16, 2023, the EU signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Tunisia that included a funding package of up to €1 billion, including €105 million to curb irregular migration, without any specific human rights guarantees for migrants and asylum seekers.

The EU Commission should ensure that no EU funding is disbursed to governmental entities that commit human rights abuses against migrants or asylum seekers, and they should tie future migration cooperation with Tunisia to genuine guarantees that civil society groups working on migrant and refugee rights can perform their activities without fear of harassment or reprisal.

According to the Tunisian government, a draft law on associations is currently being finalized by the Tunisian Justice Ministry. Leaked drafts since 2022 suggest that the government may give the administration overly broad powers and discretion to interfere with the way civil society organizations are formed, their functions and operations, and their funding. Human Rights Watch has previously expressed concerns about another draft law on associations.

Since July 25, 2021, Saied has dismantled Tunisia’s democratic institutions, undermined judicial independence, and stifled the exercise of freedom of expression and the press, Human Rights Watch said. Tunisia’s international partners should press the government to drop the plan to adopt the draft law on civil society organizations, which if passed would undermine freedom of association in the country.

“Targeting nongovernmental groups supporting migrants, asylum seekers, and refugees is part of a broader effort to dismantle Tunisia's civic space,” Fakih said. “The EU, which has pledged millions to Tunisia on migration cooperation, should ensure that the authorities protect space for independent civil society to work on these issues in the country.”",HIGH,20240517T073000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Saadia Mosbah, Sonia Dahmani, Mehdi Zagrouba, Zied Rouin, Mourad Zeghidi, Borhen Bsaies",Tunisian authorities,Tunisia,"Press the government to respect human rights, ensure civil society can work freely, and tie EU funding to human rights guarantees.","Arrest and crackdown on civil society, journalists, and migrants",Tunisia,Government actions to suppress dissent and control civil society

This week marked ten years since the death of Camille Lepage, a French photojournalist who was killed while working in western Central African Republic (CAR). She was a true friend to a country in need of people to bear witness to abuse. Camille was 26.

Months before her arrival in CAR in 2013, an alliance of rebel groups known as the Seleka took control of Bangui, the capital. By then they had also seized control of most of the country’s provinces, and its fighters unleashed waves of violence against civilians across the country. Camille arrived later that year as Christian and animist militias, known as anti-balaka, began to organize counter attacks against the Seleka. The group frequently targeted Muslim civilians, associating them with the Seleka. As the humanitarian situation rapidly deteriorated, hundreds of thousands of people fled the country as refugees, while others were displaced internally.

As people were fleeing, Camille went in. She used her camera lens to tell the story of those who had been left behind. She knew it was a forgotten crisis and knew she had a way to help.

Camille’s photos continue to be some of the most striking images that illustrate the human cost of the conflict in those early years. She gave faces to the victims and survivors, capturing in an image the fear of battle, the agony of losing a loved one, the injustice of war crimes. I remember accompanying her on a protest, where people called for justice for a slain judge. Ten years on, the images she took that day still stand as a testament to CAR’s indefatigable calls for justice and accountability.

Since Camille was killed, the Central African Republic continues to be one of the most dangerous places for humanitarians to work. Impunity is a key driver of abuse; there has been too little accountability for the war crimes committed across the country. Camille’s case is emblematic of this, as there has been little movement on bringing her killers to justice.

A book of Camille’s photography was issued after her death. Its title, Republique Centrafricaine: On est ensemble (Central African Republic: We Are Together), represents both Camille’s ties to the country and a common phrase she would say in Sango, the local language. After ten years, Camille is still connected to the country and her legacy lives on.",HIGH,20240517T214500Z,Camille Lepage (posthumously),Camille Lepage,Seleka rebel groups and anti-balaka militias,Bangui and other provinces in Central African Republic,"Increased protection for human rights defenders, accountability measures for war crimes",Violence against civilians and war crimes,Central African Republic,"Political instability, ethnic tensions, power struggles between rebel groups"

Hundreds of thousands of civilians are at risk of again becoming victims of atrocities, this time in the North Darfur city of El Fasher, amid fighting between the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), as well as allied militias. Fighting began in April, and the last week has seen fierce clashes in and around the city, including deliberate attacks on civilians, burning of residential neighborhoods, and indiscriminate bombing and shelling.

Tens of thousands of people in El Fasher have already been displaced, with many civilians trapped in the city without access to aid. A telecommunications blackout is also hampering real-time reporting.

Observers within the United Nations, governments, and civil society have warned an attack on El Fasher would cause immeasurable suffering. On May 15, the United States sanctioned two high-level RSF commanders, one for involvement in leading the attacks on El Fasher, but greater focus on civilian protection is needed.

Satellite imagery indicates fires in the eastern part of the city since at least April 18, with an increase from May 10 to 12, days when fighting in the city spiraled. The images show burn marks in the city that suggest targeting of non-Arab neighbourhoods. We also geolocated videos posted online of RSF soldiers close to residential areas ablaze. This is consistent with the RSF and allied forces’ modus operandi in West Darfur last year.

Bombing and shelling in the city is also costing lives. On May 15, Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors without Borders or MSF), one of the only aid groups present in El Fasher, said the South Hospital, which it supports, had received 454 casualties, 56 of them succumbing to their injuries since May 10. MSF also reported that on May 11, a SAF airstrike 25 meters from a pediatric hospital had killed two children and at least one caregiver and forced the hospital to stop operations. The strike left an approximately 5 meter-wide crater near the hospital visible on satellite imagery.

Last week Human Rights Watch released a report documenting war crimes and crimes against humanity by the RSF and allied militias in West Darfur’s El Geneina. The ongoing assault in El Fasher bears stark similarities to these findings and warns of a tragedy which may repeat itself.

Concerted global action is needed now.

We write to express our support for a new optional protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) focused on the right to free education.[1] The aim of this initiative is to ensure recognition under international law of the right to free early childhood education and free secondary education, alongside the already-existing right to free and compulsory primary education.

Well-established scientific evidence shows unequivocally that education is foundational to children’s healthy development, wellbeing, fulfilment of their full potential, and their lifelong prospects. Not only is education valuable in its own right, it has a multiplier effect—that is, education helps position children to secure their other rights during childhood and subsequently as adults. At a societal level, investing in education is any country’s most effective policy tool to ensure prosperity, social cohesion, and sustainable development.

Although research evidence is clear on the importance of education to children’s holistic development, international law has not kept pace. In 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights—the foundational instrument of the modern human rights movement—recognized every individual has the right to education, mandating that primary education be free and compulsory for all. In the more than 70 years since then, the international law standard on the right to education has changed little. While the right to education has been enshrined in legally-binding treaties—including the Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966)—international law has not expressly recognized early childhood education (pre-primary education) or mandated free secondary education for all children. These treaties have been silent on early childhood education, while calling on states to make secondary education “available and accessible” but stopping short of requiring that it be made available free. We believe it is time for that to change.

International consensus and frameworks (e.g., the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals) urge access to high-quality early childhood education, which, according to the Committee on the Rights of the Child’s “General Comment No. 7 on Implementing Child Rights in Early Childhood”, must be understood as beginning at birth. Similarly, evidence from research on adolescent development reveals the importance of secondary education to children’s healthy development and lifelong prospects, including their capacity to navigate the complexities of our world in the 21st Century.

While the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call on states to ensure all children have access to quality early childhood education and care (SDG 4.2) and free secondary education (SDG 4.1), global monitoring data show the world is far from achieving the 2030 targets. Significant disparities persist among—and within—countries and regions, compounding stark inequalities of access, opportunity, condition, and outcome, especially for children from disadvantaged and marginalized communities. We therefore call for an urgent renewed commitment to education systems that realize just and equitable outcomes for ALL children. And we believe it is essential that this commitment be backed by a legal mandate to ensure its success.

The world has changed dramatically since 1948, and our understanding of how children develop and flourish has advanced significantly. To ensure education systems contribute to realizing children’s rights enshrined in UNCRC, it is critical that we secure their right to education from birth through secondary education.

We, therefore, call on all U.N. member states to support a new optional protocol to the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child that will recognize the importance of education to children’s healthy development by mandating that governments ensure every child has access to free pre-primary[2], primary, and secondary education.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s June 5 visit to Albania’s Shëngjin port underscores the folly of Italy’s scheme to send migrants and asylum seekers, intercepted in the Mediterranean Sea, to Albania. Amid spiraling costs, delays, and serious concerns about people’s rights, the plan is revealing itself to be an example of how not to manage migration.

The scheme, agreed upon last November, commits Italy to setting up a processing center at the Shëngjin port, plus a reception center for asylum seekers with 880 places, as well as a detention center with 144 places. The reception and detention centers will be in Gjadër municipality.

Italy says it will send only adult men from countries it designates as “safe” to Albania to undergo an accelerated asylum procedure, followed by quick deportation for those denied protection. But some countries so designated are not “safe” for everyone: there are documented cases of torture and other serious human rights violations in Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, and Cameroon, for example.

How Italy will guarantee a fair asylum procedure and judicial review of detention in another state remains a mystery.

Meloni now says the centers, originally slated to become operational in May, will be ready by August. Construction costs have increased by more than 25 million euros, while the overall budget for the scheme’s operation over the next five years, according to the government, is €670 million (others say it will cost up to €850 million).

Italy’s government recently opened a bid for private contractors that shows how they plan to implement the deal. It wants a private ship with room for 300 people (200 migrants and 100 staff) to receive people directly from Italian state vessels at sea, south of the Italian island Lampedusa. They will then be transferred to Albania. The operating budget for three months, starting in mid-September, is 13.5 million euros. It remains unclear how, where, and by whom assessments will be made to determine who among those rescued or intercepted should be sent to Albania.

Far from illustrating “a model to follow,” the visit showcased once more that Meloni’s government doesn’t have a sensible or humane approach to migration. The Italy-Albania deal is costly, puts peoples’ rights at risk, and will likely do little to deter people from taking boats across the Mediterranean.

(Beirut) – Israel’s widespread use of white phosphorus in south Lebanon is putting civilians at grave risk and contributing to civilian displacement, Human Rights Watch said today. Human Rights Watch verified the use of white phosphorus munitions by Israeli forces in at least 17 municipalities across south Lebanon since October 2023, including 5 municipalities where airburst munitions were unlawfully used over populated residential areas.

White phosphorus is a chemical substance dispersed in artillery shells, bombs, and rockets that ignites when exposed to oxygen. Its incendiary effects inflict death or cruel injuries that result in lifelong suffering. It can set homes, agricultural areas, and other civilian objects on fire. Under international humanitarian law, the use of airburst white phosphorus is unlawfully indiscriminate in populated areas and otherwise does not meet the legal requirement to take all feasible precautions to avoid civilian harm.

“Israel’s use of airburst white phosphorus munitions in populated areas indiscriminately harms civilians and has led many to leave their homes,” said Ramzi Kaiss, Lebanon researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Israel forces should immediately stop using white phosphorus munitions in populated areas, especially when less-harmful alternatives are readily available.”

Human Rights Watch interviewed eight south Lebanon residents and verified and geolocated 47 photos and videos from south Lebanon posted on social media or shared directly with researchers indicating the use of white phosphorus munitions. In five municipalities, photos and videos show airburst munitions containing white phosphorus landing on top of residential buildings in the southern Lebanese border villages of Kafr Kila, Mays al-Jabal, Boustane, Markaba, and Aita al-Chaab.

The mayor of Boustane said that two people from the village had to be rushed to the hospital as a result of asphyxiation from inhaling white phosphorus smoke following the attack on October 15. “These are civilians, who were both in their houses,” the mayor said. “One was a member of the municipality, and the other was a farmer.”

People told Human Rights Watch that the use of white phosphorus in populated areas in south Lebanon contributed to the displacement of residents from several villages at the Lebanon-Israel border.

Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health said that, as of May 28, exposure to white phosphorus had injured at least 173 people since October. Human Rights Watch did not obtain evidence of any burn injuries resulting from the use of white phosphorus munitions but heard accounts indicating possible respiratory damage.

“The most severe effects of white phosphorus are the dermal or skin effects, which can include second and third degree burns that can lead to very significant, deep necrotic and full thickness burns,” said Dr. Tharwat Zahran, a medical toxicologist and assistant professor of emergency medicine at the American University of Beirut. “Exposure to white phosphorus smoke could [also] lead to acute upper respiratory damages including shortness of breath, fast breathing, [and] coughing, but it could also have delayed effects, [including] chemical pneumonitis, which might require hospitalization and respiratory support through a machine.”

Israel’s widespread use of white phosphorus in south Lebanon highlights the need for stronger international law on incendiary weapons, Human Rights Watch said. Protocol III of the Convention on Conventional Weapons is the only legally binding instrument dedicated specifically to incendiary weapons. Lebanon is party to Protocol III, while Israel is not.

Protocol III applies to weapons that are “primarily designed” to set fires or cause burns, and thus excludes certain multipurpose munitions with incendiary effects, notably those containing white phosphorus. In addition, it has weaker regulations for the use in “concentrations of civilians” of ground-launched incendiary weapons – like the ones used in Lebanon – than air-dropped incendiary weapons, even though they produce the same horrific injuries.

“Concentrations of civilians” is defined broadly to encompass populated areas ranging from villages to refugee camps to cities. Human Rights Watch and many countries have long called for closing these loopholes in Protocol III and creating international norms that better protect civilians from the harm caused by incendiary weapons.

At a national level, Israel should prohibit all use of airburst white phosphorus munitions in populated areas because it puts civilians at risk of indiscriminate attacks. There are available alternatives to white phosphorus in smoke shells, including some produced by Israeli companies, such as the M150 smoke projectile, which the Israeli army has used for its forces in the past as an obscurant, a means of hindering the visibility of its forces. These alternatives can have the same effect and dramatically reduce the harm to civilians.

Lebanon should promptly file a declaration with the International Criminal Court (ICC), enabling the investigation and prosecution of grave international crimes within the court’s jurisdiction on Lebanese territory since October 2023.

“Stronger international standards against the use of white phosphorus are needed to ensure these weapons do not continue to endanger civilians,” Kaiss said. “Israel’s recent use of white phosphorus in Lebanon should motivate other countries to take immediate action toward this goal.”

White Phosphorus Use in Armed Conflict

White phosphorus can be used as a military tool to obscure, mark, or signal, or as a weapon to smoke out enemy forces. Concerns over its use in populated areas are amplified given the indiscriminate technique shown in videos of air-bursting white phosphorus projectiles, which spread 116 burning felt wedges impregnated with the substance over an area between 125 and 250 meters in diameter, depending on the altitude and angle of the burst, exposing more civilians and civilian structures to potential harm than a localized ground burst.

White phosphorus ignites when exposed to atmospheric oxygen and continues to burn until it is deprived of oxygen or is exhausted. Its chemical reaction can create intense heat (about 815°C/1,500°F), light, and smoke.

White phosphorus that contacts people can burn down to the bone. Fragments of white phosphorus can exacerbate wounds even after treatment and can enter the bloodstream and cause multiple organ failures. Already dressed wounds can reignite when dressings are removed and the wounds are reexposed to oxygen. Even relatively minor burns are often fatal. For survivors, extensive scarring tightens muscle tissue and creates physical disabilities. The trauma of the attack, the painful treatment that follows, and appearance-changing scars lead to psychological harm and social exclusion.

Rocket and missile attacks and armed clashes between the Israeli military and various Lebanese armed groups, including Hezbollah, have continued since October 8, the day after the Hamas-led attack by Palestinian armed groups in southern Israel killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to the Israeli government. As of May 29, at least 36,171 Palestinians have been killed amid heavy bombardment and military operations in Gaza by Israeli forces since October 7.

Human Rights Watch has documented the Israeli military’s use of artillery-fired white phosphorus in south Lebanon and Gaza in October 2023, in addition to previous hostilities in Gaza, including in 2009.

Human Rights Watch previously verified the use of artillery-fired white phosphorus munitions in south Lebanon on October 10 in two locations near the Israel-Lebanon border and in Gaza City. On October 12, the Israeli military spokesman denied the use of white phosphorus munitions in south Lebanon and in Gaza during a CNN interview.

On October 30, Amnesty International found that an October 16 attack on the Lebanese border village of Dhayra using white phosphorus munitions was an “indiscriminate attack that injured at least nine civilians and damaged civilian objects.” The attack included use of US-supplied white phosphorus munitions, according to the Washington Post, which carried out its own investigation.

The Israeli military said that its main smoke shells do not contain white phosphorus, but stated that “similar to many Western armies, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] also has smoke shells that contain white phosphorus ... and the choice to use them is influenced by operational considerations and availability compared to alternatives.” The military further said that such munitions “are intended for smokescreens, and not for an attack or ignition.”

The dispersal of felt wedges from white phosphorus munitions, as observed in photos and videos reviewed by Human Rights Watch, are consistent with artillery-fired projectiles reportedly used by the Israeli military in both Gaza and south Lebanon.

As of May 29, Israeli attacks in Lebanon since October 2023 have reportedly killed at least 88 civilians, in addition to more than 300 fighters, according to media reports. Attacks in Israel by Hezbollah and armed Palestinian groups in Lebanon since October 2023 have reportedly killed at least 11 civilians and 14 soldiers. More than 93,000 people have been displaced from their homes in south Lebanon and at least 80,000 people have been displaced from northern Israel.

Methodology

Human Rights Watch researchers reviewed over 100 photos and videos posted on social media and shared by journalists, news agencies, and residents of south Lebanon, in addition to footage shared directly with researchers. Researchers identified use of white phosphorus munitions in 47 of these photos and videos, then geolocated those photos and videos to confirm their locations and, when possible, precisely identify the area where the burst felt wedges impregnated with white phosphorus had landed.

Human Rights Watch also spoke to eight south Lebanon residents, including the head of the union of agricultural workers in south Lebanon, a schoolteacher, two photographers working in the region, a rescue worker with the Lebanese Civil Defense, and the mayors of Kafr Kila, Mays al-Jabal, and Boustane. Human Rights Watch also spoke to a medical toxicologist in Beirut.

On May 22, Human Rights Watch sent a letter with findings and questions concerning the use of white phosphorus to the Israeli military but has not received a response.

Documented Use in Populated Areas

Through its analysis of verified videos and photos, Human Rights Watch identified the use of white phosphorus munitions in 17 municipalities across south Lebanon since October 2023. This includes five municipalities where airburst munitions were used over populated areas. In videos and photos posted on social media or published by news agencies from the villages of Boustane on October 15, from Kafr Kila on November 12, January 14 and January 31, from Mays al-Jabal on November 12, from Markaba on March 4, and Aita al-Chaab on April 3, burning felt wedges visibly landed directly on top of residential buildings.

Human Rights Watch was unable to determine whether there were military targets in areas where Israeli forces used white phosphorus munitions in south Lebanon.

The mayor of Boustane said that nearly all residents had still been living in the village when it was attacked. “During the first week of the war almost all 900 residents of Boustane were still in the village,” he said. “After two weeks, almost 700 people were left. [...] Then we had only around 14 families. [...] Gradually they kept decreasing, and now there are only four people left.”

Data collected by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) for the period between October 10 to 15 indicates that displacement from the village was minimal until the date of the attack. When Boustane was attacked on October 15, virtually all of the population remained in the village.

In Mays al-Jabal, the mayor of the village, Abdelmonem Choucair, said that “around 25 people, all civilians, were sent to hospitals because of white phosphorus during the first months of the war.” Human Rights Watch verified photos and videos showing white phosphorus munitions being used in Mays al-Jabal in videos and photos posted on social media on November 12 and December 5.

“The use of the white phosphorus munitions in Mays al-Jabal pushed people out of the village and turned it into a military zone,” Choucair said.

The mayor of Kafr Kila said that he estimates that at the time of the white phosphorus attack in November, about 50 to 70 percent of the residents were still living there. “People stayed in their houses, although they would leave for some time and then come back,” he said. “But from January onwards, the village started emptying out. It was the use of white phosphorus and also the direct strikes on residential houses that pushed people to leave.”

Human Rights Watch verified photos and videos shared by news agencies or posted on social media on October 17, November 12, January 14, January 31, and March 2 showing white phosphorus munitions being used in Kafr Kila.

A photographer said that after inhaling smoke from white phosphorus munitions used in an attack in Kafr Kila, he stayed in bed, sleeping, for two days. “To this day, my wife tells me I still have a cough.”

“At one point I had to get closer to the white phosphorus smoke to get out of the village because the phosphorus was on the outskirts,” the man said. “I had my windows open while driving, and the smoke went into the car. I’m not sure what happened but I’m sure that I inhaled […] I felt my stomach turning. My throat, lungs, and stomach felt awful. I got diarrhea that night. After that I couldn’t eat for a while, for about five days or so.”

Ramiz Dallah, a photographer from south Lebanon, who shared footage he took of white phosphorus attacks on the village of Shebaa, which Human Rights Watch verified, said that after one attack in December the smoke from the shells covered portions of the Shebaa valley and the village itself.

“Many people started getting scared of buying anything from the village or from the south because they’re afraid it may have been hit with [white] phosphorus,” he said. “People didn’t want to buy produce from our village. I’ve smelled and inhaled white phosphorus when they struck Shebaa. All this smoke inside my body I don’t know what its effects are going to be on the long term.”

Dr. Zahran, the medical toxicologist, said that doctors found in some cases that “people who went to check on their houses had secondary exposure where they experienced respiratory symptoms due to inhalation of white phosphorus that was still burning and present in the impacted area.”

Israel’s Policy on White Phosphorus Use

In 2013, the Israeli armed forces announced that they were developing new smoke shells without white phosphorus. The military said that it would nonetheless use and stockpile its white phosphorus munitions until it had sufficient alternatives but said that “[d]epending on the outcome of this development process, the new shells are intended to gradually replace the current smoke shells as the primary means employed by the IDF for screening purposes.”

The move to develop alternatives came after Israel’s Operation Cast Lead in Gaza from December 27, 2008, to January 18, 2009, when the Israeli military fired approximately 200 ground-launched white phosphorus munitions into populated areas of Gaza. Israeli forces relied particularly on 155mm M825E1 artillery projectiles, which send burning phosphorus wedges 125 meters in all directions, giving them a wide area effect. Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the Israeli military used the shells only to create smokescreens. However, in March 2009, Human Rights Watch documented dozens of civilian casualties in the six incidents it researched. The white phosphorus munitions also damaged civilian structures, including a school, a market, a humanitarian aid warehouse, and a hospital.

This use of white phosphorus generated international and domestic outcry and scrutiny. In 2013, in response to a petition before Israel’s High Court of Justice regarding the Gaza attacks, the Israeli military asserted that it would no longer use white phosphorus in populated areas except in two narrow situations that it revealed only to the justices. In the court’s ruling, Justice Edna Arbel explained that the conditions would “render use of white phosphorous an extreme exception in highly particular circumstances.” Although this pledge to the court did not represent an official change in policy, Justice Arbel called on the Israeli military to conduct a “thorough and comprehensive examination” and adopt a permanent military directive.",VERY HIGH,20240605T051500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Ramzi Kaiss (Human Rights Watch), Dr. Tharwat Zahran (medical toxicologist)",Israeli forces,17 municipalities across south Lebanon,"Prohibit use of airburst white phosphorus in populated areas, develop alternatives to white phosphorus munitions for military use.",Widespread use of white phosphorus munitions in populated areas resulting in civilian harm,Israel,Military strategy of Israeli armed forces

The Israeli military has been using white phosphorus in Gaza and south Lebanon. There’s a lot of confusion out there about white phosphorus, so let’s look at what it is, what it isn’t, and how it’s problematic.

White phosphorus is a chemical substance, dispersed in artillery shells, bombs, and rockets. When exposed to oxygen, it ignites, and the chemical reaction produces intense heat (815°C, 1500°F), light, and thick smoke. It is commonly used as a military tool to create a smokescreen to obscure military operations, or to make enemy targeting more difficult, or mark enemy targets.

It also inflicts appalling injuries when it comes in contact with people. White phosphorus is not considered a chemical weapon, because it operates primarily by heat and flame rather than toxicity, but its impact on the human body is nonetheless horrific.

It causes severe burns, often down to the bone, and burns on only ten percent of the body are often fatal. It can also cause respiratory damage and organ failure. Survivors often experience a lifetime of suffering.

White phosphorus can be burst over or on an area at different heights. When released on or near the ground, the area immediately affected is generally smaller. When airburst, however, white phosphorus covers a larger area and spreads its incendiary effects more widely. If an airburst is over a populated area, the risks to civilians are obvious.

White phosphorus is not specifically banned by international humanitarian law. However, like all actions in a conflict, its use is still bound by the laws of war, whose core concept is that all parties to a conflict must distinguish, at all times, between combatants and civilians. The law requires all parties to take all feasible precautions to minimise harm to civilians and civilian objects.

Using airburst white phosphorus is unlawfully indiscriminate in populated areas and otherwise does not meet this legal requirement to take all feasible precautions to avoid civilian harm. White phosphorus doesn’t discriminate, falling on military opponents and civilians alike.

This brings us to Israel’s actions in Gaza and south Lebanon. We’ve written about this before, but a new report further documents Israel’s widespread use of white phosphorus in south Lebanon since October. This includes at least five municipalities where white phosphorus munitions were unlawfully airburst over populated residential areas, putting civilians at grave risk.

So, what’s to be done?

In the immediate term, Israel should prohibit all use of airburst white phosphorus munitions in populated areas. Israel has already developed different munitions as a replacement, so why aren’t they using them?

Lebanon, for its part, should turn to the International Criminal Court and enable the investigation and prosecution of grave international crimes on Lebanese territory since October.

And in the longer term and globally, stronger international standards are needed against the use of white phosphorus. We should work to protect civilians everywhere from the harmful effects of incendiary weapons.",HIGH,20240605T144500Z,Human rights organizations,,Israeli military,Gaza and south Lebanon,Prohibit airburst white phosphorus munitions in populated areas; establish stronger international standards,Use of white phosphorus in populated areas,Israel,Military strategy to obscure operations and target enemy

What follows is a noteworthy success story. But should it be?

Seeing that the authorities in Iraq were not upholding laws ensuring employment rights for people with disabilities, some folks decided to take matters into their own hands.

Activist Muwafaq al-Khafaji runs workshops to educate employers on employment rights for people with disabilities. He also encourages them to hire people with disabilities.

After one such workshop, a man named Muhammed Ali al-Mayahi decided to heed the call. Al-Mayahi is CEO of the Bab al-Agha Bakeries in Baghdad. (They have a gorgeous website, by the way.)

First, he hired five deaf employees. When he saw they were doing well, he hired more, and then still more. Today, they have almost 30 deaf employees.

In Al-Mayahi’s words: “Their competence and energy are very high. We must ensure that these people can live their lives just as everyone else here in Iraq. I hope that all companies will follow our example.”

Deaf employees at the bakery say their employment has had a hugely positive impact on their lives.

“Since I was hired here, my life has changed,” Shaima, 24, said. “Today, I can communicate with people, make a living, and rely on myself.”

It’s a success story, sure, but it shouldn’t be anything unusual. Of course, deaf folks and other people with disabilities can work in a bakery and do countless other jobs. There shouldn’t even be a story here.

In Iraq, however, it is a noteworthy story, because it’s exceptional. But it wouldn’t be exceptional, if the authorities implemented the law.

Federal Iraqi law allocates five percent of public sector jobs and three percent of private sector jobs to people with disabilities. The Kurdistan Region of Iraq has a similar law.

These laws have been around for more than a decade – plenty of time for employers to get on board and for authorities to enforce them.

And yet, while the federal law allows for fines against private sector employers who fail to comply with the three percent quota, no fines have ever been issued.

The result is, employment quotas are not being met, leaving hundreds of thousands of Iraqis with disabilities unemployed. Remember, too, Iraq has one of the largest populations of people with disabilities in the world.

In short, Iraqis with disabilities are willing and able to work. If only the authorities were as willing to do their job of enforcing the law.",HIGH,20240604T123000Z,Activist Muwafaq al-Khafaji,"Muwafaq al-Khafaji, Muhammed Ali al-Mayahi, Shaima",Iraqi authorities,"Baghdad, Iraq",Implement and enforce existing laws for employment rights of people with disabilities,Failure to uphold laws ensuring employment rights for people with disabilities,Iraq,Lack of enforcement of existing laws

Tantawy was detained inside the courthouse after the appeal decision was handed down.

The court also confirmed the decision to bar Tantawy from running in national elections for five years. On February 6, an Egyptian court sentenced Tantawy along with his campaign adviser, Mohammad Abu al-Dyar, and 21 of his detained supporters to one year in prison in relation to his peaceful campaign to collect public endorsements to run for president. Tantawy and his campaign adviser had been released on a bail of 20,000 Egyptian pounds (about US$648) during the appeal.

“Punishing Tantawy and his supporters for challenging president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi reveals once again the authorities’ zero tolerance toward peaceful activism,” said Adam Coogle, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “Egyptian authorities at the highest levels should immediately review the case against Tantawy and release him and his supporters.”

The authorities have not revealed Tantawy’s immediate whereabouts, a source with knowledge of the case told Human Rights Watch. The source said that on May 30, the family learned that he is in the 10th of Ramadan prison, in al-Sharqia governorate, east of Cairo. Abu al-Dyar, who was sentenced in absentia, had a retrial on June 3 and was arrested inside a courtroom on June 3 as judges confirmed his prison sentence.

The court ruling is entirely based on Tantawy's peaceful political activism and the efforts of Tantawy’s campaign to collect support statements before the December 2023 presidential election, in which president Sisi won a third six-year term with 89.6 percent of the noncompetitive vote. Tantawy and his supporters were charged with printing and distributing unofficial support statements. These charges stem from calls made on October 8 by Tantawy’s campaign urging supporters to complete unofficial endorsement forms online to prove the extent of Tantawy’s support across the country, which authorities then construed as an electoral offense.

Human Rights Watch documented dozens of unlawful arrests, intimidation, and prosecutions against potential candidates and their supporters before the election, all of which effectively prevented any meaningful competition. The Egyptian authorities detained and prosecuted dozens of family members as well as perceived or actual supporters of Tantawy starting in March 2023, after he announced that he planned to run for president.

Law No. 45 of 2014 on the Regulation of the Exercise of Political Rights provides for a minimum of one year in prison and/or a fine of 1,000 to 5,000 Egyptian pounds (about US$32 to $162) for “printing or distributing, in any way, election ballots or documents used in the electoral process” without authorization. Using this article to restrict the ability of activists to collect support statements or endorsements in the context of a political campaign is incompatible with the rights to freedom of expression and association under international human rights law, Human Rights Watch said.

All those arrested without credible evidence of a recognizable offense should be immediately and unconditionally released, Human Rights Watch said.

Across the Middle East and North Africa region, the criminalization of consensual same-sex relations and diverse gender expressions persists, subjecting people identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) to widespread human rights abuses. Within this landscape, some countries do not have explicit laws targeting people with diverse sexual orientations, but that does not mean that they are safe or equal.

The fight to abandon laws that criminalize same-sex relations and ensure equality for all may overlook other oppressive practices employed by states to “legally” harass and prosecute LGBT people. A complex legal dynamic between criminalization and decriminalization unfolds, particularly evident in the cases of Egypt, Jordan, and Kuwait.

Alternative legal avenues, such as laws pertaining to public morality and debauchery, serve as tools for authorities to persecute and intimidate LGBT people. In Egypt, while consensual same-sex relations are not explicitly criminalized, vaguely defined laws related to public morality provide a pretext for discriminatory treatment. Article 178 of the Egyptian penal code, for instance, sanctions the creation or promotion of material deemed contrary to public morals, enabling the unjust targeting of LGBT people.

In 2017, an Egyptian writer and activist, Sarah Hegazy, among others, was arrested after raising a rainbow flag at a concert in Cairo. Sarah was charged with inciting acts of debauchery and immorality and went to live in exile in Canada after being released. Sarah ended her life in 2020 after struggling with the mental and emotional impact of being abused in detention.

In Jordan, where consensual same-sex relations have been decriminalized since 1951, the absence of robust legal protections leaves LGBT people vulnerable to state-sanctioned discrimination. Security forces use ambiguous morality laws and digital targeting tactics to target and harass them.

Article 320 of Jordan’s penal code, which penalizes indecent acts in public spaces, offers leeway for subjective interpretations, while recent cybercrime legislation further encroaches on privacy and freedom of expression, creating another avenue for harassing or even prosecuting LGBT people. The law’s vague provisions around promoting and inciting prostitution and sexual behaviour, and inciting immorality, could be used to justify the prosecution of LGBT people in particular.

For example, security forces in Jordan entrapped a transgender woman in 2019, searched her phone, and based on her personal photos, detained her pretrial. After enduring eight court hearings, she was released on bail.

In Kuwait, article 198 of the penal code, which previously criminalized gender non-conformity, was overturned in February, 2020, initially signaling progress for transgender and non-binary rights. However, subsequent actions, such as mass deportations under the guise of “security” measures, underscore the ongoing threats to LGBT people. And provisions within Kuwait’s communications law, notably article 70, pose further threats to freedom of expression and privacy, potentially exacerbating the vulnerability of LGBT individuals.

Criminalization of same-sex relations remains a legal hurdle, not only to ensuring equal access to justice and treatment for everyone, but also in recognizing and respecting personal and sexual autonomy. The consequences of criminalization pose various challenges to guaranteeing universal human rights such as the right to freedom of expression and association for LGBT people, in addition to allowing for prejudice on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity and expression to continue.

On the other hand, as LGBT activists and human rights defenders call on countries to abolish the criminalization of same-sex relations and repeal laws that are inherently discriminatory and abusive, it is of great importance to recognize that decriminalization as a mere legal procedure, if not grounded in clear and substantive measures to protect and provide legal remedies to those affected, it can still leave LGBT people vulnerable to marginalization and prosecution.

While decriminalization represents a fundamental protection practice and a significant step toward affirming the rights of LGBT people, the mere absence of punitive laws is insufficient to ensure genuine equality and protection. Implementation gaps and the misuse of existing legal frameworks continue to leave people exposed to discrimination and violence. Affirmative laws explicitly safeguarding against such abuses are imperative to foster a society where LGBT people are treated as equal members.

Decriminalization of same-sex relations should include all the necessary legislative measures that not only prohibit bias and discrimination, but that guarantee accountability, justice, and protection from harmful and inhuman treatment.

True progress lies not only in decriminalization but in the establishment of comprehensive legal protections that safeguard the diversity of sexual orientations and gender identities and are grounded and guided by a genuine respect for human rights and dignity.

Houthi authorities appear to be arbitrarily detaining the individuals based on their employment. The Houthis, who control Sanaa, the capital of Yemen, as well as much of northern Yemen, have disappeared, arbitrarily detained, and tortured hundreds of civilians, including UN workers and workers for nongovernmental agencies, since the start of Yemen’s conflict in 2014.

Family members and colleagues of some of those detained told Human Rights Watch that Houthi authorities have not revealed the locations of the people they detained or allowed them to communicate with their employers or families. The authorities’ refusal to reveal the whereabouts or fate of detainees can amount to enforced disappearance under international law. In one case, the Houthis also detained the husband and two children, a 3-year-old and a 9-month-old, of a woman who works with a civil society organization in Yemen, according to a friend who spoke to Human Rights Watch.

The following quote can be attributed to Niku Jafarnia, Yemen and Bahrain researcher at Human Rights Watch:

“The Houthis should immediately release any UN employees and workers for other independent groups they have detained because of their human rights and humanitarian work and stop arbitrarily detaining and forcibly disappearing people. Such detentions not only attack the rights of these individuals but also undermine essential humanitarian and human rights work in Yemen at a time when the majority of Yemenis do not have adequate access to basic necessities like food and water.”

The Houthis also detained several people working with Yemeni civil society organizations over the last week. In October 2023, Hisham al-Hakimi, an employee of Save the Children, died in Houthi custody after being arbitrarily detained since September 9, 2023. Three UN staff have remained arbitrarily detained by the Houthis – one since November 2021 and two since August 2023.

Ninety-three member countries of the International Criminal Court (ICC) have declared their “unwavering support” for the court in the face of recent threats.

The June 14 statement by an unprecedented number of ICC members across the globe follows a slew of threats, particularly after ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan announced on May 20 that he was seeking arrest warrants against two senior Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, along with three Hamas leaders.

The joint statement reconfirmed ICC members’ support for the court “as an independent and impartial judicial institution” and their committment to defending the ICC, its officials, and those cooperating with it from any political interference and pressure. It follows similar expressions of support by the Presidency of the ICC Assembly of States Parties, several ICC member countries—including UN Security Council members—the high representative of the European Union, UN special procedures, and nongovernmental organizations.

In April, amid speculation ICC warrants for crimes committed in Gaza were imminent, 12 US senators threatened to sanction Khan should he pursue cases against top Israeli officials. Netanyahu also called on governments to prevent the court from issuing warrants. Khan’s office denounced the threats, noting that the ICC can also prosecute individuals for obstructing justice.

On June 4, after the warrant applications were announced, the US House of Representatives passed a bill aimed at imposing sanctions against the ICC, its officials, and those supporting investigations at the court involving US citizens or allies. The bill is now under consideration in the US Senate. The proposed law is reminiscent of the sanctions imposed by President Donald Trump on the previous ICC prosecutor to intimidate the court from pursuing cases against US and Israeli personnel for crimes committed in Afghanistan and Palestine. President Joe Biden revoked those sanctions in 2021 and has so far opposed the current bill.

The ICC is also in Russia’s crosshairs. In 2023, Russian authorities issued arrest warrants against Khan and six ICC judges after the ICC issued an arrest warrant against Russian President Vladimir Putin and another Russian official for war crimes committed in Ukraine. Russian lawmakers also enacted a law criminalizing cooperation with the ICC.

In both the Palestine and Ukraine investigations, ICC officials are simply doing their job.

(New York) – Chinese authorities in Xinjiang have been systematically changing hundreds of village names with religious, historical, or cultural meaning for Uyghurs into names reflecting recent Chinese Communist Party ideology, Human Rights Watch said today.

Human Rights Watch research has identified about 630 villages where the names have been changed that way. The top three most common replacement village names are “Happiness,” “Unity,” and “Harmony.”

“The Chinese authorities have been changing hundreds of village names in Xinjiang from those rich in meaning for Uyghurs to those that reflect government propaganda,” said Maya Wang, acting China director at Human Rights Watch. “These name changes appear part of Chinese government efforts to erase the cultural and religious expressions of Uyghurs.”

In joint research, Human Rights Watch and Norway-based organization Uyghur Hjelp (“Uyghur help”) scraped names of villages in Xinjiang from the website of the National Bureau of Statistics of China between 2009 and 2023.

The names of about 3,600 of the 25,000 villages in Xinjiang were changed during this period. About four-fifths of these changes appear mundane, such as number changes, or corrections to names previously written incorrectly. But the 630, about a fifth, involve changes of a religious, cultural, or historical nature.

The changes fall into three broad categories. Any mentions of religion, including Islamic terms, such as Hoja (霍加), a title for a Sufi religious teacher, and haniqa (哈尼喀), a type of Sufi religious building, have been removed, along with mentions of shamanism, such as baxshi (巴合希), a shaman.

Any mentions of Uyghur history, including the names of its kingdoms, republics, and local leaders prior to the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, and words such as orda (欧尔达), which means “palace,” sultan (苏里坦), and beg (博克), which are political or honorific titles, have also been changed. The authorities also removed terms in village names that denote Uyghur cultural practices, such as mazar (麻扎), shrine, and dutar (都塔尔), a two-stringed lute at the heart of Uyghur musical culture.

While the renaming of villages appears ongoing, most of these changes occurred between 2017 and 2019, when the Chinese government’s crimes against humanity escalated in the region, and mostly in Kashgar, Aksu, and Hotan prefectures, Uyghur majority regions in southern Xinjiang.

Because of a lack of access to Xinjiang, the full impact of the village name changes on people’s lives is unclear. Uyghur Hjelp interviewed 11 Uyghurs who lived in villages whose names had been changed, and found that the experience had a deep impact on them. One villager faced difficulties going home after being released from a re-education camp because the ticketing system no longer included the name she knew. She later faced more difficulties registering for government services due to the change. Another villager said he wrote a poem and commissioned a song to commemorate all the lost locations around where he had lived.

Article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which China has signed but not ratified, states that, “In those States in which ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities exist, persons belonging to such minorities shall not be denied the right, in community with the other members of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practice their own religion, or to use their own language.”

The United Nations Human Rights Committee, the independent expert body that interprets the covenant, has stated in a General Comment that, “[t]he protection of these rights is directed towards ensuring the survival and continued development of the cultural, religious and social identity of the minorities concerned, thus enriching the fabric of society as a whole…. [T]hese rights must be protected as such.”

In May 2014, the Chinese government launched the “Strike Hard Campaign against Violent Terrorism” in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Since 2017, the Chinese government has carried out a widespread and systematic attack against Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang. It includes mass arbitrary detention, torture, enforced disappearances, mass surveillance, cultural and religious persecution, separation of families, forced labor, sexual violence, and violations of reproductive rights. Human Rights Watch in 2021 concluded that these violations constituted crimes against humanity.

The Chinese government has continued to conflate Uyghurs’ everyday religious and cultural practices, and their expressions of identity, with violent extremism to justify violations against them. In April 2017, the Chinese government promulgated the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Regulation on De-extremification, which prohibits “the propagation of religious fervor with abnormal ... names.” Authorities reportedly banned dozens of personal names with religious connotations common to Muslims around the world, such as Saddam and Medina, on the basis that they could “exaggerate religious fervor.”

In August 2022, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) issued a report concluding that Chinese government abuses in Xinjiang “may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity.” While foreign governments have condemned Beijing’s policies in Xinjiang, and some have imposed targeted and other sanctions on Chinese government officials, agencies, and companies implicated in rights violations, these responses have fallen short of the gravity of Beijing’s abuses, Human Rights Watch said.

“Concerned governments and the UN human rights office should intensify their efforts to hold the Chinese government accountable for their abuses in the Uyghur region,” said Abduweli Ayub, founder of Uyghur Hjelp, “They should make use of the upcoming UN Human Rights Council sessions and all high-level bilateral meetings to press Beijing to free the hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs still wrongfully imprisoned as part of its abusive Strike Hard Campaign.”

Examples of Village Name Changes

In Kashgar Prefecture, Qutpidin Mazar village (库普丁麻扎村), named after a shrine of the 13th century Persian polymath and poet, Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi, was renamed Rose Flower village (玫瑰花村) in 2018;

In Akto County, Kizilsu Kyrgyz Autonomous Prefecture, Aq Meschit (“white mosque”) village (阿克美其特村) was renamed Unity village (团结村) in 2018;

In Aksu Prefecture, Hoja Eriq (“Sufi teacher’s creek”) village (霍加艾日克村), was renamed Willow village (柳树村) in 2018;

In Karakax County, Dutar village (都塔尔村), named after a Uyghur musical instrument, was renamed Red Flag village (红旗村) in 2022.

A full list of these village names is available upon request.

Methodology

The National Bureau of Statistics of China publishes a list of “Administrative Division Codes for Statistics,” (统计用区划代码) in which each village is represented by a 12-digit code. These digits identify villages by the five administrative levels of China: province, city/prefecture, county, township, and village. In total, we were able to identify 25,394 unique Administrative Division Codes in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) between 2009 and 2023 (the exact number fluctuates each year). Of these, 23,291 are villages.

To simplify the process of identifying those villages with changed names, we first removed the suffixes of the village names that simply denote “village,” given that they may appear in different variations, such as “农业村” (farming village) and “牧业村” (herding village).

We found 3,652 village names that had been changed between 2009 to 2023. About 1,254 of them involve name changes in Mandarin Chinese (the village names changed, but both the name before and the one after are in Mandarin Chinese). The bulk of Chinese-to-Chinese name changes involve mundane changes such as from “First Company” to “Third Company” of the Sixth Division of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps.

Since the Uyghur language does not have a standard transliteration scheme to Mandarin Chinese, many villages use different Chinese transliteration from year to year. Human Rights Watch used “edit distance” – an algorithm that computes the similarities between names before and after the change – and removed the ones that are different Chinese transliterations of the same Uyghur name.

The remaining name changes – about 1,000 – mostly involve changes from Uyghur to Chinese, though in some cases, both the before and after names are both in Uyghur, and a few changed from Mandarin Chinese to Uyghur. Among these 1,000, about 350 involve similarly benign changes, such as from Qumchi Östeng (“sandy canal”) village to Jigdelik (“a place with date trees”) village.

But about 630 of the name changes involve changes that remove a religious, historical, or Uyghur cultural term and replaces it with a name that is generic or one that fits the Chinese Communist Party’s ideology.

Analysis of Data

Certain words are more likely to be removed from a village name. In 2009, there were 47 villages in Xinjiang with the word “mazar” (shrine) in their names; all but 6 villages have removed the word from their names. “Hoja” (religious teacher) appeared in the names of 28 villages in 2016, but only 3 remained by 2023. Ten of thirteen villages in Xinjiang that had the word “haniqa” in them, which means a Sufi meeting house, had renamed them. There are now no more villages with the word “xelpe” or “khalifa” (ruler) in their names.

(Nairobi) – Sudan’s warring parties’ recent unlawful attacks in North Darfur’s El Fasher have killed hundreds of civilians and forced tens of thousands to flee, as thousands in and around the city face starvation, Human Rights Watch said today. The United Nations secretary-general should act on the UN Security Council’s resolution 2736 and urgently work with the African Union (AU) to deploy a civilian protection mission. Governments should support the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor’s investigation into apparent war crimes and other atrocities in Darfur.

“Since mid-May, Sudan’s warring parties have pounded populated areas of El Fasher with no apparent regard for the civilians there, while the Rapid Support Forces are burning down residential areas and deliberately targeting hospitals,” said Mohamed Osman, researcher for the Africa division at Human Rights Watch. “The UN and AU urgently need to act to protect civilians.”

Clashes in El Fasher between the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and their allied militias against Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and their allied joint forces escalated in mid-May. Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors without Borders, MSF) said that the South Hospital, the city’s only critical care facility, and subsequently the Saudi hospital received 1,418 wounded between May 10 and June 11, 2024; 226 of whom died. Many others could not reach the hospitals.

On June 8, Rapid Support Forces attacked South Hospital. Fighters entered the hospital shooting, forcing patients, their relatives, and medical staff to flee. A Health Ministry official said the RSF beat him and two other doctors. The forces also looted medical supplies and equipment. The hospital was forced to close.

Videos posted to Telegram on June 9 for which Human Rights Watch identified the location, show RSF fighters inside the hospital compound. In one, an RSF fighter sits in an ambulance by the entrance. Attacks directed at a medical facility, which is a civilian target, constitute a war crime.

The South Hospital had been hit at least four times by explosive weapons from May 25 to June 3, killing a total of 2 patients and wounding 14. Médecins Sans Frontières reported that a mortar shell landed in the antenatal care unit on May 25. It said that a shell landed in another part of the hospital on May 26,also damaging the hospital and the ambulance. Satellite imagery from the next day shows an impact crater consistent with indirect fire, such as mortars or artillery, inside the compound. On May 31, shelling impacted the south wall of hospital compound, no casualties were reported. Médecins Sans Frontières said that on June 3, shelling and shooting killed one patient and wounded another, and damaged the hospital’s water tank.

Both warring parties have engaged in heavy fighting in and around the Abu Shouk internally displaced people’s camp in northwestern El Fasher. Based on videos uploaded to X, Human Rights Watch verified the presence of RSF forces on the eastern edge of Abu Shouk camp as early as May 22.

On June 8, following fighting in its vicinity, at least one mortar projectile and two other explosive weapons hit an emergency clinic run by volunteers in the southern part of Abu Shouk, a witness said. The attack injured four or five people inside, including volunteer health workers and a child of one volunteer. Three people said the projectiles came from the east, where the RSF are based. Human Rights Watch was not able to confirm the direction.

A video analyzed and geolocated by Human Rights Watch show the stabilization fins of a mortar projectile in the clinic wall, and damage to its walls and corrugated iron roof.

Videos posted on June 9 on the Facebook page of the Abu Shouk Emergency Room show injured children, including reportedly injured from shelling and clashes on June 8.

Following heavy clashes on May 22 between the RSF and joint forces, a local responder said that the RSF shelled the camp and its surrounding areas, and rounded-up and beat youth. Satellite imagery from May 23 shows new burned houses southwest of Abu Shouk camp. A verified video uploaded to X on May 23 shows houses in that area engulfed in flames. A voice says: “Today’s shelling by the RSF forces in the Abu Shouk camp. At least 10 artillery shells today.”

Human Rights Watch’s analysis of satellite imagery shows an increase in graves in at least six cemeteries in the city from May 9 to June 12, notably in Abu Shouk camp, and in the area to the southwest that came under attack on May 22.

Thousands of houses have been destroyed by fire, notably by arson, since the fighting began in April, notably in the eastern part of the city in residential areas with traditional housing. In May, Human Rights Watch geolocated videos posted online that show RSF soldiers close to residential areas ablaze. The use of arson is consistent with the RSF and allied militias’ attacks in West Darfur state in 2023. As of June 12, 43 villages near El Fasher have been reportedly affected by fire.

Both forces have used explosive weapons with wide-area effects – including mortars, artillery rockets, and air-delivered munitions in the case of the military – in populated areas across the country. Use of these weapons can frequently result in indiscriminate attacks that violate the laws of war.

Two videos geolocated by Human Rights Watch show RSF soldiers using a 9M133 Kornet portable anti-tank guided missile. In one, the missile is fired from a hill east of El Fasher, toward the city. In the second, the missile is fired from a pick-up truck inside residential areas in the eastern part of the city.

A video shared on social media on June 16, verified and geolocated, shows Grad-type artillery rockets hitting neighborhoods in central El Fasher around the Grand Market and the Grand Mosque. Satellite imagery and shadows analysis show that the attacks occurred on the afternoon of June 3. Analysis of the video shows that the rockets were fired from north and northeast of the city, where RSF artillery positions are based.

On June 11, social media reported heavy shelling in Tambasi neighborhood, killing several civilians, including reportedly eight volunteers in a soup kitchen, south of Baraka square. “I saw the smoke, people screaming and running, another shelling also happened in this Baraka square,” a witness said. “These young people were providing food to the IDP gathering sites in this area.”

At the end of May, the UN reported that fighting left parts of the city without electricity and water, a trend documented in Khartoum and elsewhere.

One video uploaded to X on May 26, shows an RSF commander and several fighters shutting off water pumping stations for El Fasher at Golo reservoir, east of the city. Human Rights Watch verified several photos and a video showing the military recapturing the station a few days later, claiming to restart the pump. Human Rights Watch was unable to confirm whether the pump was restarted, and the extent to which this reservoir supplied water to the city.

Human Rights Watch received reports that civilians fleeing toward Mellit, 60 kilometers north, through an area under RSF and its allies’ control, were stopped, searched, and on June 3, killed at the last checkpoint before Mellit town.

A UN refugee agency official said on June 11 that violence has displaced 150,000 people in and around El Fasher in the past two months. Since late May, many civilians have fled south toward the Zamzam camp for internally displaced people, or towards Tawila, controlled by the Sudan Liberation Army, Abdul Wahid forces, a Darfuri armed group.

On May 28, Darfur Governor Minni Minnawi, the leader of the Sudanese Liberation Army, part of the joint forces supporting the military, said that El Fasher residents should take arms to defend their “honor and property.” Media have reported an uptick in civilians arming themselves, fighting with the joint forces and popular self-defense groups.

The fighting has added to an already catastrophic humanitarian situation in the town, particularly for those already displaced. Media reported on June 13 that a preliminary analysis by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) projected that 15 percent of the population of El Fasher and Zamzam camp would face catastrophic food shortages by September, and that many could die of hunger.

In a May 21 resolution, the African Union Peace and Security Council said the AU High Level Panel on Sudan should work with the newly appointed AU special envoy for the prevention of genocide on a plan to protect civilians. On June 13, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution on El Fasher asking the secretary-general to make recommendations for the protection of Sudan’s civilians.

Both resolutions are long-awaited steps in the right direction, and now is the time to lay out a workable vision for a protection mission and deploy it, Human Rights Watch said. The UN Security Council should also act on findings of the UN Panel of Experts on Darfur, including on violations of the UN arms embargo by other countries, notably the United Arab Emirates.

On June 12, the ICC prosecutor called for cooperation and information on alleged international crimes in Darfur, including El Fasher. ICC member countries should provide the court with timely information, support arrest efforts, and ensure the court has the budget to deliver justice in Darfur as well as the other situations on the court’s docket.

At 8 a.m. on February 24, 2022, columns of Russian troops seized the periphery road around Kharkiv, the capital and largest city in Ukraine’s Kharkivska region. Russian forces never captured the city, but for the next six months they controlled a third of the vast region, some 8,500 square kilometers, where 260,000 students had been enrolled in primary and secondary schools. During that time, the occupying authorities worked to replace Ukraine’s education system with Russia’s, teaching the Russian official curriculum, in the Russian language. About 223,000 students remained after Ukrainian forces re-took much of the area in September and October 2022.

Russian forces have also occupied areas of the Khersonska, Zaporizka, Donetska and Luhanska regions of Ukraine. Russia has imposed its education system wholesale and banned Ukrainian education in occupied Ukrainian territory, in violation of international law—both the laws of armed conflict and international human rights law.

This report documents violations by the Russian occupying authorities in relation to education, both in formerly occupied areas of the Kharkivska region, and in areas of Khersonska, Zaporizka, Donetska and Luhanska regions that remain under Russian occupation. Human Rights Watch documented violations through research in Kharkivska region after it was de-occupied by Ukrainian forces in September 2022, and through interviews with teachers who had been displaced or escaped from areas currently under occupation. In total, Ukrainian experts estimate that one million school-age Ukrainian children are in Russian-occupied territory, 458,000 in Crimea alone. Data that the Ukrainian Ministry of Education and Science provided Human Rights Watch indicate that more than 62,400 children living in occupied areas continue to study in Ukrainian secondary education institutions remotely.

The report also documents the Ukrainian authorities’ problematic use of the offence of collaboration against Ukrainian education staff who worked under Russian occupation. The report examines the manner in which the Ukrainian government has used compulsory security screening known as “filtration,” as well as criminal prosecution and administrative sanctions against suspected collaborators.

Finally, the report addresses some of the other pressures that Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has placed on the education system, such as barriers to online learning, the burgeoning need for mental health support for students and teachers, and the impact on students with disabilities.

Violations by Russian Authorities in Relation to Education

Russian occupying forces in Ukraine and federal authorities, including Russia’s education minister and other senior officials, have taken measures to suppress the Ukrainian language and curriculum and impose the Russian curriculum and Russian as the language of instruction in schools. These measures violate the laws of armed conflict, which prohibit an occupying power from making unnecessary changes to laws in the occupied territory, such as Ukraine’s 2017 Law on Education.

Ukrainian children under occupation are indoctrinated with the Kremlin’s anti-Ukrainian propaganda. They also receive military training as part of the school curriculum. The Russian school curriculum, which includes history textbooks that seek to justify Russia’s invasion and portrays Ukraine under its current government as a “neo-Nazi state,” and which strictly limits instruction in the Ukrainian language, also violates Ukrainian children’s right to an education that develops respect for the child’s “own cultural identity, language and values,” as well as the “national values” of the child’s country of origin. Russia’s imposition of Russian education in the Russian language in occupied Ukrainian territory violates international human rights standards including the prohibition against propaganda for war, the child’s right to education in their mother-tongue , and parents’ right of choice regarding their children’s education. As the UN human rights office reported, the Russian authorities require secondary schools in occupied Ukrainian territory to report the names of students ages 18 and older, whom the Russian authorities deem eligible to be drafted into the Russian armed forces.

Any criticism of the invasion in schools is subject to retaliation by occupying authorities. Russian proxies in occupied Melitopol punished a student who spoke Ukrainian in school by driving him dozens of kilometers with a bag over his head to a remote area and abandoning him to walk back home alone. Occupying authorities threatened parents with fines, loss of custody of their children, and detention if they did not enroll their children in “Russian” schools or if their children studied the Ukrainian curriculum remotely. Some parents reportedly hid their children as a result.

While occupying authorities punished distance learning or teaching of the Ukrainian curriculum, teachers and parents described Russified schools as having very limited classes and hours of instruction, insufficient staff, and often no electricity. Some Ukrainian children from territories that Russia has occupied since its initial 2014 invasion of Ukraine have studied only under the Russian system and will need additional support to integrate and thrive in the Ukrainian system, according to Ukrainian civil society groups supporting education.

In Kharkivska region, where about 15,000 of the region’s 80,000 teachers were under occupation between March and September 2022, Russian occupying authorities used coercion, detention, ill-treatment, beatings, and electroshock torture to pressure Ukrainian teachers to work or to hand over students’ files and other school data. Occupying authorities continue to pressure Ukrainian teachers and parents elsewhere.

Ukrainian Use of Security Screening, Criminal Prosecution and Administrative Sanctions Against Suspected Collaborators

Following the Ukrainian army’s de-occupation of some of the occupied territories, the Ukrainian authorities accused some education staff of collaboration with the Russian occupying authorities and subjected them to a form of compulsory security screening known as “filtration,” as well as criminal prosecution and administrative sanctions by Ukrainian authorities.

On September 20, 2022, the Ministry of Education and Science issued guidance that teachers who collaborated should be fired, but without clearly specifying the acts or intentions that should be punished, Human Rights Watch found. Teachers’ salaries were often delayed as a result of screening and verification processes intended to prevent people suspected as collaborators from receiving payment.

The laws of war do not directly address wartime collaboration, but they prohibit occupying forces from exercising coercion against civilians who are not their own nationals, anticipating occupying forces’ efforts to do so. They also require the occupying power to facilitate the proper working of institutions dedicated to the education of children, with the cooperation of the national and local authorities. Given the context of occupation and responsibilities of teachers to the education of children, Human Rights Watch believes Ukrainian authorities should not penalize teachers in occupied territories solely for providing education to children under the Russian curriculum. Human Rights Watch notes that some of the subjects under the Russian curriculum, such as math and sciences, have no ideological component.

Ukrainian civil society groups, teachers, and the Ukrainian Education Ombudsperson have criticized Ukraine’s 2022 anti-collaboration law for being unclear as to which acts are criminalized, and for not clarifying whether actions are criminal if they were coerced or otherwise did not reflect an intention to support Russia’s occupation. Across Ukraine, from March 2022, when the law was adopted, to July 2023, just nine education staff were prosecuted for collaboration, mostly administrators who worked with the occupying authorities. However, in one case, for example, a group of teachers in Kharkivska region vigorously defended a colleague who was subjected to “filtration” and detained for three weeks by the Security Service of Ukraine before being released, arguing that his engagement with occupying authorities was motivated solely by the need to protect the teaching staff and the school.

Charges of collaboration should only be considered for those against whom there is evidence of aggravating actions constituting willful collaboration in a way that threatens Ukraine’s security. In any case, international law requires that authorities ensure due process and fair trial rights in any criminal procedure, including due consideration to the defense of duress or coercive circumstances, and that any penalty must be proportionate. The authorities should review the broadly phrased definition of collaboration under the law and relevant sanctions to ensure the necessary human rights and due process safeguards are upheld.

Challenges to Educational Recovery in Liberated Territories

The Kharkivska military administration, which the Ukrainian government established as an emergency measure after the full-scale invasion, suspended in-person education in schools as a security measure against continuing Russian attacks after February 2022. Yet Russian attacks on critical infrastructure, which destroyed or disabled electricity, phone and internet networks, made distance learning difficult or impossible to access for many children and teachers.

Children with disabilities were often unable to evacuate from areas that fell under occupation and were especially affected by the suspension of in-person education. In July 2023, the Kharkivska military administration decided to allow schools to re-open if they have bomb shelters that met government regulations.

Outside cities, students and teachers who experienced potentially traumatic events in many communities that fell under occupation have had virtually no access to mental health and psychosocial support. Ukraine is ramping up efforts to train 15,000 school psychologists to support students nationwide.

The full-scale invasion has put Ukraine’s education system under enormous strain. Since then, Ukrainian national and local education authorities, with support from Ukrainian civil society and international donors, have taken innovative steps to provide education. These include efforts to ensure that online education with the Ukrainian state curriculum is available in Russia-occupied areas, such as extending a fully online “All-Ukrainian School,” first established during the coronavirus pandemic, which now offers 10,000 video lessons covering the curriculum from grades 5 through 11. Schools have shown flexibility in enrolling displaced students and students who had lived under occupation for a time, even if they did not have the correct school records or were behind or out of sync in terms of curricula, but vast needs remain.

The Ukrainian authorities and foreign donors should continue to coordinate with Ukrainian civil society groups to find ways to keep children connected to learning under occupation or during displacement by Russian forces, and to help bring them back into the national education system as soon as possible.





Recommendations

To the Government of the Russian Federation:

Respect obligations under international humanitarian law as an occupying power and: Immediately cease attempts to Russify the education system and carry out political indoctrination in occupied territories of Ukraine; Facilitate the education of children in occupied territories fully in line with Ukrainian curricula and Ukrainian law; Ensure that education staff in occupied territories of Ukraine can exercise their duties and students can follow the Ukrainian curriculum, and hold to account occupation officials responsible for harassing, ill-treating, and putting undue pressure on Ukrainian education workers, students and parents.



To the Ukrainian Justice Ministry, Office of the Prosecutor General, Ministry of Education and Science, Ukrainian Parliament:

Do not penalize teachers simply for providing education to children under the Russian curriculum in occupied territories;

Consider revisions to the legislation on collaboration to clarify, as appropriate, that merely undertaking work in the education sphere will not be punished;

Ensure that policies, measures and laws on collaboration, filtration processes, and administrative penalties like termination of employment and professional bans are implemented consistently with Ukraine’s human rights obligations, including due process and fair trials, and relevant norms on occupation under international humanitarian law.

To the Ukrainian Ministry of Education and Science, regional military administration officials, and international donors:

In consultation with Ukrainian and international civil society groups, teachers’ unions, and humanitarian agencies: Support the safe and accessible reconstruction of schools damaged or destroyed during hostilities; Support students and teachers from educational facilities that were evacuated, damaged, or destroyed, to continue or re-enter learning and teaching; Develop programs to support families who are providing education to their children at home, often with minimal connectivity and technical capacities, particularly in previously occupied areas where devices may have been confiscated during occupation; Develop programs to support children who were educated under Russian occupying authorities to transition successfully to the Ukrainian school system; Expand support for education for children with disabilities who cannot be reached with distance learning; Continue to expand the roll-out of mental health and psychosocial support programs for students and teachers, while developing an evidence-based toolkit for school psychologists; Develop methods to enable teachers displaced from occupied territory to receive their salaries more promptly, or to find work at new schools.







Methodology

Human Rights Watch visited seven communities in Kharkivska region in November 2022, less than two months after Ukrainian forces de-occupied them, and interviewed 42 Ukrainian education officials, teachers, teachers’ union representatives, and other school staff there, as well as Ukraine’s Ombudsperson for Education, and a district military administration’s head. Having no access to the areas still under occupation, we later interviewed by phone or in person four teachers and other education staff from occupied areas—in Mariupol, as well as in Zaporizka, Khersonska and Luhanska regions—who had evacuated to Ukrainian-controlled areas. We also interviewed staff from four Ukrainian civil society groups and three international humanitarian agencies specialized in education or mental health.

Our research included reviewing Russian history textbooks left behind in Ukrainian schools in 2022, as well as textbooks intended for use in the 2023-24 school year, and the new Russian secondary school history textbook launched in autumn 2023 in Russia and in Russia-occupied areas of Ukraine. We reviewed Ukrainian and Russian laws in the sphere of education, newspapers published by occupying authorities, publications in Russian government or pro-Kremlin media, and reports from UN and other humanitarian agencies and local and international news media. We sent letters to the Ukrainian government as well as the Russian government with our preliminary findings and questions. The Russian authorities did not reply. The Ukrainian authorities provided a written reply on June 12 and at time of writing, we are in dialogue with them regarding our research findings. The scope of this research is limited to primary and secondary schools, including vocational schools, and does not extend to either pre-primary or higher education.





I. Russia’s Unlawful Changes to Education in Occupied Ukrainian Territory

Russia’s education policies in occupied Ukrainian territory violate its obligations under the laws of war and human rights law. An occupying power is required to restore public order and services in the occupied territory, and in particular to facilitate the proper working of institutions dedicated to the education of children, but it must respect the laws in force in the territory before the occupation and is prohibited from imposing its own laws, including laws on education. Russia’s human rights obligations also extend to occupied territory, including the prohibition against propaganda for war in education and the denial of education in a child’s own language.

Russia’s Unlawful Takeover of Education in Occupied Ukrainian Territory

Russian authorities seek to impose complete control over education policies and schools in occupied areas in Ukraine, as if they were in Russian territory, contrary to the law of occupation. Russian occupying authorities also restrict access to education to Ukrainian students unless they submit to the annexationist policy of pressuring Ukrainians to obtain Russian passports.

In the Khersonska region, the occupying authority’s head of education, Mikhail Rodikov, stated on September 1, 2022 that students would “become educated … citizens of their country, Russia,” and the de facto authorities praised education “under the Russian flag.”

Occupying authorities have beaten school children who expressed peaceful opposition to the occupation. In Melitopol, Hanna Bout, a teacher at the Professional Agricultural Lyceum who was an awardee as one the best teachers in Ukraine in 2021, said, “They changed the flags to Russia’s on February 25 [2022]. We protested against the occupation until March 18, when they beat demonstrators harshly. They beat a girl under 18 and broke her ribs for having a Ukrainian flag painted on her cheek.” Bout later escaped to western Ukraine.

Russia requires Ukrainians living in occupied territory to acquire Russian passports by July 1, 2024, or else they will be considered foreign nationals, contrary to the international law prohibition on forcing inhabitants of occupied territory to swear allegiance to the hostile power. Some schools in occupied Ukrainian territory have reportedly sent messages to parents that a copy of at least one parent’s Russian passport is required for their child to enroll. Similar restrictions have been documented in areas of the Donetska and Luhanska regions of Ukraine occupied by Russian forces since 2014, where local de facto authorities have required families to obtain Russian passports or passports issued by the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) and Luhansk People’s Republic (LNR) as a condition of access to education.

Even before the sham referendums on annexation that were held in late September 2022, representatives of the so-called DNR and LNR participated in a conference of Russia’s regional education ministers in Russia in May 2022.

By the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Russian school-oversight agency (Rosobrnadzor) had accredited 40 schools, colleges, and universities in the so-called DNR and LNR, which use the Russian curriculum and Russian as the language of instruction. From February to July 2022, the agency accredited an additional seven schools and a college in newly occupied areas of Ukraine.

In at least one district of Kharkiv region, teachers in 2022 signed employment contracts not with the local occupying authorities, but directly with a department of the Russian federal government, although it is not clear whether this has been the arrangement in all occupied areas at all times. The occupying authorities’ imposition of the Russian education system included prohibiting the Ukrainian curriculum and requiring Ukrainian teachers to be re-certified to teach the Russian curriculum through training in Russia or in occupied Crimea. In Borova, local occupying authorities told teachers that travel arrangements would be made for them to receive accreditation in occupied Crimea or Russia’s Belgorod region, but ultimately this did not happen due to “constant hostilities,” teachers said. In Shevchenkove, “a busload of teachers” went to Russia for recertification courses, which others refused despite pressure from “the so-called ‘acting school director.’” Re-certification of teachers from Mariupol who agreed to teach under occupying authorities was organized in St. Petersburg, a teacher said. In Kherson, the occupying authorities announced in June 2022 that school directors and teachers would travel to Crimea for re-training under the Russian curriculum and several local schools received Russian accreditation before de-occupation of the city in autumn 2022.

In total, 1,300 schools were opened under the Russian system in Ukraine in 2022, according to Russia’s education minister Sergei Kravtsov. In December 2022, Kravtsov said 36,000 teachers were working in Russian-run schools.

Beginning in April 2022, the occupying authorities in Kharkivska region held meetings to recruit Ukrainian teachers, where they described their educational plans, and portrayed the switch to the Russian curriculum and other changes as inevitable. At a meeting in Borova, “they said if they didn’t get enough [Ukrainian] teachers [to agree], they would bring teachers from Russia,” and that “Russia is going to be here for a long time,” teachers recalled. Only “four or five” out of dozens of teachers agreed to teach under the Russian system, but the occupying authorities later brought another 15 teachers from the Donbas region, teachers said. In Shevchenkove, the occupying authorities said “that if local teachers refused to work, well, Russia is big, they will bring new teachers,” recalled education staff. The education staff who spoke to Human Rights Watch attended the meetings to learn about the occupying authorities’ plans, but all refused to teach.

In December 2022, Russia’s then-deputy minister of science and higher education, Grigory Gurov, said at a youth scientists’ congress that over 6000 teachers in the annexed territories of Ukraine had been re-certified to teach the official Russian curriculum. In February 2023, the Russian state education watchdog, Rosobrnadzor, stated that educational facilities in in the four so-called “new Russian regions” (i.e., in the occupied territories of Ukraine) were being issued temporary licenses allowing them to operate as part of Russia’s education system for another two years. In November 2023, the deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, said at a meeting with a leading Kremlin-sponsored youth organization that educational institutions in the annexed territories should be staffed with Russian “patriots.” In January 2024, Russia’s minister of education reported to President Putin that the integration of schools in the four so-called “new Russian regions” (i.e., in the occupied territories of Ukraine) into Russia’s education system should be completed within two years.

Propaganda for War and Military Training in Russian-Controlled Ukrainian Schools

Russian authorities have introduced textbooks and lessons in schools in occupied areas of Ukraine that falsify history to justify Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the authorities have also introduced military training, and require secondary schools to send them lists of students aged 18 and older who are eligible for conscription into the Russian armed forces. International law prohibits propaganda for war in education and pressure to enlist the occupied population into the occupying army.

In 2022, schools in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, including those Human Rights Watch visited in Kharkivska, received the same history, mathematics, and other textbooks that were taught in Russia. In the 2023-24 school year, schools in Russian-occupied areas, like schools in Russia, are using a new 11 grade history textbook, covering the years from 1945 to the present. Launched by the Russian education ministry, the textbook claims that Ukrainian statehood and language do not exist and includes maps that misrepresent parts of Ukraine as though they were part of Russia, following the sham annexations of these regions.

The textbook severely distorts the popular “Maidan” uprising against then-president Yanukovich’s rejection of a political and trade agreement with the European Union, followed by deadly repression of protesters, and Russia’s subsequent invasion of Ukraine and occupation of the Crimea and parts of the Donbas in 2014. The uprising led to an overhaul of Ukraine’s political system after Yanukovich fled to Russia. The textbook falsely claims “Ukrainian nationalists with direct support of the West” staged “a bloody military coup” to overthrow the government. It repeats a fabricated narrative that Ukrainian authorities launched a violent crackdown on citizens opposed to the new government, and Russian speakers in Ukraine in general, and designated residents of Donbass who did not renounce their Russian identity as “terrorists.” The textbook further falsely claims that this is what led to the war in the east of the country and the emergence of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) and Luhansk People’s Republic (LNR) whose “independence” Russia recognized in 2020, before unlawfully incorporating them in 2022. It also falsely claims that “practically the entire population of Crimea” wanted to be “reunited” with Russia and wholeheartedly welcomed the annexation.

Its final chapter addresses the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, calling it a “Special Military Operation,” as the Russian government does not acknowledge it as a war. It includes sections with such titles as “Ukrainian neo-Nazism,” “The return of Crimea [to Russia],”

and “Ukraine, a neo-Nazi state.” The textbook includes the Kremlin’s propaganda about the full-scale invasion of 2022 as necessary to protect “Russian civilization” from destruction by Kyiv and NATO and prevent a tragedy similar in scope to the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union.

The authors falsely claim that Russian forces do their utmost of protect civilians and do not under any circumstances attack “residential areas” while alleging that Ukrainian forces routinely use “their own citizens… as a human shield.”

Detailed reports by Human Rights Watch, the United Nations, and reputable international think-tanks refute these claims. Russia initially denied but later acknowledged its invasion of Ukraine in 2014, which independent analysts have found used false claims of Ukrainian repression of Russian-speaking citizens as a pretext. Russia's occupation of Crimea involved the persecution of Crimean Tatars and pro-Ukraine activists, the harassment and failure to stem abuses against these groups by pro-Russian paramilitary forces, and other abuses. Russia’s so-called annexation of areas of Ukraine is void under international law and involved coercion of the occupied population by Russian and proxy forces to vote. Human Rights Watch and other groups have documented scores of Russian attacks, such as attacks on aid convoys and on fleeing civilians, indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks, and attacks using cluster munitions on populated areas.

In the 2024-25 school year, Russia’s education ministry will also introduce compulsory lessons for 15- to 18-year-olds in occupied Ukrainian territories and in Russia, “Fundamentals of Security and Defense of the Motherland,” using another new textbook that includes false claims, such as that after 2014 ""Russian books were burned” in Ukraine, “the Russian language [was] banned... [and] 'Russian blood' cocktails were served in restaurants,” the BBC reported. These distorted narratives are consistent with the disinformation that Russian authorities have presented to the Russian public about Ukraine’s education system. A March 2022 news conference organized by Russia’s education ministry and the ruling United Russia Party, for instance, alleged that Ukrainian textbooks teach “Russophobia” and display a “Nazi approach to history and education,” claims that Russia’s education minister, Sergei Kravtsov, repeated in December 2022.

In occupied territories, for instance, in Mariupol, Vladimir Putin’s portraits, his “patriotic” quotes, and portraits of Russian “heroes of the Special Military Operation” have been exhibited in schools, where children are required to sing Russia’s national anthem. Occupation school officials have instructed Ukrainian children to write letters of support and admiration to Russian soldiers, who occupy parts of their country, according to Ukrainian government as well as reports by international and Ukrainian media.

Ukrainian children in areas under Russian occupation have received military training in schools. A teacher who escaped from occupied Mariupol in 2022 and remains in contact with former students said that occupying authorities had pressured them to enroll in Mariupol’s School No. 41, which taught a “paramilitary classes” including the use of different types of weapons. During the 2023-24 school year, secondary schools in Russian occupied Ukraine have reportedly trained male students in in the use of assault rifles and hand grenades. Schools and summer camps also subjected children as young as six, including girls, to military training and extensive propaganda, according to a report on Ukrainian families’ efforts to bring back children whom Russian authorities had forcibly transferred to other parts of occupied Ukrainian territory, and to an open-source study that identified 6,000 Ukrainian children whom Russian authorities had forcibly transferred or deported to Russia.

The Russian government has allocated 46 billion rubles (US$512.4 million) to fund “patriotic education” in 2024, including 270 million rubles ($3 million) for Youth Army, an organization established by Russia’s Defense Ministry that prepares children to join the military, disseminates anti-Ukrainian propaganda, and is active in occupied Ukrainian territories as well as in Russia. According to a UN report published in March 2024, Russian authorities also inducted Ukrainian children in Zaporizhzhia into the “Youth South” movement where they participate in “maintaining public order” and “interact directly” with frontline Russian soldiers, according to an occupation official.

By March 2022, shortly after the full-scale invasion, Russian schools launched “Lessons about Things that Matter.” These weekly sessions, during which the Russian Education Ministry instructs teachers to appeal to their students’ “patriotism,” are taught “in every school in the country,” which Russia defines as including the supposedly annexed regions of Ukraine. In 2024, a Russian deputy education minister stated that the sessions “seek to develop pupils’ values towards Russia, its attitudes, history, environment, and great culture.” Although the content of such sessions varies, in the days after the full-scale invasion, schools in Moscow region received instructions to emphasize, among other things, the propaganda reflected in the new history textbook, including that Russia is conducting a “special peacekeeping operation” to stop a “nightmare of genocide” against “millions” of ethnic Russians and Russian speakers in the Donetska and Luhanska regions of Ukraine; and that the “operation” was also necessary to protect Russia from attack by the West. The weekly sessions are not part of formal curriculum but students who wish to opt out, and their parents, risk pressure from school officials.





Imposition of Russian Language of Instruction and Russian Curriculum, and Denial of Mother-Tongue Education

The Russian authorities’ unlawful changes to the education system in areas of Ukraine occupied after February 2022 reflect, on an accelerated timescale, the changes imposed by Russian proxy authorities after 2014 in the so-called DNR and LNR and in Crimea.

In Horlivka, a city near Donetsk, for example, Russian proxy authorities continued to use Ukrainian school books “for several years” after 2014 before completely switching to the Russian curriculum, according to a local education expert.

Nonetheless, the impact of the changes imposed in occupied territory after 2014 were drastic. The number of students in classes with Ukrainian as the language of instruction in Crimea plummeted from 13,000 students in 2014 to 300 in 2017, within three years of Russia’s occupation of the peninsula. In January 2024, a Russian deputy education minister stated that Ukrainian is the language of instruction in only two schools in Crimea.

Announcements by Russian authorities and their proxies initially indicated a gradual approach to changes in the language of instruction that would, at least to a certain extent, take into account the wishes of the occupied population. At a meeting of local education staff in Borova, in Kharkivska region, occupation officials who identified themselves as “the representatives of the military district educational administration” said in May 2022 that there would be a transitional period of several months, during which it would be permitted to teach in Ukrainian while introducing the Russian curriculum. On August 1, 2022, Russia’s deputy education minister said that all Ukrainian schools under occupation would follow the Russian curriculum, but could use the Ukrainian language to teach.

Despite these promises, the occupying authorities did not permit a “transition period” to the use of Russian as the language of instruction in Ukrainian schools. In Shevchenkove, a municipality in Kharkivska region, a delegation from Russia informed local teachers in June 2022 that “if parents write a request, there might be one hour of Ukrainian language [instruction] per week. But it’s not going to be like LNR and DNR where they started with a transition period. Here it would be all Russian language,” teachers who attended the meeting told Human Rights Watch. Prior to the occupation, schools in Kharkivska taught primarily in Ukrainian, with children having the option of classes in Russian or other languages.

On August 12, Russia’s Education Ministry stated that the language of instruction in occupied Ukraine would be Russian, with schools outside the “DNR” and “LNR” given the option of teaching classes in Ukrainian only as a “native language” or as an “optional” language for a few hours per week. In late August and early September, the authorities in occupied areas of the Zaporizka and Khersonska regions decided that schools would teach at most three hours of Ukrainian language per week.

The occupying authorities have subjected some children who spoke Ukrainian in schools to ill-treatment. A teacher from Melitopol who remains in contact with the family of a former student, who is under 18, told Human Rights Watch that occupying authorities “put a bag on [the boy’s] head for speaking Ukrainian and dumped him thirty kilometers outside the city.” Amnesty International reported in December 2023 that “informants have been appointed [by occupying authorities] from among school students whose task is to identify and report on those children who speak Ukrainian,” and that the authorities threatened offenders with being removed from their families and that their parents would be punished by the de-facto authorities.

Before the start of the school year in September 2022, Russia’s Education Ministry reportedly shipped 5 million Russian textbooks to Ukraine, and Russian regional authorities sent another 2.5 million textbooks. Teachers from several regular Ukrainian schools confirmed to Human Rights Watch that Russian textbooks had arrived during the occupation.

Teachers said that in addition to imposing Russian textbooks, occupying authorities also confiscated and destroyed Ukrainian school materials.

In Borova, in Kharkivska region, Russian authorities delivered Russian textbooks to schools for the scheduled start of the school year, September 1, 2022, and held a meeting for students on September 2, “but they couldn’t give out the books because there was heavy shelling, and then the school year was delayed to October 1, and then it was the hostilities,” a teacher said, referring to the Ukrainian counteroffensive. Before retreating with Russian forces, occupying authorities “burned some of the Ukrainian books, and took others. We are giving the [Ukrainian textbooks] that were left behind to our students and also to kids from other villages,” a teacher said. When Human Rights Watch researchers visited the Borova school in November 2022, the teachers showed packs of Russian textbooks, which still remained on the premises.

The textbooks, including in social sciences, were regular textbooks used in Russian schools, grades 1 to 11. A high school history textbook included a section glorifying the occupation of Crimea. Human Rights Watch obtained copies of two documents, which state that in the Balakliya district of Kharkivska region, a special commission of school employees working with the occupying authorities had inventoried and seized Ukrainian textbooks, and other materials from the Yakovenkove school and School No. 3 in Balakliya, the district center.

Torture and Coercion of Teachers

Initially, in the spring and summer of 2022, occupying authorities tried to recruit teachers with promises of pay and humanitarian aid, teachers said. Occupying authorities in Shevchenkove and Borova promised to pay teachers 20,000 rubles (US$200) or more per month, teachers said, which was consistent with copies of written orders Russian forces left behind when they retreated. But teachers whom Human Rights Watch spoke to in Kharkivska region were not aware of any cases in which the occupying authorities actually paid teachers’ salaries before the Ukrainian counteroffensive forced Russian troops to retreat.

However, teachers also described pressure, threats, arbitrary detention, and torture by the occupying authorities to make them participate in or support the establishment of the Russian education system. The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) also documented 13 cases where Russian and occupation officials arbitrarily detained, tortured or otherwise ill-treated, or threatened with violence Ukrainian school administrators and teachers who refused to teach under the Russian system, as of December 2023. In a particularly disturbing case, “a school director in Kherson region was arbitrarily detained twice (for a total of 40 days), during which he was punched and kicked to pressure him into cooperating.” In a few cases Human Rights Watch documented, occupying authorities expelled, to Ukrainian-held territory, educators who refused to collaborate.

Attacks on and mistreatment of civilians violate the laws of war, and may, for example in the case of torture, constitute war crimes. The injuring and abduction of teachers and education staff falls within the UN framework of attacks on education, one of six grave violations against children in armed conflict.

Russian forces occupied the city of Izium in mid-March 2022 and “did a kind of filtration, so people told them who were the teachers at the schools,” Tetiana, a math teacher and teachers’ union representative recalled. The head of the occupation education department came with soldiers to Tetiana’s home: “If a guy with an AK-47 comes to your house and asks you to come to school, it’s complicated [to refuse]. But I refused.”

Lyudmila, a deputy school director from Borova, said that while the area was occupied in 2022, “Russian FSB [Federal Security Service officers] came to [my home] and [repeatedly] asked me ‘Why aren’t you coming to work for us, what are you waiting for?’” Occupation officials warned that school workers who did not promptly agree to work would be barred from education jobs in the future. “There was psychological pressure—you will lose your jobs, you will have no possibility to work. They were scaring us,” Lyudmila said.

Galina, director of a kindergarten in Yakovenkove village in Balakliya district, said occupation officials decided to re-open one kindergarten in the area, and to convert the kindergarten where Galina worked into a hospice for older people. In late July or early August 2022, armed occupation officials came to her home and ordered her to show them the kindergarten. Then on August 18, “a Niva [4x4 vehicle] was waiting for me.” Armed men who “said they were the people’s militia [working for the occupying administration]” accused her of taking away kindergarten computers. Galina had told her colleagues to take the computers home, and she had also hidden students’ files. The men took her to their office, where another man put a bag on her head and drove her to what she learned was the FSB office that Russian authorities had established in the Balakliya district police station. She overheard an official say she was due to be interrogated by “Tourist,” an agent’s nom de guerre. She was taken to a basement room and detained with a local school director who had been detained the previous day and a woman who had worked for a local Ukrainian government agency.

The next day, occupying authorities expelled the three women, but first ordered them to record a compromising video because, Galina said, “They wanted to blackmail us. They didn’t publish it, but they were going to use it maybe if we were on the news [after leaving the occupied area].” A Russian officer told them, “I’m turning on the phone, and you must repeat what you hear” into a video camera, Galina recalled. “The woman on the phone said she hates the Ukrainian security forces and loves the Russian Federation. All three of us had to repeat this. They recorded me four times because they didn’t like the way I said it.”

Russian officials then ordered the women to cross the front lines to the Ukrainian-controlled side. Galina’s husband picked her up in their car; authorities allowed him to bring their dog but not his own mother. The school director was not allowed to take her husband with her. They were escorted to the Russian frontline where an FSB official told them, “You can’t return. We will shoot you.” They drove for five kilometers through the line of contact on a road “with fallen trees, and full of craters. It was hot. I could smell dead human bodies.” They reached the first Ukrainian checkpoint as shelling began nearby. “I plugged my ears with cloth so it wouldn’t be so loud. We were flying [driving very fast] to the next [Ukrainian] checkpoint,” Galina said. She returned home after Ukrainian forces re-took Balakliya; her husband’s mother survived.

According to a media report, Lidiya Tilna, a teacher from the village of Ivanivka, some 100 km north of Balakliya, was detained for 19 days during the occupation in 2022, and was beaten by Russian interrogators for refusing to set up a school under occupying authorities. The director of a civil society organization described the case of a teacher she knew in Khersonska region “whose son was kidnapped [during the summer of 2022] and he was threatened that he needs to work with Russia if he wants to see his son again.” When the child, under age 18, was returned, the family escaped to Ukrainian-controlled territory.

In Balakliya, the occupation “mayor” sent his car to bring Inna Mandryka, acting principal of School No. 5, from her home to his office before the school year was due to start in September 2022. He told her, “‘You’re going to be the principal’. I said, ‘No I’m not,’ and he said, ‘You don’t know me very well. You are going to be the principal.’” She refused. In Shevchenkove, a teacher who later escaped to Ukrainian-controlled territory said, “men came to my home and ordered me to report to their director. He said that if I did not agree to start the school year, I’d go to ‘the basement’ for two days.” In the village of Vasylenkove, a physical education teacher said armed occupying authorities “came to [my home] and put a pistol on my table and said, ‘My friend, why didn’t you tell us your wife is the school principal?’” He replied that his wife had left for Kharkiv; they were both eventually able to escape.

Vitaliy Chernov, the school director in the village of Borivske, described how Russian security officers tortured him for refusing to hand over information about his school. Chernov told Human Rights Watch that he hid the school’s computers and files, but on September 2, 2022— “my wedding anniversary,” he recalled—he saw “six men in balaclavas shoving my son into the house.” They demanded Chernov turn over “all the school documents,” confiscated his laptop and other devices, and took him to Kupiansk, where he was detained for three days in the local detention center’s small holding yard, open to the sky. On the third day, he was taken inside, where an FSB officer attached electric terminals to Chernov’s pinkie fingers and electro-shocked him for 30 minutes, a torture method known as “the telephone,” he learned. Chernov said,

He repeatedly asked about the missing documents from the school, and I said I did not know what happened. He then said that if I wanted to go home, I needed to give them “some meaningful information” – if not about the documents, then about people from Borivske who served in the Ukrainian army or bad-mouthed Russia or had hidden weapons. I kept saying that I wasn’t very social, did not get out much… “Do you have anything else to share with us?” He sounded exasperated and that’s when I was hit with the first jolt of electricity.

Before ordering the guards to take Chernov away, the interrogator threatened, “Unless you start talking, we’ll be giving you these treatments till the end of the special military operation.” The guards moved Chernov to an overcrowded cell inside the building. He stayed there overnight and for three more days and was tortured again on the second day of his confinement in that cell, according to Chernov. While fleeing shelling from the Ukrainian counter-offensive the Russian guards abandoned the detainees, who remained locked in their cells. Men in one cell managed to break out from the window and helped Chernov and others to escape.

Penalties for Participating in Online Ukrainian Education in Occupied Territory

Russian authorities and their proxies harass and retaliate against teachers for involvement in Ukrainian remote learning programs. Nonetheless, at the start of the 2023-24 school year, roughly 80,000 Ukrainian children in Russian-occupied areas were exercising their rights and studying the Ukrainian curriculum online, at risk of retaliation against them and their families by occupying authorities.

Occupying authorities require Ukrainian children to attend school in person and warn parents that their children must not attend Ukrainian schools online, said Alina, an English teacher from Rubizhne, Luhanska region. In one case in the Zaporizka region, a student messaged their Ukrainian teacher that occupying authorities “found out that I was studying [the Ukrainian curriculum online] and took my father away, so I have to stop,” according to a humanitarian education official. “They are going house to house, to confirm kids are in Russian schools,” the official said. The UN reported that Russian authorities detained a teacher in Zaporizka region for two days for teaching the Ukrainian curriculum online, threatened to torture her and harm her father, pressured her to sign a pledge she would not teach, and stated that they were monitoring her IT devices when they released her.

In Mariupol, the occupying authorities “check that each child goes to school and doesn’t attend online Ukrainian school. Home schooling is not allowed. They check if you send your kid to Ukrainian school online on the weekend, and you could lose custody [if you do],” said Yaroslava Mozghova, who heads a Ukrainian civil society group that supports online education.

A teacher in Melitopol was detained by occupying authorities for attending an online Ukrainian program for educational leaders, Mozghova said. In Melitopol, if a child does not attend Russian school, their family risks a 40,000 ruble [US$402] fine “or threats to take away their children,” said Hanna Bout, a vocational school teacher who escaped. According to Bout’s contacts in Melitopol, occupying authorities “are going around schools, forcing pupils to delete their online classroom accounts where [Ukrainian school] videos were posted and homework was submitted. Some officials forced them to write a note saying, ‘I resigned from Ukrainian school, and I will go to Russian school.’”

Bout knows a first-grade teacher whom occupying authorities interrogated “because she was teaching the Ukrainian curriculum online.” She said the authorities confiscated the teacher’s computer and phone after the interrogation. Bout also knew of two families whose children attended Ukrainian classes online and were fearful they would be found out. One of the two families “didn’t go outside with [their school-age daughter] for eight months because they were so scared of checkpoints where [the occupying authorities] might force the child to go to a Russian school or search their phone and find messages about the [Ukrainian] school.”

Ukrainian education staff continued to work in occupied territories despite the risks. During the summer of 2022, Inna, a deputy school director in then-occupied Balakliya, worked secretly in her basement to create the school work plan that was necessary to begin the school year, and which could be used for remote learning. She uploaded the plan onto her phone, in order to send it to her school director who was in Ukrainian-controlled territory, but Inna had no connectivity in Balakliya’s outskirt district called Lageria. She rode her bicycle through Russian checkpoints to the city, where she could climb to the top floor of a nine-story building to get a connection, she said.

The Russians at the checkpoints, they were checking you. The documents were on my phone so I had to hide my phone in my undies. They were frisking me. If they found out, I would be taken to “the basement.” I managed to send the documents to the principal, and the school started the new year.

In areas that are still occupied, it may not be possible to study the Ukrainian curriculum, even when Ukrainian educators are willing to risk persecution for teaching it and even when children have devices and connectivity. Russian occupying authorities in Mariupol, for example, had blocked internet access to Ukrainian online learning platforms, according to a teacher whose former students who were still there.

A Ukrainian teacher who escaped from an occupied area of the Zaporizka region and continues to teach online classes for children there, told a news website that her students had to avoid detection by occupying authorities. One student barely left his home in six months, while another boy left home with a backpack each school-day, as if he were going to Russian school, but actually went to a relative’s house to study the Ukrainian curriculum online, the teacher said. A 5 grade student received psychosocial support for “a nervous breakdown” in the second semester of the 2022-23 school year after a Russian teacher discovered he was studying the Ukrainian curriculum online and informed the occupying police authorities.

Coercion of Parents with School-Age Children

Occupying authorities have imposed penalties on parents who failed to send their children to Russian-controlled schools, even if their children were participating in the Ukrainian education available online, which is, in any case, prohibited. In Balakliya, the occupying authorities created neighborhood “street committees” (ulichkomy), and designated people to act as the interface between residents and the authorities, teachers said. These committees were instructed to inform parents that families who failed to send their children to “Russian school” would suffer consequences. “In some cases, they came to each house, and said either you apply for the schools, or we will take your children to [the Russian city of] Belgorod [to be schooled there],” a teacher said. “They were spreading rumors to scare people.”

In Zaporizka region, an education expert from ZMINA—a Ukrainian non-governmental human rights group—identified five cases in Berdiansk, where occupying authorities imposed fines on parents who failed to send their children to schools, even though they were participating in education at home. Occupying authorities detained a man from a village near Nova Kakhovka, in Khersonska region, in October 2022 because he had not put his daughter in Russian school, Amnesty International reported. According to the report, he was detained for six days, and said, “they only beat me for one day.”

Hanna Bout, the vocational school teacher from Melitopol who escaped to Kyiv and remained in contact with her former colleagues, said, “One [former colleague] got an SMS saying, “If you don’t send your kids [to school], we will force you to join the Russian army.”

Olha, a teacher in Shevchenkove, recalled that occupying authorities offered parents with school-age children free school backpacks as well as one-time payments of 10,000 rubles ($100) to enroll their children, but also threatened them. Some parents told her they were warned by de facto authorities, “if you do not send your kids to the school, the kids will be sent to an orphanage.” A teacher from an occupied area of Zaporizka region told a Ukrainian news website that occupying authorities offered to pay 4,000 rubles ($44) per month to families whose children attended Russian schools, while students who studied the Ukrainian curriculum online at home were afraid of being reported to the occupying authorities.

Reports indicate that Ukrainian parents continue to face coercion related to their children’s education from occupying authorities. In occupied Tokmak, for example, parents were reportedly pressured to “demand” access to Russian schools for their children at the start of the 2023 school year. The UN also reported cases in Zaporizka and Khersonska regions where Russian authorities threatened parents their children would be taken away if they were not sent to Russian schools, and that Russian forces checked mobile phones for Ukrainian online education apps.

Interrupted Education During Occupation

During the 2022-23 school year, many children living under Russian occupation received little or no education from Russian authorities, even as those authorities prohibited Ukrainian schooling. In Melitopol, which had five vocational schools before the occupation, Russian authorities set up one vocational facility, at School No. 16, a teacher who escaped to western Ukraine said. Only two of the 70 teachers at her former school agreed to work under the occupying authorities, “so the physical education teachers were teaching five subjects” in late 2022.

In Shevchenkove there were 1,600 students at 11 schools before the full-scale invasion but, according to records left behind when Russian forces retreated in September 2022, only 60 children were enrolled in “Russian” schools and, even so, according to local teachers, there were not enough staff to run classes. “They opened the school, with the Russian national anthem, on September 1, but it was just a show, [to make it appear] as if something was working,” one teacher said.

In Rubizhne, in Luhanska oblast, Russian occupying authorities re-opened just one of 11 schools for the 2022-2023 school year, according to Alina, an English teacher who had escaped to Kyiv. The school had no water, electricity, or internet, and was holding classes once a week, she said. Alina and her colleagues had seen videos on social media of the newly appointed school director praising the Russian authorities:

In one video, Russian soldiers are bringing desks and chairs to the school, and she is saying, “Glory to God, they brought us furniture!” We were so upset when we saw that. We [the school, previously] had laptops, furniture, everything. Now, you only have broken windows, and you’re happy with some desks?

In total, Ukrainian experts estimated in April 2023 that there were one million school-age Ukrainian children in Russian-occupied territory. A far smaller number of students were registered for the 2022-23 school year, according to Russian claims: 160,000 in so-called DNR, 105,000 students in so-called LNR, 18,000 in the then-occupied territory of Khersonska region, and 16,000 in the then-occupied territory of Kharkivska region. Even these figures may have been exaggerated, as Russian officials apparently sought to project the image of a rapid, large-scale, successful take-over of education in newly occupied Ukrainian territory. In Khersonska region, the occupying authorities stated on August 5, 2022 that 645 teachers had “volunteered” to work and would teach 10,740 students. By September 1, Russian media and occupation officials claimed that 800 teachers had already been re-certified to teach the Russian curriculum and that 18,000 students had begun the school year.

Ukrainian authorities planning to re-establish education in formerly occupied territory may need to develop programs to assess and provide lessons tailored not only to children who have been subjected to the Russian education system, but also to children who had little access to any learning at all under occupation.





II. Collaboration in the Sphere of Education

As noted, a small minority of Ukrainian education staff in Kharkivska region agreed to work with the occupying authorities. Several teachers told Human Rights Watch about individual staff in their respective schools who had worked with the occupying authorities and then fled to Russia when Ukrainian forces liberated the area. In Izium, the head of the local teachers’ union estimated that 30 out of the pre-2022-invasion total of roughly 700 teachers, at nine schools, were later suspected of having worked with the occupying authorities. At one school in Kupiansk, 81 out of 82 teachers worked with the occupation, by far the highest proportion in Kharkivska region, according to the head of education for the region.

However, Human Rights Watch identified concerns that Ukrainian authorities’ efforts to punish collaborators in the education sphere have not always conformed to the requirements of international law.

Ukraine’s Filtration and Prosecution of Education Staff

In early March 2022, Ukraine established the crime of wartime collaboration, through amendments to the Criminal Code. The amendments include prohibitions of actions “aimed at implementing the education standards of the aggressor state in educational institutions,” as well as “propaganda in educational institutions […] to facilitate the armed aggression against Ukraine, [the] establishment and consolidation of the temporary occupation …, [or] avoidance of responsibility for the armed aggression against Ukraine by the aggressor state.” Penalties range from two years of community service to three years in prison and a 10 to 15-year ban on holding positions in the sphere of public education.

According to the data collected by the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine and shared with Human Rights Watch, as of March 15, 2024, Ukrainian courts had issued 1,168 verdicts in criminal cases related to charges of “collaboration activities” under Criminal Code article 111-1. Of this total, guilty verdicts were issued against 35 school headmasters or their deputies, university administration employees, and employees of “educational departments” in occupied territory, for “the implementation of education standards of the Russian Federation” or “propaganda in educational facilities.” In about half of these cases, the defendants were convicted in absentia. All were banned from holding certain positions, and most were sentenced to from 1 to 10 years imprisonment.

The head of the Kharkivska Regional Department of Education told Human Rights Watch that according to guidance from the Ministry of Education and Science, which is not available in the public domain, the law applies to school workers in three cases: “if they started teaching the Russian curriculum, if they participated in trainings on Russian territory or any trainings held by the Russians, or if they signed an agreement to go to work with the occupying powers.”

However, a letter the Ministry of Education and Science sent to heads of educational institutions and district and regional administrations in September 2022, which Human Rights Watch later obtained, spells out a broader, harsher approach. The letter warns educational workers that “treason and cooperation with the occupiers are criminal offenses and result in severe punishment.” The letter emphasizes that working in any managerial, teaching or research position under the occupying authorities is “categorically unacceptable.” While “the scale and consequences of such behavior” will be considered by a court of law when determining the severity of punishment in individual cases, the letter states, “the blatant nature of the crime is beyond doubt” with regard to these actions.

The letter specifies elements of collaboration, including “participation in the educational process under the occupying power” and “implementation of the education standards of the aggressor state.” It states that allegations of such actions must be confirmed by factual evidence, documented by an official investigation. The letter refers to Methodological Guidelines by the National Agency for Prevention of Corruption regarding identifying collaboration. However, the guidelines, which Human Rights Watch reviewed, approach collaboration as a broad offense, without establishing specific thresholds that would have to be met for an action to be considered an offense.

Ukrainian law enforcement authorities also appear to take a broad approach to defining and prosecuting collaboration, including as it regards teachers and professors who allegedly justified the Russian invasion or shared pro-Russian propaganda with students. In Zhytomyr, according to a person working on the humanitarian education response, there was “one case of a teacher who was prosecuted for collaboration for ‘promoting Russian narratives’.” In several cases, courts have taken into account the repentance of people who pled guilty and banned them from holding public office for 10 or 13 years, but did not sentence them to prison.

Between May 2022 and August 2023, Human Rights Watch tabulated 293 prosecutions under the law, of which just 9 involved education staff. Their sentences ranged from fines, up to five years imprisonment and, in all of the recorded cases, bans from working in the sphere of education for 10 to 15 years. All of the convicted persons were heads or deputy heads of educational facilities or those who worked in education departments under occupying authorities. The accusations included organizing education under occupation, implementing the Russian curriculum, and indoctrination in pro-Russian propaganda.

In one case, for example, a teacher was sentenced to a fine, three years imprisonment and a 15-year ban on working in education for assuming, under occupation, the role of acting director of a lyceum. The court’s verdict held that she was not coerced into accepting the role, but it did not provide a reasoned justification for dismissing her claims at trial that she felt threatened by the Russian military and felt she had no choice but to take the position to protect the children. In only three of the nine cases was the accused physically present in the courtroom, two of whom pled guilty for reduced sentences; four others were tried in absentia and two were tried via videoconference.

Ukrainian civil society groups raised concerns of double jeopardy (multiple prosecutions for the same offense), disproportionate penalties, and penalties for acts that do not demonstrate support for Russia’s war efforts against Ukraine. Ukraine’s Education Ombudsperson told Human Rights Watch that the law should more clearly distinguish between “when people did this voluntarily and when they did it under pressure.” His office “received many questions from teachers” about the collaboration legislation, “and I can only advise them to collect evidence of the pressure they might have been under by the occupier.”

As described in a previous section, occupying authorities in some cases used threats and violence to coerce educators to work in schools. Some teachers also worked under occupation in order to obtain basic necessities. A teacher from a vocational school in Izium said:

We had absolutely nothing for two months [March and April 2022]. People were killed while gardening in their yards to grow food. My neighbor was killed by a cluster bomb. There was no bread. We collected rainwater to wash in. I think the Russians did it on purpose, to make people go and work to receive food. In the second half of May they started giving us food for cleaning [the school], but with desperately long delays.

Teachers from Kharkivska and Luhanska regions said Russian authorities provided humanitarian aid, consisting of one cup of rice, one cup of flour, canned tuna and canned meat, for cleaning up schools that troops had used as barracks and for moving dead bodies and digging graves.

The anti-collaboration legislation also fails to distinguish between teachers who agreed to teach subjects like “physics and mathematics” that are “not ideological,” as opposed to “history, taught in the Russian manner,” Ukraine’s Education Ombudsperson said. The ombudsperson was aware of false accusations of collaboration that “leads to violations of [teachers’] rights.”

The head of the Kharkiv regional teachers’ union said she believed that “teachers who had no other option, who were at gunpoint, will not be in trouble.”[145] A Mariupol university rector who had fled the city similarly said that only teachers “who joined the occupying power of their own free will, and promoted the Russian educational system, will be prosecuted.”

However, staff from a vocational institute in Kharkivska region said a colleague who “did not do anything against Ukraine” but whose motives for collaborating with occupying authorities were pragmatic, had been detained for three weeks for “filtration” when Ukraine re-established control over these territories. When their area fell under occupation, the institute’s staff had voted for this colleague to be acting director “in order for him to represent us in relation to the occupying authorities, to prevent looting, and control the process so we could receive humanitarian aid.” Russian authorities sent him to Belgorod, in Russia, where he was “taken to different vocational schools and given teaching materials,” which were not used, staff members said. Teachers in Borova said that six teachers had agreed in writing to work with the occupying authorities. They also went through Ukrainian SBU filtration and were later released.

Filtration is a compulsory security screening, the use of which is strictly limited as an exceptional measure of last resort under international law. The laws of war do not directly address wartime collaboration, but do require the occupying power to facilitate the proper working of institutions dedicated to the education of children, with the co-operation of the national and local authorities. The law on occupation also prohibits occupying forces from exercising coercion against civilians who are not their own nationals, anticipating occupation forces’ efforts to do so. The Ukrainian authorities should not penalize teachers in occupied territories solely for providing education to children under the Russian curriculum, and should ensure that the policies, measures and laws on collaboration, filtration procedures, and administrative punishments are implemented in a manner consistent with Ukraine’s due process and fair trial obligations under international human rights law.

Charges of collaboration should be considered only for those against whom there is evidence of aggravating actions constituting willful collaboration in a way that threatens Ukraine’s security. The authorities should review the broadly phrased definition of collaboration under the law and relevant sanctions to ensure the necessary human rights and due process safeguards are upheld.

Administrative Measures by Ukrainian Education Officials

Ukrainian education officials have also taken administrative measures against suspected collaborators under their legal authority to decide staffing and termination policies and to fire teachers for serious violations of ethical norms. The September 2022 education ministry letter states that any education staff member “who has defiled himself with collaboration activities should be immediately dismissed” for “committing an immoral offense” under article 41 of the Labor Code. The letter does not raise the issue of coercion. In fact, it affirms that teachers who collaborated must be fired even if they managed ""to simultaneously fulfill the duties of distance education to Ukrainian students.” The letter stated that while courts of law will determine the severity of criminal punishment, “the blatant nature of the crime is beyond doubt.”

In Borivske, a school principal said that he knew of only one teacher—one of the schools’ former students—who agreed to teach under the occupation. The Ukrainian SBU closed its investigation against her “because she had not signed anything,” but the teacher resigned after the education ministry notified her she would be fired, he said.

Education officials also screen teachers who resumed working in de-occupied areas before paying their salaries, “so some teachers will receive their salary retroactively, some might not,” the teachers’ union head said. Yulia, a school director from Vasylenkove, said her staff received their July 2022 salary in November, 2022 because “they said they were checking the lists for collaborators.” The head of the Kharkivska regional education department, Oleksiy Litvinov, described the process as “complicated and bureaucratic, but necessary to exclude collaborators.”

The screening process starts with each school director sending a list of staff members at their school who should be paid to the district-level administration, which verifies that there are no collaborators on the lists drawn up by the authorities. This first step can be delayed due to staff shortages in local administrations following occupation. The district then sends the verified list to the regional administration, which requires the regional head of the education department to verify the list again. “We verify lists twice a day,” Oleksiy Litvinov said. “But there’s no electricity, and they have to send me this list online.” Finally, the regional administration sends the list to the government’s financial bodies, which transfer the funds.

Any administrative penalties that Ukraine imposes on teachers who worked for the occupying authorities should be consistent with the principles of legality, necessity, non-discrimination, and proportionality, as well as fair trial standards and effective remedies. The UN committee of experts that oversees implementation by states of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights has stated that the Covenant’s prohibition of “any propaganda for war and any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence … [is] fully compatible with the right of freedom of expression … the exercise of which carries with it special duties and responsibilities.” Ukraine has, in any case, entered a derogation to full implementation of standards on freedom of expression under international law, along with other derogations, citing the Russian invasion.

Enforcing the wartime restriction on pro-Russian expression by firing a teacher, as opposed to a fine, or requiring an apology or guarantee of non-repetition, after the situation in their area has returned to Ukrainian government control, should be assessed for its necessity and proportionality. Ukraine should also ensure that measures intended to prevent payment of salaries to teachers accused of collaboration are consistent with other policies about salary payment while a teacher is under suspicion of a disciplinary infraction. Such measures should also be necessary, proportional in terms of the number of teachers affected by delayed salaries, and the accused should have the opportunity to mount an effective defense and appeal.





III. Ukrainian Efforts to Provide Education After the Full-Scale Invasion

The war and occupation of parts of the country has forced Ukrainian education authorities and educators to adapt. For example, at the end of the 2021-22 academic year, Ukraine’s Ministry of Education and Science automatically advanced all Ukrainian students to the next grade level. In 2022-23, the ministry did not advance students in schools in occupied territory that were following the Russian curriculum to the next grade level, as Ukrainian authorities had designated those schools as “non-functional.”

Among the positive examples of innovation aimed at improving access to education in Ukraine, the education ministry, working with civil society, has promoted online learning, with online textbooks, to reach children whose schools were closed for security concerns, particularly if staff and students would have had insufficient time to reach bomb shelters during air raid alerts, and to reach children across front-lines and in occupied territories. In Lvivska region, the ministry established a school that exclusively offers distance learning classes; at least 450 of the 1,000 students enrolled are from areas under occupation, a humanitarian education expert said.

During COVID-19, in coordination with the Ministry of Education and Science, the Osvitoria Hub, a civil society initiative, developed a non-formal distance-learning module, “All Ukrainian School.” The platform proved to be effective during the war, having more than 10,000 video lessons for all classes from grades 5 to 11, the director said, and grades 1 to 4 are in development at the time of writing. UNESCO donated 50,000 Chromebook computers to teachers nationwide. Students across Ukraine received 10,000 tablets and laptop computers, with another 10,000 devices donated to newly de-occupied areas of Khersonska and Kharkivska regions in 2023 from Korea and the EU.

Ukraine’s Ministry of Education and Science has emphasized that among the aims of the online education program “is to ensure proper conditions for obtaining education in territories not controlled by Ukraine.” Data that the Ukrainian Ministry of Education and Science provided Human Rights Watch indicate that 62,436 children living in occupied areas continue to study in Ukrainian secondary education institutions remotely.

Reaching children in occupied areas with online education remains particularly challenging, however, as Russian authorities and their proxies moved to cut off all non-Russian telecommunications providers in those areas following on the occupation. Russian occupying authorities in Mariupol blocked internet access to Ukrainian online learning platforms, according to a teacher whose former students were still there. As a result, local residents had no choice but to acquire Russian or so-called DNR SIM-cards, the use of which makes it impossible for them to access Ukrainian websites. As Stas Prybytko, head of mobile broadband development in Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation, said in an interview to the New York Times in August 2022, “The first thing that an occupier does when they come to Ukrainian territory is cut off the networks.” Instead of following the Ukrainian curriculum online, children in occupied territories are mainly limited to receiving and filing assignments with teachers on Viber or Telegram messengers, which are both accessible via Russian providers or so-called DNR’s Phoenix.

To ensure access to education for internally displaced children, the ministry has simplified the enrollment procedure and introduced flexible timing for the determination of final grades and have emphasized the possibility of using pass/fail grading. The education ministry also simplified university entrance examinations and held them online, on multiple days, with 187,000 test-takers from Ukraine and among Ukrainian refugees across Europe. A teacher from Izium said her 11 grade students were now “in Ireland, Israel, Germany, the Netherlands, and Canada, and they took the test.” In Melitopol, a woman managed to smuggle diplomas that were printed in Zaporizhzhia into occupied territory for students there who had graduated in the Ukrainian curriculum. A school in Shevchenkove finished the school year using the Ukrainian curriculum via distance learning, and students who evacuated to Ukrainian-controlled territory received certificates.

Under Ukrainian law, citizens in Russian occupied territory have the right to pursue their education in other parts of Ukraine, for which the state will pay and provide accommodation in dormitories. The occupying authorities in Kharkivska region destroyed students’ files in some schools before retreating, but teachers said that students who escaped without identification documents or school records had been able to enroll in schools in Ukrainian-controlled territory. In a positive move, a law passed by Ukraine’s parliament and signed by the president in 2023, which came into effect on March 24, 2024, allows for the evaluation and certification of education received under the occupying authorities after 2014.

Ukrainian civil society and education officials have raised concerns about filling gaps in the education of children who attended school in Russian-occupied areas. The head of the Kharkivska Regional Department of Education described regional efforts to reintegrate students from de-occupied territories in schools, including children who received Russian school certificates or who had begun classes under the Russian curriculum. After Ukraine’s counter-offensive, education staff “went around all the apartments where there are children and got the phone number of those families so we could help enroll the children in the schools that are functioning,” he said. In addition, students from de-occupied areas were “added to the categories of students who receive privileges in entering higher education—they don’t have to submit certain examinations, and they receive an extra 50 points” on their applications.

A Ukrainian civil society education expert noted that Ukraine should further proceed with these efforts by establishing special lessons or programs to support children who had been enrolled in the Russian education system, to prevent them from “falling into the gap between the [Russian and Ukrainian] curricula.”

Ukraine’s education ombudsperson pointed out that Ukrainian and Russian curricula on math and sciences are very close, and the only areas of concern are Ukrainian language, literature, history, and social sciences. “We help the kids who return [from occupied territories or who lived through occupation]. Each school will come up with its own program to help them catch up,” he said.

Difficulties Accessing Distance Learning

The UN reported in August 2023 that one-third of school children in Ukraine are learning in-person, one-third third receive a mix of in-person and online teaching, and one-third are learning remotely. In the mixed or hybrid model, children attend in-person during alternate weeks, if their schools have bomb shelters. The decision whether or not to suspend in-person schooling is taken at the regional level. In Kharkivska region, regional defense staff decided on August 15, 2022 that all educational facilities would offer distance learning, the regional education department head said:

We are unable to guarantee that children will be able to evacuate to shelters. The flying time of missiles from Belgorod is less than one minute and artillery is even less. It is irresponsible to send children for in-person learning. […] But of course, teachers depend on having internet connectivity, which is a problem in all the de-occupied areas. In addition, the enemy is shelling critical infrastructure including power plants and electrical substations.

Kharkivska region suffered 17 percent of all damage to telecommunications in Ukraine during the first year of the full-scale invasion. More than a month after de-occupation, the head of the Kupiansk district military administration said only one sector in the district had internet connectivity and could offer distance learning. In August 2023, Ukraine evacuated residents of the city of Kupiansk, including 600 children, due to renewed Russian attacks.

Across the country, Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure have reduced power generation capacity from 37 to 19 Gigawatts and destroyed half of the high voltage transformers in Ukrainian-controlled territory. Without adequate electricity or connectivity, in some de-occupied areas the only available instruction is from “parents who are teaching the kids at home,” a humanitarian education expert said. In Balakliya, Russian forces forced internet providers to shut down access to Ukrainian sites in June 2022, an education official said. In de-occupied Izium, one school was teaching 700 students entirely online, but shortened classes to 25 minutes each in three-hour shifts due to rolling electricity blackouts.

After February 24, 2022, schools in Kharkivska region were closed for regular in-person classes, but staff at some schools volunteered to provide time-limited “consultations” with students “to help them catch up,” an education administrator said. “If children can download the [lessons], they come to us at school and we explain [the lessons]. They come for part of the day, twice a week. We come every day.” The regional head of education opposed volunteer initiatives that used school premises for short periods, due to the grave security concern of Russian attacks hitting the schools. Yet such initiatives, if implemented with due precautions, may be a child’s best way to stay connected to learning. Ukrainian authorities could work more closely with teachers to identify and support safe methods of supplementing distance learning in private homes, one teacher suggested. “We’d go house to house to teach if we could,” a principal said.

“Often families who fled occupation do not have any devices [for online study], and sometimes there are four kids per mobile phone,” a humanitarian education staffer noted. Children in upper grades may be particularly affected by the lack of devices. In Izium, a school guard with two school-age children described two months after de-occupation, “[T]he teachers give assignments and we do our best to teach them at home. With [my] younger child we can at least do something, but for the older one, you need a laptop. He can’t set up the virtual classroom on his phone.”

Obstacles to Distance Learning for Children with Disabilities

Displaced children with disabilities can continue education in their original school online. However, even in cases where children have devices and there is connectivity in their area, distance learning can prove inaccessible for children with disabilities. Anna, a teacher, said that the inclusive center where she worked with 30 children with disabilities had stopped classes due to the invasion, but distance learning was wholly ineffective. Parents repeatedly asked Ukrainian authorities to open regular schools on an inclusive basis but were rebuffed due to security concerns about Russian attacks.

There are 17 community-based centers to support children with disabilities in Kharkiv city, but for children with disabilities in outlying communities, as of November 2022, only one bus and three expert staff were available. The educational impact of the Russian invasion was disproportionate for children with disabilities, Anna said, because few of them could escape to areas with accessible schools. Out of 70 children with disabilities in the district she knew of, only seven had been evacuated or were able to escape before the occupation, because “for kids with autism, cerebral palsy, it was too difficult to transfer them.”

To enroll displaced children with disabilities in a new school, their parents first need to present a certificate of registration as internally displaced, and the child must undergo a “comprehensive psychological and pedagogical assessment of the child's development.” Nonetheless, Ukrainian authorities have taken steps to improve access to education for children with disabilities, such as abolishing limits on the number of children with “special educational needs” in an inclusive class or group, and prohibiting schools from refusing to organize inclusive education. With government support, including from the education ministry, UNICEF and the Dzherelo Children’s Rehabilitation Center in Kyiv launched a project to support families with children with disabilities, focusing on children displaced by the war, although the program was not operating in the Kharkivska region. As the League of the Strong and European Disability Forum reported in November 2023, newly-created facilities for displaced children and host communities still have very limited accessible resources for children with disabilities. The report recommends urgently developing” community-based services for children with disabilities, including educational and psychological support services,” and regular monitoring of children’s access to education, among other steps, because distance learning does not meet the needs of many children with disabilities.

Obstacles to Accessing Salaries for Displaced Teachers

In Kharkivska region, about 15,000 teachers did not receive their regular salaries while living under occupation, which lasted for more than six months, the regional teacher’s union director said. A teacher’s union representative from Izium said that her own Ukrainian teaching record stated, “the labor agreement is paused during the occupation,” before her contract was reinstated in October 2022. Many of the 630 requests that Ukraine’s education ombudsman had received from teachers in occupied or de-occupied territories from late February to early November 2022, were about salaries, obtaining the documents needed to teach, and further employment, he said.

Teachers who escaped to Ukraine-controlled territory received their salaries if they or their colleagues were able to flee occupied territory with the required documents and re-register the school in Ukrainian-controlled territory, such that their schools were able to function online using the Ukrainian system, teachers said. This is not the case if the school director works with the occupying authorities; one teacher said his old school “doesn’t exist anymore” for this reason. Children who escaped to Ukrainian-controlled territory could attend classes in other schools while remaining enrolled in their original schools. The director of a school in Izium that was destroyed in the fighting said that the school’s students were all “transferred to other schools for online learning.”

For schoolteachers to be paid, ordinarily their schools must have access to certain documents and electronic data, such as labor books and electronic keys and signatures. Whether or not these documents and equipment were evacuated during the first days of the full-scale Russian invasion often determined whether or not teachers could be paid, teachers said. In Balakliya, education officials escaped to Ukrainian-controlled territory with their “labor books, laptops and equipment, so we could re-start the education process,” an official said. But Alina, a teacher from Luhanska region, said that she and her colleagues were not paid because they had escaped “without any documents, and the accountants at the school didn’t take any servers with them.”

Some teachers whose schools could not be re-opened were hired by other schools in Ukrainian-controlled territory. Some said they needed to obtain an “IDP document, as proof of having relocated to [Ukrainian] government-controlled areas,” which could be difficult for people who fled without identification documents.

The education ministry stated in April 2022 that teachers displaced from occupied territory to Ukrainian-controlled areas who did not find work should be paid two-thirds of their salaries. However, due to the war, Ukraine’s decentralized system of government presents complications to paying the salaries of teachers who are from areas of Ukraine that are occupied and who have not been put on the payroll of another school in Ukrainian-controlled areas. Teachers’ salaries must also be approved by local administrations, and Ukraine suspended many local administrations in Kharkivska region while they were under Russian occupation. These local administrations were re-constituted, but their heads must be approved by the president of Ukraine, a slow process, the regional teachers’ union representative said.

A third issue, according to Ukraine’s education ombudsman, is that after Ukraine introduced martial law in response to the full-scale invasion, some local administrations had sought to reduce their expenditures by pressuring teachers to sign requests to go on unpaid leave and threatening to dismiss them if they refused, and that in addition, directors’ and teachers’ contracts were not being renewed without justification. “This is a question of knowing your rights” under the Labor Code, he said. The ombudsman cited as a positive example the city of Kherson, “where they paid the full salary of teachers [even during occupation], according to the position of the city’s education administration.”

Mental Health and Psychosocial Support

According to UNESCO, by 2023, “26 percent of Ukrainian teenagers have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. 75 percent of schoolchildren have experienced stress. 54 percent of Ukrainian teachers are professionally ‘burned out.’” From February 2022 to February 2024, UNICEF reported that children in frontline cities have had to shelter from attacks in basements, metro stations, or other bomb shelters for up to 5,000 hours during air raid alerts, or nearly seven months in total. The Ukrainian government’s plan to provide mental health and psychosocial support to students and teachers notes that before the full-scale invasion, 35 percent of schools lacked the staff to provide psychosocial services.

Teachers and students from areas occupied by Russian forces told Human Rights Watch about particularly devastating experiences, highlighting the need for vastly scaled up mental health and psychosocial support services.

Staff from a vocational institution in Izium said a Russian airstrike nearby killed a student, Lisa, and seven members of her family, whose remains were buried together “in a bag, in a common grave.” A teacher said an attack in Mariupol killed two of his students along with “their entire family” at their home. The teacher sheltered in his school, Lyceum No. 14, which was shelled “from the first day” by Russian forces, and then fled to School No. 12, until it was taken over by Russian forces. “I think I’m mentally changed. I think some part of me died,” he said. In Izium, 600 local residents, including 52 children, sheltered at a vocational institution during freezing temperatures and heavy shelling without electricity or water; Russian forces entered and detained three men, who were later found hanged in their homes. At a vocational institution in Shevchenkove, the occupation administration assigned dormitories where 10 to 15 students were still living as quarters for Russian troops, according to a teacher who showed Human Rights Watch a phone message from parents stating that soldiers had hit, beaten, or harassed their children.

Ukraine’s education ombudsman pointed out that the Education Ministry requires one psychologist per school with more than 300 students in a village, or more than 700 students in a city. But amidst the war in late 2022, teachers and parents said that the need for mental health support far outweighed availability. A vocational teacher in Izium said the local hospital could not offer psychosocial support. A mother in Izium said that her 8-year-old son “is afraid every time there’s a plane in the sky, or even if something falls off the table,” but no mental health support was available. The only mental health support for children in the de-occupied communities of Kharkivska region that Human Rights Watch visited in late 2022 was provided by a single mobile team from Médecins Sans Frontieres. By May 2023, MSF had provided 2,000 individual counselling sessions in Kharkivska region, although this figure included Kharkiv city, which had not been occupied. By February 2024, the group had provided 26,000 counselling sessions across the country.

A consultant working on mental health in the education sector said, “Teachers need small groups, a safe space to talk to colleagues, and expert support from psychologists who know teachers’ needs.” The consultant argued the need for “a validated, evidence-based toolkit for school psychologists.” National education ministry guidelines “recommend teachers begin the working day with a ‘psychological minute’ but [teachers need] training on how to provide this,” a teacher said in 2022. By mid-2023, Ukraine’s education ministry had approved occupational standards for school psychologists and was working to implement supervision for school psychologists.

Ukrainian volunteer and government initiatives have tried to fill the gap. The State University of Mariupol, which relocated to Kyiv, opened a “humanitarian hub” in June 2022 that provides, in addition to aid, free psychological sessions. However, the psychologist is available for only three days every three weeks. “We have waiting lists,” the university rector said.

The office of the First Lady, Olena Zelenska, initiated a nationwide mental health reform process at the beginning of the full-scale invasion. In 2023, the initiative assessed existing practices, conducting a survey of 4,500 school psychologists, and plans to train 15,000 school psychologists nationwide. In March 2024, with support from UNICEF, Ukraine opened two centers in Kharkivska region to provide mental health support and counselling to families.





IV. International Law, Education, and Occupation

Russia’s wholesale imposition of its own education system in occupied Ukrainian territory and its banning of Ukrainian education in areas under their control violate both international and relevant domestic laws.

The laws of armed conflict require an occupying power to facilitate the education of children and strictly limit the occupying power’s authority to impose changes on curricula and language of instruction. The occupying power must respect, “unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country,” and is obliged to restore and ensure public order and safety and to uphold its human rights obligations toward the population in the occupied territory. With regard to education, the occupying power, therefore, may not “tamper with educational materials, syllabi, curriculum, etc.”, as a legal scholar notes, except insofar as necessary to remove educational materials that promote hatred and intolerance.

Ukraine’s 2017 law on education, among its other provisions, guarantees education in the Ukrainian language. Russia has limited instruction in the Ukrainian language in the areas it occupies to a few hours per week at most. On January 31, 2024, the International Court of Justice found that Russia’s “legislative and other practices … with regard to school education in the Ukrainian language in Crimea,” after occupying that territory in 2014, “constitutes a pattern of racial discrimination” under the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.

Ukraine’s law on education also guarantees education in the first languages of students who are members of one of the “indigenous people of Ukraine,” such as Crimean Tatars. The Council of Europe reported in 2023 that following the Russian occupation that began on the Crimean Peninsula in 2014, Crimean Tatar students do not have access to instruction in their native language, but only to study it as a subject or an extracurricular activity, with “insufficient availability, quantity and quality of education” in the language.

Russia’s international human rights obligation to ensure that education is “directed to … the development of respect for the child's … cultural identity, language and values” extends to the territory it occupies in Ukraine. Russia is also prohibited from denying a child “the right … to use his or her own language.” A UN expert has found that children “have better academic results and will stay in school longer” when they are educated in their own language. Evidence also shows that early learning is most effective in the child’s mother tongue, and that children who learn in their mother-tongue in the first years of education build richer language and social skills.

The laws of armed conflict require that “the Occupying Power shall, with the cooperation of the national and local authorities, facilitate the proper working of all institutions devoted to the care and education of children.” For example, the UN General Assembly has condemned Israel’s closure of educational institutions and prohibition of Syrian textbooks in the occupied Golan Heights as violations of the Geneva Conventions. Education for orphans and separated children must be facilitated “in all circumstances” and, as far as possible, “be entrusted to persons of a similar cultural tradition”. The International Committee of the Red Cross explains this rule was established in order “to exclude any religious or political propaganda designed to wean children from their natural milieu; for that would cause add",HIGH,20240620T080000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Ukrainian education officials, teachers, and students",Russian occupying authorities,"Kharkivska, Khersonska, Zaporizka, Donetska, and Luhanska regions of Ukraine",Calls for cessation of Russian education practices in occupied territories and protection of Ukrainian education staff.,Violations of human rights in the education sector and attempts to Russify the education system in occupied territories,Ukraine,Military occupation and efforts to suppress Ukrainian identity

(Nairobi) – The African Union (AU) should work with the United Nations to deploy a civilian protection mission to address ongoing atrocities across Sudan, notably in Darfur, and act to ensure strong human rights investigations, Human Rights Watch said today. The AU Peace and Security Council (PSC) member states meeting on June 21, 2024, should commit to concrete steps to keep civilians safe and ensure accountability as the risk of further atrocities against civilians in El Fasher, North Darfur’s capital, and other conflict-affected areas of the country keep rising.

“The AU Peace and Security Council’s recent request for actions by other AU bodies is a long-awaited positive step to addressing one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises,” said Allan Ngari, Africa advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. “At its next meeting, the Peace and Security Council should spell out what urgent steps it plans to take to ensure the deployment of a United Nations-backed civilian protection mission and to support investigations by the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights.”

The June 21 heads-of-state meeting takes place as the devastating war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and their allies has now gone unabated for 14 months. Both parties have been responsible for serious international humanitarian law violations, including obstruction of aid and sexual abuse. In addition, the RSF and allied forces have carried out deliberate attacks on civilians which amount to crimes against humanity and widespread war crimes against the ethnic Massalit and other non-Arab communities in West Darfur state. As the conflict rages, civilians in other parts of the country are also facing widespread violations. On June 5, an RSF attack on a village in Central Sudan reportedly killed dozens of people, including children. Approximately 10 million people have been displaced due to the conflict, according to the UN.

On May 21, the Peace and Security Council requested that the High-Level Panel on the Resolution of the Conflict in Sudan collaborate with the new AU special envoy for the prevention of genocide, H.E. Adama Dieng, to develop a strategy to stop atrocities and protect civilians. It also expressed grave concern over events in El Fasher, sounding the alarm about the “imminent danger that the escalating conflict poses to civilians, including the increasing likelihood of grave atrocities.” It called on warring parties to lift the siege on the city and guarantee humanitarian access.

At its June 21 meeting, the Peace and Security Council should follow up on requests to and commitments by AU entities. Additionally, it should commit to regular meetings on the situation in Sudan to ensure a prompt development and rollout of a civilian protection plan and investigations by the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights (ACHPR), a quasi-judicial mechanism tasked with promoting and protecting human and collective rights in Africa. The council should prioritize engagement with the UN secretary-general, in accordance with the June 13 UN Security Council resolution 2736 on Sudan, which requested that he, in “consultation” with “regional stakeholders … make further recommendations for the protection of civilians in Sudan.”

Given the scale and nature of the abuses in Darfur, the AU should urgently work with the UN to deploy a civilian protection mission, Human Rights Watch said. Such a mission should be mandated to protect civilians, monitor human rights and international humanitarian law violations, including obstruction of humanitarian aid, and facilitate the safe return of displaced people. The mission should also include a robust and mobile policing unit to focus on locations where civilians are most at risk of deliberate attacks, including in Darfur.

At a June 14 meeting, the Peace and Security Council discussed avenues for funding protection of civilians efforts under the yet-to-be-utilized facility created by UN Security Council resolution 2719, which allows the UN to consider requests from the AU to cover up to 75 percent of an AU-led peace support operation’s annual budget on a case-by-case basis. UN Security Council resolution 2736, which demands that the RSF halt the siege on El Fasher and that all parties ensure civilians are protected, should be translated into immediate concrete collaborative actions with the AU, including supporting the deployment of a civilian protection mission.

The Peace and Security Council also requested the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights to investigate the human rights situation in El Fasher and other areas of Darfur and to propose recommendations to pursue accountability. The ACHPR should urgently act on this and set up an investigation team with the necessary and relevant expertise. The conflict in Sudan has triggered one of the world’s worst displacement crises and has witnessed widespread sexual and gender-based violence. The ACHPR mandate-holders on refugees, asylum seekers, internally displaced persons and migrants in Africa and the rights of women in Africa should bring their thematic expertise to investigation efforts.

The Peace and Security Council and other AU organs should give the investigation team significant financial and high-level political backing to ensure it has the resources and legitimacy to speak authoritatively on the human rights situation in Sudan, Human Rights Watch said.

The AU and international partners should also publicly support the African Commission’s investigations in Sudan and press Sudanese authorities, warring parties, and neighboring countries’ governments to allow investigators to work freely.

Deploying a civilian protection mission and the investigators’ role should be at the heart of discussions when members of the Peace and Security Council travel to Port Sudan to meet with stakeholders as they planned to do on April 18.

The African Commission should coordinate closely with the UN-mandated Independent International Fact-Finding Mission for the Sudan to ensure complementarity and maximize investigation capacities. It should also consider providing the UN Human Rights Council with an update on its work at the September 2024 session, including recommendations to address atrocities. The AU Peace and Security Council should invite the Fact-Finding Mission for a brief over the rights situation in Sudan alongside the ACHPR.

African Commission members should present a public timeline for their investigation work, and regularly report to the Peace and Security Council on its action on Sudan. Its investigation reports should be made public. It should also seek to collaborate with Sudanese civil society, including Sudanese human rights investigators, to provide recommendations on accountability and build on existing investigation efforts.

“The African Union response has failed to mirror the magnitude of events unfolding in Sudan, and yet it has all the tools at its disposal to act to protect civilians,” Ngari said. “AU leaders should demonstrate that they are committed to preventing further atrocities against civilians on the continent.”",VERY HIGH,20240620T193000Z,Human Rights Watch,H.E.

Resolution 46/1 was adopted by the Human Rights Council in 2021 and is due for renewal in September 2024. It mandates the OHCHR Sri Lanka Accountability Project, which gathers evidence of international crimes for use in future prosecutions, as well as ongoing reporting by OHCHR. Renewing the resolution is vital to ensure that perpetrators of international crimes in Sri Lanka can be held accountable, while maintaining international attention on the ongoing crisis.

Forces on both sides of Sri Lanka’s 1983-2009 civil war committed widespread rights abuses and atrocity crimes. Fifteen years since the total defeat of the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in 2009, there has been no accountability, while alleged perpetrators on the government side hold high office, and victim communities continue to face ongoing repression and other violations.

Victim families and communities seeking truth and accountability for enforced disappearances and conflict-era killings are subjected to surveillance and harassment by security and intelligence agencies. Tamil communities in the north and east (which were most affected by the war) face an ongoing campaign of “land-grabbing” by government agencies and the army, which is building Buddhist monuments on Hindu temple sites and driving communities from farmland in an apparent attempt to change the demography of the region. At the same time, new legislation threatens the fundamental rights, including freedoms of expression and association, of all Sri Lankans

When the current president, Ranil Wickremasinghe, was prime minister in 2015, he backed HRC resolution 30/1, which was adopted by consensus, committing Sri Lanka to 25 undertakings across a range of rights issues, including establishing a hybrid justice mechanism to address crimes committed during the civil war. Most of those commitments were never fulfilled. The 2019-2022 administration of Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who had been defense secretary at the end of the war, withdrew from the HRC resolution.

Since becoming president in 2022, Wickremesinghe has opposed the HRC process, seeking to end international scrutiny and attempts to ensure accountability. His government’s repression of victims campaigning for justice, shows that there is currently no political will for a credible domestic accountability process.

Meanwhile, the economic crisis that began in 2022 has plunged millions into poverty. It is widely acknowledged (including by the Supreme Court) that the economic crisis was in large part triggered by corruption, and is part of a larger crisis of misgovernance and impunity. The government has responded by tightening restrictions on civil space across the country. In his March 1 update to the Human Rights Council on the crisis in Sri Lanka, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said he was “concerned by the introduction of new or proposed laws with potentially far-reaching impact on fundamental rights and freedoms … which variously strengthen the executive, grant broad powers to the security forces, and severely restrict rights to freedom of assembly, association and expression, impacting not only on civic space but the business environment.”

Accountability and Justice

In June 2023, President Wickremesinghe announced plans to establish a new truth and reconciliation commission, called the Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation (CTUR), to examine conflict-related rights violations. Six UN special procedures mandate holders said the proposals “appear not to be in compliance with international standards.”

Victims’ and civil society groups said the proposal appeared designed to deflect the attention of the Human Rights Council. They said they had not been properly consulted, and that the new commission would put them at risk of re-traumatization and further threats from security forces.

The government’s ongoing abuses against victims of past violations, their families, and communities, undermined the purported goals of the proposed commission. Those campaigning for truth and accountability were subjected to surveillance and intimidation by the police and intelligence agencies. Events to commemorate Tamil victims of the war were disrupted by the police. Eight special procedures mandate holders criticized the use of counterterrorism legislation to detain people from a memorialization event in November 2023.

Successive Sri Lankan governments have appointed at least 10 commissions since the 1990s to examine human rights violations and war crimes. They collected extensive testimony from victims and witnesses, but none led to accountability or revealed the fate of the disappeared. Instead, the authorities blocked the few criminal investigations into grave abuses that had made some progress in identifying those responsible and initiating prosecutions. Numerous mass graves, usually discovered accidentally, have not been properly examined to identify the victims or the perpetrators. Three special procedures expressed concern at the authorities handling of a mass grave that was discovered in June 2023,

On May 17, the UN Sri Lanka Accountability Project, established by the Human Rights Council to collect evidence of international crimes for use in future prosecutions, published a report on enforced disappearances in Sri Lanka. It found that in the 15 years since the end of the war there has been no “tangible progress in realizing victims’ rights” and therefore “there remains a real risk of recurrence.”

The government Office on Missing Persons, set up in 2017 to trace the disappeared, has made almost no progress. An April UN Human Rights Committee report criticized the agency’s appointment of “individuals implicated in past human rights violations” and its “interference in the prosecution of such cases.” Some government officials implicated in alleged crimes remained politically powerful or hold senior official positions.

The North and East

In the Tamil majority north and east of Sri Lanka, which was most affected by the civil war, government agencies unlawfully occupied property and religious sites of minority Tamil and Muslim communities. In September 2023, a judge from Mullaitivu district resigned and fled the country after receiving death threats following a ruling he handed down against the Department of Archaeology, which had constructed a Buddhist monument on the site of a Hindu temple.

In a recent instance, eight Tamil Hindu worshippers, detained by police while performing rituals in March 2024, were held for 10 days and allegedly abused. They were arrested at the Veddukkunaari temple near Vavuniya, one of numerous temple sites in northeastern Sri Lanka claimed by nationalist Buddhist monks, frequently with the support of government agencies and the security forces.

Civil Society Space

Restrictions on civic space, which are most intense in the north and east, have continued and perhaps intensified under the presidency of Ranil Wickremesinghe. Tamil activists and victims, including the mothers of the disappeared, are routinely subject to surveillance and harassment.

President Wickremesinghe ended his predecessor’s moratorium on the use of the notorious Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), using it to detain student activists protesting for economic rights as well as Tamils commemorating war dead. Meanwhile, the Anti-Terrorism Bill currently before parliament, which is supposed to replace the PTA, contains draconian new powers to give the president, police, and military broad scope to detain people without evidence, makes vaguely defined forms of speech a criminal offense, and arbitrarily bans gatherings and organizations without meaningful judicial oversight.

The Online Safety Act, adopted by parliament in January 2024, purportedly provides protections against online harassment, abuse, and fraud. Instead, it is mostly concerned with creating a new Online Safety Commission, appointed by the president, that can decide what online speech is “false” or “harmful,” remove content, restrict and prohibit internet access, and prosecute individuals and organizations. The UN OHCHR said the law “could potentially criminalize nearly all forms of legitimate expression, creating an environment that has a chilling effect on freedom of expression.” Three special procedures mandate holders said “the proposed legislation will give immense powers to [the authorities]… and could be in violation of the basic principles of freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association and the right to privacy.”

A draft law to regulate non-governmental organizations, circulated by the government in January, could make it impossible for civil society organizations to function freely, despite the critical role of civil society in addressing the worst impacts of the economic crisis, and providing scrutiny that seeks to promote good governance and combat corruption. The bill does not address any evident need, but instead seeks to subject civil society organizations to invasive government scrutiny and interference and threatens civil society members with prison if they do not comply with cumbersome administrative procedures.",HIGH,20240621T161500Z,Victim families and communities,"President Ranil Wickremesinghe, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk",Sri Lankan Government,Northern and Eastern Sri Lanka,"Renewal of Resolution 46/1, adherence to international human rights standards, protection of civil society",Widespread rights abuses and failure to provide accountability for past crimes,Sri Lanka,"Historical civil conflict, government impunity, corruption"

Russian authorities are imposing the Russian curriculum and Kremlin propaganda in Ukrainian schools in occupied areas, and have retaliated against school workers if they refuse to implement the imposed Russian curriculum.

Russia should cease all measures to Russify Ukraine’s education system; Ukrainian authorities and foreign donors should work with civil society to keep children connected to learning under occupation or during displacement.

to keep children connected to learning under occupation or during displacement. The laws of war require an occupying power to restore services in the occupied territory but prohibit it from imposing its own laws, including on education.

(Kyiv, June 20, 2024) – Russian authorities are suppressing the Ukrainian language and curriculum, imposing the Russian curriculum, anti-Ukrainian propaganda, and Russian as the language of instruction in schools in areas of Ukraine that Russia is occupying, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. These measures violate the laws of armed conflict, which prohibit an occupying power from making unnecessary changes to laws in the occupied territory, as well as international human rights standards on the right to education.

The 66-page report “Education under Occupation: Forced Russification of the School System in Occupied Ukrainian Territories,” documents violations of international law by the Russian authorities in relation to the right to education in formerly occupied areas of Ukraine’s Kharkivska region, and other regions that remain under Russian occupation. Russian authorities have forced changes to the curriculum and retaliated against school staff who refused to make such changes with threats, detention, and even torture. Human Rights Watch also found that occupying authorities threatened parents whose children were learning the Ukrainian curriculum online.

“Russia should stop denying Ukrainian children their right to education as guaranteed to them under international law,” said Bill Van Esveld, associate children’s rights director at Human Rights Watch. “It should immediately cease attempts to Russify the education system and to carry out political indoctrination in occupied territories of Ukraine.”

Human Rights Watch interviewed 42 educators, school staff, and other officials in Kharkivska region after Russian forces left the area in September 2022, and interviewed teachers who had been displaced or escaped from the areas of Khersonska, Zaporizka, Donetska, and Luhanska regions that are currently under occupation.

Ukrainian experts estimate that one million school-age Ukrainian children remain in Russian-occupied territory. Data that the Ukrainian Ministry of Education and Science provided Human Rights Watch indicate that more than 62,400 children living in occupied areas continue to study in Ukrainian secondary education institutions remotely.

The laws of war require an occupying power to restore public order and services in the occupied territory, including to facilitate the proper education of children, but it must respect the laws in force in the territory before the occupation, and is prohibited from imposing its own laws, including laws on education.

The Russian school curriculum imposed in occupied areas of Ukraine includes history textbooks that justify Russia’s invasion, portrays Ukraine under its current government as a “neo-Nazi state,” and strictly limits instruction in the Ukrainian language. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child guarantees children’s right to an education that develops respect for the child’s “own cultural identity, language and values,” as well as the “national values” of the child’s country of origin. Russia’s imposition of changes to education in occupied territories also violates other international human rights standards, including the prohibition against propaganda for war, the child’s right to mother-tongue education, and parents’ right of choice regarding their children’s education.

Ukrainian children under occupation also receive military training as part of the school curriculum. The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine reported that Russian authorities require secondary schools in occupied Ukrainian territory to share the names of students ages 18 and older, whom the Russian authorities deem eligible to be drafted into the Russian armed forces.

Human Rights Watch found that occupying authorities retaliate against anyone, including in schools, who criticizes the invasion. Russian authorities and their proxies punished distance learning or teaching of the Ukrainian curriculum and threatened parents with fines, loss of custody of their children, and detention if they did not enroll their children in “Russian” schools, or if their children studied the Ukrainian curriculum remotely.

Occupying authorities also used coercion, detention, ill-treatment, and torture to pressure Ukrainian teachers to work with them or to hand over students’ files and other school data. The report documents the week-long detention, in dire conditions, of a school principal from Borivske village in Kharkivska region, whom security officers beat repeatedly for refusing to hand over information about his school.

In addition to the occupying authorities’ specific abuses, Russia’s full-scale invasion has placed a range of pressures on Ukraine’s education system, such as barriers to online learning, the burgeoning need for mental health support for students and teachers, and a negative impact on students with disabilities.

The report also documents the Ukrainian authorities’ problematic use of the criminal offence of “collaboration” against Ukrainian education staff who worked under Russian occupation, even though some teachers had to work under occupation to survive.

A letter from the Education Ministry to the heads of educational institutions and other officials in September 2022, which Human Rights Watch examined, warned educational workers that working in any managerial, teaching, or research position under the occupying authorities is “categorically unacceptable” and warrants a “severe” criminal penalty, even though occupying authorities used threats and violence to coerce educators to work in schools.

The laws of war do not directly address wartime collaboration but prohibit occupying forces from exercising coercion against civilians who are not their own nationals, anticipating occupying forces’ efforts to do so. They also require the occupying power to facilitate the proper working of institutions dedicated to the education of children, with the cooperation of the national and local authorities.

Given the context of occupation and teachers’ responsibilities to educate children, Human Rights Watch believes Ukrainian authorities should not penalize teachers in occupied territories solely for providing education to children under the Russian curriculum, and should revise their overly broad view of the offense of collaboration.

Ukrainian authorities and foreign donors should work with Ukrainian civil society groups to find ways to keep children connected to learning under occupation or during displacement by Russian forces, Human Rights Watch said.

“Russian authorities should ensure that education in occupied territories of Ukraine follows Ukrainian curricula and Ukrainian law,” Van Esveld said. “They should hold to account all occupation officials responsible for harassing, ill-treating, and putting undue pressure on Ukrainian education workers, students, and parents.”",HIGH,20240620T050000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Bill Van Esveld, Ukrainian Ministry of Education and Science",Russian authorities,"Occupied areas of Ukraine, specifically Kharkivska region","Russian authorities should cease indoctrination efforts, Ukrainian authorities should revise penalization policies for educators",Imposition of Russian curriculum and suppression of Ukrainian language and education,Ukraine,"Russian occupation of Ukrainian territories, political indoctrination policies"

Since seizing power in 2022, Burkina Faso’s military authorities have suspended media outlets and harassed and intimidated journalists, including by threatening to conscript them into the armed forces.

On June 18, Idrissa Ouédraogo, head of the Superior Council for Communication (Conseil supérieur de la communication) announced the suspension of TV5 for six months for airing an interview the previous day with Newton Ahmed Barry, former head of the Burkinabé electoral commission and critic of the military junta, on the country’s security situation. Ouédraogo accused TV5 of “tendentious remarks bordering on disinformation” and “minimizing efforts” by the security forces to “reconquer the national territory.” He also imposed a fine on TV5 of 50 million CFA francs (US$82,000).

Since early this year, the security situation in Burkina Faso has sharply deteriorated with a surge in violence by Islamist armed groups and multiple abusive counterterrorism operations by government forces. On June 12, the al-Qaeda-affiliated Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims (Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wa al-Muslimeen, JNIM) claimed responsibility for an attack on a military base in Mansila, Sahel region that killed more than 100 soldiers. The JNIM fighters also killed several civilians and looted civilian property, according to reports.

In April, the communication council suspended TV5 and several other media outlets for two weeks after they reported on a Human Rights Watch report finding the military committed crimes against humanity against civilians in Yatenga province. The council also blocked Human Rights Watch’s website.

While governments may place restrictions on the media for national security reasons, international human rights law provides that these restrictions must be grounded in law, strictly necessary for a legitimate purpose, and not overbroad. They may not be used to suppress or withhold information of legitimate public interest.

Burkina Faso experienced an upsurge in attacks on students, teachers and schools in 2022 and 2023, according to a report released today by the Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack (GCPEA), a partner organization of Human Rights Watch.

The report cited over 270 attacks on schools across the country in 2022 and 2023, a sharp increase from previous years, with GCPEA recording 148 attacks in 2021 and 2020. GCPEA identified 99 attacks on schools in 2022, which reportedly destroyed 31 schools and damaged at least 53 more. More than half the attacks involved arson. GCPEA said the majority of attacks were attributed to armed groups.

The report includes findings from Human Rights Watch, which extensively documented education-related attacks by Islamist armed groups in Burkina Faso between 2017 and 2020. These armed groups have killed, beaten, abducted, and threatened education professionals; intimidated students; terrorized parents into keeping children out of school; and damaged, destroyed, and looted schools.

Fighting between the Burkina Faso armed forces and the Al-Qaeda-linked Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims (Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wa al-Muslimeen) and the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara has expanded since the Islamist armed groups entered the country from Mali in 2016. Both sides have been responsible for grave abuses.

The conflict has led to the forced displacement of over two million people and the deaths of thousands of civilians. In October 2023, the United Nations reported that one million children in Burkina Faso were out of school. A report by the Norwegian Refugee Council last June found that, with over 6,100 schools shut by spring 2023, Burkina Faso “was home to nearly half of all closed schools in Central and West Africa.”

GCPEA identified at least 11 incidents of schools being used by government forces, militias and armed groups for military purposes across Burkina Faso in 2022 and 2023. The military use of schools, such as converting them into bases, denies students access and puts them at risk of attack.

In 2017, Burkina Faso endorsed the Safe Schools Declaration, a political agreement committing countries to prevent and respond to attacks on students, teachers, and schools.

On a roadside in Central Uganda, a woman selling charcoal says she barely earns enough to buy food for herself and her eight children. She is determined for her children to go to school and says she believes that pre-primary education is an essential foundation for further learning. But the tuition is expensive.

Despite scholarships for some of her children, she has gone 1 million shillings (US$263) into debt paying their fees and has no idea how she will repay it. She is not alone—millions of parents borrow to pay education fees.

The Ugandan government provides free primary and secondary education but pre-primary education is left to private providers. Families often pay a significant portion of their income to cover fees, but most can't afford it. At some urban pre-primary schools, fees are higher than the tuition for an engineering degree at Uganda's largest public university.

Over the past two years, the Initiative for Social and Economic Rights (ISER) and Human Rights Watch have researched access to pre-primary education in Uganda, interviewing over 100 parents, teachers, children, and education officials around the country. Many parents described the insurmountable barriers they faced due to the lack of government-funded pre-primary education.

Extensive research shows that pre-primary education has profound benefits for children throughout their lives. It boosts their educational attainment, health, and employment prospects. Brain development is at its highest in early childhood, so this is a critical time for learning.

A cost-benefit analysis of pre-primary education in Uganda concluded that ""investments in early childhood have the greatest rate of return of any human capital intervention.""

More than half of the world's countries now provide at least one year of free pre-primary education, and the number is growing.

Last year, Sierra Leone adopted a law guaranteeing all children 13 years of free education, beginning with one year of free pre-primary. Madagascar adopted a law in 2022 providing one year of free and compulsory pre-primary education. Ghana has guaranteed two years of free and compulsory pre-primary education since 2008; Benin has offered two free years since 2006. Gabon provides three free years.

Some governments express skepticism about providing pre-primary education because of the cost. However, research shows that pre-primary education virtually pays for itself. In Uganda, for example, almost 90 percent of the cost could be covered just through reducing repetition rates and inefficiencies at the primary level.

Many parents enroll their children in primary school before the usual age of 6 because they cannot afford preschool fees. This creates overcrowded classrooms, overwhelmed teachers, and high repetition rates.

We saw this recently at a school outside Kampala, where a teacher told us that in the primary 1 class, at least 30 of the 120 students were under the entry age of 6, and that some were only 4. He also said that 40 percent of the class would likely repeat the grade.

Overcrowding is worse in rural areas where preschools are scarce, and families have less money to pay fees. Some primary classes have more than 250 children.

According to the World Bank, every dollar invested in pre-primary education can yield up to $14 in benefits. It boosts tax revenues and GDP by improving children's employment prospects and earnings, and enabling parents—especially mothers—to increase their income by returning to work sooner. It also reduces public service expenditures in law enforcement, medical care, and the justice system, and reduces rates of child marriage, child labor, and teenage pregnancy.

Sierra Leone has made free education a priority not only for its own children, but for children globally. Together with Luxembourg and the Dominican Republic, it is proposing a new international treaty to guarantee at least one year of free pre-primary and free secondary education for all children. Current international treaties—dating back decades—only guarantee free primary education.

Governments at the United Nations Human Rights Council will decide next month whether to begin treaty negotiations. Meetings begin in Geneva tomorrow. All governments should support this important proposal. In today's world, a primary education alone is insufficient for children to thrive.

The African Union's Agenda 2063, a blueprint for inclusive and sustainable socio-economic development, calls for investments in education, including universal early childhood development. The complementary Continental Education Strategy for Africa, recognizes pre-primary education as ""the pillar on which future learning and training are grounded.""

The African Union declared 2024 the Year of Education. This is the time to accelerate access to education for all children, including pre-primary. No child's access should be limited by their family's economic situation. Free quality education, from pre-primary through secondary, creates a better future not only for children, but for all.

Although Kazakhstan’s new mass media law has some amendments that should improve the status quo, its ambiguity and the restrictive nature of other provisions threaten to create obstacles to the work of local and foreign journalists.

The law, which President Kassym-Jomart Tokaev signed on June 19, supersedes the laws on media and on television and radio broadcasting.

The improvements include a reduction from three years to one on the limitation period for claims to be made against media for inaccurate information and a shortening of the statutory consideration period for “information owners” to respond to media inquiries to five working days from seven. The introduction of a definition for a “special status of a journalist,” apparently aimed at increased legal guarantees and protections for journalists, could also prove positive.

But before the law was adopted, national and international media experts raised concerns about the draft’s other restrictive proposals, calling on the Kazakh government to revise or withdraw it. Although some controversial provisions were eliminated, several others remain.

For example, the law expands the definition of mass media to include online publications, obliging them to be registered with an authorized government body and have a physical presence in Kazakhstan. It also grants the government expansive power to interfere with and suspend the work of foreign journalists by denying foreign media registration if their materials contain “propaganda of extremism.” Meanwhile, Kazakhstan maintains a vague and overbroad definition of “extremism,” which is used abusively to punish legitimate, protected speech. The law forbids the professional activities of foreign media and foreign journalists without “appropriate accreditation,” a provision the government can use as a tool to deny, suspend, or withdraw accreditation to journalists and media critical of the authorities.

Furthermore, the law empowers a relevant authority to carry out “mass media monitoring;” in other words, to surveil all media to ensure they comply with national legislation and do not violate “national, cultural, and family values,” which have not been defined. This provision may potentially lead to greater self-censorship among journalists and restrict the topics they can report on.

Kazakhstan’s international partners should remind the country’s authorities to uphold their commitments to respect free speech and urge them to bring the new law in line with international standards.",HIGH,20240623T024500Z,national and international media experts,President Kassym-Jomart Tokaev,Kazakh government,Kazakhstan,Revise or withdraw restrictive provisions to align with international standards,Restrictive provisions in new mass media law threaten freedom of expression and media freedom,Kazakhstan,Desire for control over media and suppression of dissent

On June 23, armed militants—apparently supporters of the Islamic State (ISIS)—attacked the two largest cities in Dagestan, in Russia’s North Caucasus region. By day’s end, a church and a synagogue were in flames and a Russian Orthodox priest killed in Derbent, and in Makhachkala, Dagestan’s capital, a church and a police checkpoint near a synagogue were attacked. At least 15 law enforcement personnel and four local residents were killed, and dozens were wounded.

Experts widely link the attacks to failings on the part of security services and the federal government in addressing domestic threats amidst Russia’s war in Ukraine.

In November 2023, Russian authorities failed to prevent or adequately respond to antisemitic mob attacks in Dagestan and other regions of the North Caucasus. Those acts included the takeover of the Makhachkala airport by a mob hunting for Israeli passengers on a flight from Tel Aviv; an attack on a hotel after false rumors it was housing “Israeli refugees”; an arson attack on a Jewish community center under construction; and the use of antisemitic language by protesters at two pro-Palestine rallies.

Russia’s authorities should ensure an effective investigation capable of identifying those responsible for Sunday’s horrific attacks and holding them accountable, while fulfilling their responsibility to protect people from militant attacks.

But will they do so in a way that respects human rights?

Authorities’ response to the monstrous attack in March on a concert hall in the outskirts of Moscow, in which militants killed at least 140 people and ISIS claimed responsibility, show otherwise. Russian authorities tortured and shared recordings of the torture of at least two men of Tajik origin held as suspects for the crime. Security services followed up with abusive raids against Tajiks and other Central Asian migrants. Many faced arbitrary dismissals from jobs, physical intimidation accompanied by anti-migrant slurs and slogans, and xenophobic violence, including destruction of migrant-owned property, beatings by groups of people, and attacks with pepper spray and knives.

For over two decades, Russian authorities have been intermittently battling militant Islamist insurgencies in Dagestan. Their response has included abduction-style detentions, enforced disappearances, torture, and forcible displacement of local residents.

In responding to this week’s attacks, Russian authorities should uphold their human rights obligations instead of perpetuating a climate of lawlessness and impunity for abuses.

In September 2022, at least 23 schools and kindergartens in southwestern Kyrgyzstan were attacked during a short but violent border conflict between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Some schools were damaged by shrapnel, and at least one was used as a military base by Tajik armed forces. Fifty-three other schools were converted into shelters to accommodate families as an estimated 140,000 people were displaced.

The education of more than 130,000 students was disrupted as 161 schools across the Batken and Osh regions were temporarily closed, according to the United Nations, with some children suffering psychosocial trauma.

In Tajikistan, according to Human Rights Watch’s report on the conflict, at least one school was burned down, affecting 450 children, and a teacher was reportedly killed as he attempted to protect his students during the hostilities.

These attacks were included in the report, Education under Attack 2024, by the Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack (GCPEA), a coalition of UN agencies and partner organization to Human Rights Watch. The report found attacks on education rose by almost 20 percent in 2022 and 2023 compared to the previous two years. Government forces around the world, like those in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, have occupied educational facilities, targeted schools and kindergartens with military weaponry, and burned, damaged, and destroyed buildings, forcing their closure and leading to months of lost learning.

Currently, of the 23 schools and kindergartens that have been damaged in Kyrgyzstan, at least 21 were rebuilt and reopened, with the government planning to build 34 new schools and kindergartens in the region.

Over the last seven years, there have been more than 20 border clashes between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, as the border continues to be contested following a failure to fully demarcate it after the two countries’ independence in 1991. At least six children were killed in the last two clashes of 2021 and 2022, with dozens more injured.

Although Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are reported to have made significant progress in border demarcation since 2022, neither government has endorsed the Safe Schools Declaration, a commitment to protect education in armed conflict. The declaration commits countries to taking steps to safeguard education, including upholding international humanitarian and human rights law and using the Guidelines for Protecting Schools and Universities from Military Use During Armed Conflict.

Houthis have since the end of May arbitrarily arrested dozens of civil society and UN staff without due process, and have held them incommunicado, amounting to enforced disappearance .

and UN staff without due process, and have held them incommunicado, amounting to . These detentions followed Yemeni government’s decision to move major banks out of Houthi-controlled territory. Houthis have a history of using detainees as bargaining chips.

Houthis should immediately release everyone arbitrarily detained. The international community should pressure the Houthis to release the detainees and cease their broader crackdown on civil society.

(Amman) – Houthi security forces have, since May 31, 2024, arrested and forcibly disappeared dozens of people, including at least 13 United Nations staff and many employees of nongovernmental organizations operating in Houthi-controlled territories, Human Rights Watch said today. The arbitrary arrests appear to be based on the detainees’ present or past employment.

The Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah, carried out these arbitrary arrests while widespread hunger and thirst remain rampant across Yemen, including in areas they control, and during a recent, major cholera outbreak that the Houthis hid for several months, based on ongoing Human Rights Watch research.

“The Houthis are using arbitrary detentions and enforced disappearances as a political tool at a time when the people living in their territories lack even the most basic needs,” said Niku Jafarnia, Yemen and Bahrain researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The Houthis should immediately release all of these people, many of whom have spent their careers working to improve their country.”

Human Rights Watch spoke to 20 people with knowledge of the arrests, as well as 4 Yemen analysts. Their identities are not being revealed for their safety, as they fear reprisals. Human Rights Watch also reviewed documents, videos, social media, and media reports, voice recordings, and other materials relevant to the detentions.

Houthi forces did not present search or arrest warrants at the time of arrest, and the authorities have refused to tell families where those arrested are being held, meaning that these acts amount to enforced disappearances. They have held detainees incommunicado, without access to lawyers or their families. On June 19, Human Rights Watch wrote to the Houthi human rights office with questions regarding the arrests and concerns about the apparent absence of any due process. The Houthis have not responded.

As far as Human Rights Watch has been able to determine, no charges have been brought against the people detained. However, Houthi authorities have a long history of bringing dubious charges against detained people, including espionage.

Starting on June 10, Houthi authorities released a series of videos and curated social media posts on the Houthi-affiliated TV channel, Al-Masirah, and its related social media platforms. These show 10 Yemeni men who were detained between 2021 and 2023. Most of them have been held incommunicado.

The videos show the men confessing that they were spying for the United States and Israel, but there is a high risk that these confessions were coerced. Human Rights Watch has previously documented the Houthis’ use of torture to obtain confessions. Publishing videos of confessions undermines the right to fair trial and lacks credibility.

Though the Houthis have not said whether the current arrests are linked to the videos and their related announcements of uncovering a “spy network,” sources, including analysts, said that they feared that the Houthis were trying to frame the recently detained people as spies.

Yemen analysts interviewed by Human Rights Watch also suggested political motives for the arrests. The Yemeni government-controlled central bank issued a decision on May 30 to end transactions with six banks within Houthi territories that refused to move their headquarters to Aden, which is under the control of the Yemeni government and the Southern Transitional Council (STC). The decision has the potential for a significant negative economic impact on Houthi-controlled territories. Analysts said that the arrests may be an attempt to put pressure on the Yemeni government to reverse the decision.

Enforced disappearances, in which the authorities detain a person and then refuse to acknowledge their whereabouts or situation when asked, are serious crimes under international law and are prohibited at all times under both international human rights law and international humanitarian law.

All of the detainees are Yemenis. The Houthis have told families not to speak out about the detention of their family members, in many cases saying that detainees will be released as soon as the Houthis have completed their interrogations, as long as they do not find anything.

“[The Houthis] know there will not be an [international] escalation from the arrest of the Yemenis, but if they arrested international staff there will be a huge escalation from the international community,” said one source.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, have called for the release of all UN and nongovernmental organization staff, as have other senior UN officials.

However, some sources also told Human Rights Watch that the UN agencies or organizations where detainees had been working had not made efforts to contact detainees’ families, including those living abroad who could have been safely reached. “Continuing to work like business as usual cannot be done,” a source said. “The abductees that were part of the confessions yesterday, there was no huge demand for their release, barely anything was said by UN agencies,” referring to those shown in videos.

One political analyst said that “[T]he wider weak international reaction … proves that from [the Houthis’] perspective, they did the right thing.”

It is imperative for the United Nations, independent groups working in Yemen, and concerned governments to take every action in their power to ensure the release of those detained, Human Rights watch said. Oman, which has been a mediator in negotiations between the Houthis and other warring parties, should work with other countries collectively to ensure that the Houthis release the detainees.

“The international community should be doing everything in their power to ensure that these people are immediately released,” Jafarnia said. “Many of them have been invaluable members of Yemeni civil society organizations and staff in UN agencies and nongovernmental international groups.”

Based on interviews with informed sources, Human Rights Watch found that, starting on the morning of Friday, May 31, Houthi forces began arresting employees of several nongovernmental organizations, raiding their homes and offices, though a few arrests were before that date. According to one source, more than 60 people had been arrested as of June 12.

In one case, the Houthis also detained the husband and two children – a 3-year-old and a 9-month-old – of a woman who works with a civil society organization, a source said.

In all but one case, Houthi forces did not tell relatives where they were taking the person arrested, and none have had contact with their family members since they were arrested, as far as Human Rights Watch could determine. With the exception of one case, the authorities did not tell relatives where their loved ones have been detained when asked. Such conditions amount to enforced disappearance.

On June 18, Volker Türk said that the six staff members from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) who had been detained “have not had contact with their families, nor has the UN been able to access them.” In separate statements, he added that two other staff, who have been “held incommunicado, without any due process,” and two staff from the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), had “already been arbitrarily detained for a lengthy period.”

“I can’t even describe the fear and concern that all of these people had for their safety and well-being,” one source said. “[The head of one organization] couldn’t eat for an entire week.”

While the conditions of those disappeared remains unknown, many sources said that the Houthis had not allowed family members to send needed medicines for the detainees, including for serious medical conditions. Human Rights Watch has documented the Houthis’ use of torture in detention since 2015.

Since the initial raids and arrests on May 31 and June 6, the Houthis have continued arresting people, prompting many people in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen to flee their territory.

One person who left Sanaa said, “Although I managed to flee.… I couldn’t sleep … I’ve had panic attacks every day since I fled from Sanaa … I’m very worr[ied] about my friends and colleagues in Sanaa who are just waiting for Houthis to arrest them.”

Since late 2014, when Houthi forces occupied Sanaa, and much of Yemen, Houthis have detained and forcibly disappeared hundreds of people. Many organizations, including Human Rights Watch, have documented the Houthis’ use of torture in detention.

The Houthis are not alone in these violations. Throughout the conflict, all parties have carried out enforced disappearances and arbitrary arrests. Men and women have been targeted for their political and religious beliefs, or their membership in a religious or political group. Journalists, other media professionals, aid workers, and human rights defenders have also been targeted.

Some have been given grossly unfair trials on trumped-up or abusive charges and have been effectively used as bargaining chips to exchange detainees. Many have been held incommunicado, tortured, and subjected to cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment.

Unlawful House Raids, Arbitrary Arrests

Human Rights Watch documented the cases of 31 people – nearly all employees of national and international nongovernmental organizations and the UN – arrested by Houthi security forces between May 31 and June 12. Sources tracking the arrests say the total number of such arrests is well over 60, and possibly much higher.

As far as Human Rights Watch has been able to determine in the cases documented, none of the security forces presented arrest or search warrants, although in at least two cases they appeared to produce a substitute legal justification for the arrest. Arresting a person without a warrant and clear charges is a violation under Article 132 of the Yemeni Criminal Procedures Law.

The cases Human Rights Watch reviewed followed a similar pattern. Houthi forces arrived unannounced at the homes of those they were aiming to arrest with several armored vehicles and an average of about 10 to 30 armed men. Often, two or three women from the Zaynabiyat, the Houthis’ female militia, accompanied the forces. Almost all forces were wearing military uniforms and head and face coverings, sometimes with only their eyes showing. In many cases, the forces arrived early in the morning while families were still asleep.

Houthi forces would bang on the door, and once the door was open, they would immediately enter the homes and take family members into different rooms. In many cases, forces pulled the person they wanted to arrest into a separate room and interrogated them. While some forces were conducting interrogations, other forces raided the home, one room at a time, taking laptops, hard drives, cell phones, documents, and in some cases cash, cars, and other items.

In most of the cases, when the individual arrested was a male, female relatives were also present. Despite the presence of the Zaynabiyat , in many cases the forces did not respect cultural norms, with male forces staying in the same room as the female relatives, and raiding the women’s and girls’ rooms as well, the sources said. Male forces sometimes entered homes where women lived without providing them the opportunity to cover themselves.

In most cases, the raids and interrogations lasted several hours.

In several cases, sources said that Houthi forces had a cameraman with them. “They were working according to a certain script … they were looking for details that had any ties with any international actors,” said one source. “They went through all of their photographs and took photographs of any pictures they had [with “Western”-looking individuals].”

Enforced Disappearances, Denial of Access to Lawyers and Family Members

In all but one case documented, Houthi authorities have not provided any information about the whereabouts of the people they arrested when asked, amounting to enforced disappearance. In several cases, sources said, family members tried contacting Houthi authorities to find out where their family member had been taken, or to try to communicate with them, but were refused.

None of those detained have been allowed access to a lawyer, and lawyers that families hired were denied access to those detained when they tried to reach out to Houthi authorities.

“We just want a phone call,” a family member of one detainee said. “We know he’ll be held for a long time. We just want a phone call from him to say that he’s ok.""

Many families have not been allowed to bring needed medicines for their detained relatives’ medical conditions.

History of Torture, Forced Confessions

Because Houthi authorities are holding the detainees incommunicado, Human Rights Watch has been unable to document detainee conditions, apart from the lack of access to needed medications for at least some of those detained. However, torture is a serious concern given that Human Rights Watch has documented torture of detainees in recent years by the Houthis.

In 2018, Human Rights Watch found that Houthi officials routinely treated detainees brutally, often in ways amounting to torture. Former detainees described Houthi officers beating them with iron rods, wooden sticks, and assault rifles. Guards whipped prisoners, shackled them to walls, caned their feet, and threatened to rape them or their family members, former detainees said. Several people described being hung from a wall by their arms shackled behind them as one of the most painful techniques.

The UN Panel of Experts on Yemen and rights groups have continued to document the Houthis’ use of torture since 2018. In their 2023 report, the panel reported that “Houthi-held prisoners are subjected to systematic psychological and physical torture, including the denial of medical intervention to cure the injuries caused by the torture inflicted, which for some prisoners resulted in permanent disabilities and death.”

Starting on June 10, the Houthis began publishing and broadcasting videos showing 10 earlier detainees “confessing” to espionage. Many of the individuals who spoke to Human Rights Watch expressed fears that the videos. along with statements by the Houthis that they had uncovered a “spy network,” would be used as justification for the recent spate of arrests and disappearances.

In the fall of 2021, Houthi rebels arrested former Yemeni employees of the US embassy in Yemen, all of whom, outside of one who died in detention, are still being held in arbitrary detention without access to their families or to lawyers. In May 2022, the US Mission to Yemen released a statement regarding the death of Abdulhameed al-Ajami, a former employee who had been held incommunicado since November 2021 and died in Houthi detention.

The 10 men who appeared in the videos appear to include some of these US embassy employees. In many cases, this was the first time their families had seen or heard from them since they had been arrested.

The so-called evidence shown in the videos accusing them of being spies included letters of recommendation from their current or former employers, including the US embassy in Yemen, citing the projects they had worked on, and recommending them for future employment and visas. Human Rights Watch could not confirm the veracity of the documents, but they do not appear to contain evidence of espionage.

Human Rights Watch and other groups, including the former UN Group of Eminent Experts on Yemen, have documented the Houthis’ use of torture to obtain information or confessions. In their 2020 report,, the experts said that they had “verified that 14 men and 1 boy had been subjected to torture, including sexual violence in eight cases, to extract written confessions or punish them while levelling accusations of affiliations to different political and military groups.”

In a statement on June 14, Commissioner Volker Türk stressed that “the public broadcasting on 10 and 12 June of statements procured under circumstances of inherent duress from our colleague, detained incommunicado, and others detained since 2021 is totally unacceptable, and itself violates their human rights.”

Broader Humanitarian Crisis and Houthi Crackdown on Civil Society

Many sources said that the Houthis’ recent arrests are also a means to distract attention from their increasing failure to provide people living in their territories with basic necessities, as well as the government’s recent decision to move banking from Sanaa to Aden.

In November 2023, after several years of failed negotiations, the World Food Programme (WFP) decided to “pause” humanitarian aid to Houthi-controlled areas. According to several people in the humanitarian sector in Yemen, the Houthis had been controlling the lists of beneficiaries and in some cases were using humanitarian aid to recruit fighters and children to Houthi forces. Many other aid organizations say that they have struggled to maintain their operations in Houthi-controlled territories because of the extensive restrictions and attempts by Houthi authorities to control their programs.

Others believe that, in addition to the pressure over banking, the arrests are part of a wider crackdown on civic space in their territories, and a desire to have complete control over all aspects of life, including humanitarian aid, education, health, and corporate profit.

“The closure and complete shutdown of civic space in their areas has been going on for a long time,” one source said.

Since the Houthis took over Sanaa in 2014, they have carried out significant violations of women’s rights and freedoms, have repressed freedom of speech and assembly, and have detained dozens of journalists, human rights defenders, academics, and political opponents.

The Houthis have also tried to achieve control of many sectors across their territories, from educational institutions to private companies to humanitarian organizations.

“[The Houthis previously] took over Nama’a Bank, Science and Technology Hospital, Azal University, Al-Nasser University, the Emirates University, Sabafon telecommunication company, and hundreds of other institutions that they seized and gave to their people to run,” one source said.

Describing the arrests of the staff of two pharmaceutical companies on June 9, a political analyst told Human Rights Watch that: “This isn't just the medical company sector. We saw this in many economic sectors inside of Sanaa too, either banking sector, factory sector, etc. The Houthis are trying to have their own say on the economic circles, especially in the private sectors, and want to own their own institutions or want people who are 100 percent loyal to them to be owning them.”

Another source described that the Houthis’ recent arrests would result in a greater “brain drain” than had already occurred over the last 10 years of conflict.

A Yemeni person living abroad said: “It's almost as if our life in Yemen is over after this. I thought I would move back and start a family there, and now it’s clear to me I can’t do that. We can’t live like this.”",HIGH,20240626T051500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Niku Jafarnia (researcher, Human Rights Watch), Volker Türk (UN high commissioner for human rights)",Houthis,Houthi-controlled territories in Yemen,"Immediate release of arbitrarily detained individuals, international pressure on the Houthis, support for families of detainees",Arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearances of civil society members and UN staff,Yemen,"Political motives linked to control over civil society, economic decisions by the Yemeni government, and deteriorating humanitarian conditions"

Over 1,300 Muslim pilgrims reportedly died during the annual Hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca, this month in Saudi Arabia, where temperatures have soared beyond 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit).

Unmitigated exposure to extreme heat can cause a range of known health harms including organ failure and even death. Heat stress is believed to have caused many of the deaths, a completely preventable event. This reinforces the need for stronger heat protection measures, especially for groups particularly vulnerable to heat stress like older people and people with disabilities.

Unregistered pilgrims were reportedly deprived access to public facilities like air-conditioned tents, misting centers, transportation, or water rehydration areas. High official Hajj costs are considered a primary factor driving unregistered status, with many tour companies sending pilgrims without Hajj permits on mandatory personal visit visas. Authorities have also emphasized that “83 percent of [the dead] did not have permits, meaning they were exposed to long distances and periods under the sun without shelter.…”

However, Saudi authorities have an obligation to protect people’s health from known hazards like extreme heat, which the climate crisis is only making more frequent and intense. Beyond Hajj, they should implement heat protection measures to better safeguard the health of all those at risk.

This is especially urgent given Saudi Arabia’s plans under Vision 2030, which includes increasing the annual number of religious pilgrims to 30 million from 8 million, and holding mega-events in sports and music that could entail extreme heat exposure.

Saudi Arabia also hosts millions of migrant workers who carry out the vast majority of outdoor work and are exposed to extreme heat amid inadequate protections. There are multiple planned “giga-projects” that will rely on this a huge migrant workforce. This includes FIFA’s 2034 Men’s World Cup, which Saudi Arabia – as the sole bidder – is expected to host;, the estimated US$500 billion NEOM city;, the US$50 billion Red Sea project;, and the US$200 billion Al Qiddiya projects. To protect migrant workers, Saudi Arabia should implement risk-based measures such for environmental heat and strenuous work commonly assessed commonly by the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) to impose proper work-rest schedules.

Next year’s Hajj, too, will occur during the summer.

(Beirut) – Iraqi authorities in Baghdad and Erbil have arbitrarily detained and deported Syrians to Damascus and to parts of northeast Syria under the control of Kurdish-led forces, Human Rights Watch said today. Iraqi authorities have deported some Syrians even though they possessed official Iraqi documents, enabling them to stay and work in the country or were registered as asylum seekers with the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

Iraq hosts approximately 280,000 Syrians, with the vast majority of them in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI). While parts of Syria have not had active conflict hostilities since 2018, Syria remains unfit for safe and dignified refugee returns. Deporting asylum seekers breaches Iraq’s obligations as a party to the UN Convention Against Torture (CAT) and under the customary international law principle of nonrefoulment, that is, not to forcibly return people to countries where they face a clear risk of torture or other persecution.

“Iraq should immediately end its distressing campaign of arbitrary arrests and deportations of Syrians who have fled to Iraq for safety,” said Sarah Sanbar, Iraq researcher at Human Rights Watch. “By forcibly returning asylum seekers to Syria, Iraq is knowingly placing them in harm’s way.”

In August 2023, the Supreme Judicial Council of Iraq banned the deportation of any Syrian refugee from Iraq. Nevertheless, on March 18, 2024, Iraqi authorities launched a campaign targeting foreigners who violate residency rules, resulting in the detention and deportation of many Syrians after raids on their homes and workplaces. And on April 3, 2024, the Kurdistan Regional Government suspended KRI visa issuance for Syrians, reportedly at the request of the federal government in Baghdad amid broader efforts to regulate foreign labor.

Between April 19 and 26, Human Rights Watch spoke with seven Syrians by phone and in person in Erbil and Baghdad, four of whom were at Erbil International Airport awaiting deportation. Four had valid Iraqi residence permits and three were registered with the UNHCR. Some are not identified by name for their protection.

The Iraqi Ministry of Interior did not respond to Human Rights Watch’s multiple requests for comment.

People interviewed reported being arrested in raids on their workplace or on the streets, and two said they were arrested at residency offices while trying to renew their permits. Authorities reportedly did not consider their asylum seeker status nor provide consistent opportunities to appeal their deportation orders.

A 43-year-old Syrian man from Aleppo was detained at a checkpoint in Diwaniyah city south of Baghdad. After 12 days in detention, he was brought before a judge and presented his UNHCR asylum seeker certificate to no avail. He received a fine and a deportation order to Syria. Although he has filed an appeal, his lawyer said that his chances of success are slim.

“My life is in danger in Syria,” the man told Human Rights Watch. “I can’t go back to Aleppo, and I don’t want to go to northeast Syria.” His 16-year-old son has been detained in Karrada, Baghdad, since April 14 for violating residency laws, while his other son has been detained since March 19, also for violating residency laws, without being brought before a judge.

He was the only one interviewed who had been given the opportunity to appeal his deportation order. None of the other Syrians interviewed had appeared before a judge during or after their detention, and all were summarily deported.

The 18-year-old son of Nawal, a Syrian woman in her 40s from Aleppo, was detained by the Asayish, or Kurdish security forces, while selling water near a traffic light in Erbil. When Nawal went to the detention center where he was being held, she too was arrested despite holding a valid residency permit. She said Kurdish authorities told them that they must purchase tickets to Syria and leave Iraq or face continued detention.

The Asayish escorted Nawal and her son in handcuffs through border control at the Erbil airport, where they spent four days stuck in the departures terminal trying to collect enough money to book a flight to Damascus. “Syria is not safe, but there is nowhere else we can go. No other country will let us in,” Nawal said. Immediately after arriving in Damascus, Nawal and her son paid a smuggler to take them to Lebanon.

The deportation campaign has left Syrians living in fear. During Ramadan, a 23-year-old man woke up at 5 a.m. as usual and left his house in Baghdad to go to work. “I saw a police car in the street in front of my workplace. I ran home and stayed there for two days because I was so afraid of arrest,” he said.

He said he worries that having an asylum seeker certificate from UNHCR will not be enough to protect him from being deported back to Daraa in southern Syria.

“Since the Iraqi government announced the expulsion of all illegal workers, every day, or at least three times a week, the police come to my workplace and search for me,” said a 25-year-old man from Sweida in southern Syria. “The employer and other staff warn me, and I run to hide, while another staff member covers my position. They always ask the employees if there are Syrians working in the place.”

“The situation is unstable in Sweida,” he said. “There are many different militias. When they know an expatriate has returned to the city, they will kidnap him until he pays ransom.” On May 12, Baladi News reported that the Iraqi government had released 47 detained Syrians from Sweida without deporting them.

In July 2023, the federal government in Baghdad arrested and deported three Syrian Kurds for breaching residency rules. At that time, the New Arab reported that another 30 Syrians were detained in Baghdad for similar residency violations and faced the possibility of being deported.

Syrian refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Cyprus, and Turkey have been increasingly facing the threat of summary deportation.

Human Rights Watch has documented numerous instances in which Syrian security agencies have arbitrarily detained, kidnapped, tortured, and killed refugees who returned to Syria between 2017 and 2021. As recently as July 2023, Human Rights Watch found that returnees had been tortured in Syrian military intelligence custody and conscripted to serve in Syria’s military reserve force. Other human rights groups, the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria (COI), and the UNHCR also maintain that Syria remains unsafe for returns. In March 2024, the COI said that Syria is experiencing a “new wave of violence” not seen since 2020.

The Iraqi government should immediately halt its campaign of arbitrary arrests, detention, and deportations of Syrian asylum seekers. Iraqi authorities should establish a workable system for determining refugee status in line with international standards. Iraq should also consider implementing procedures to facilitate getting work and residence permits for those with irregular status. This should include maintaining collaboration with the UNHCR to ensure proper protection of refugee rights.

International donor governments should use their leverage to advocate against summary deportations and forced returns which amount to a breach of nonrefoulement obligations, Human Rights Watch said.

Iraq is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention nor its supplementary 1967 Protocol. The Political Refugee Law No. 51 of 1971 acknowledges political and “military” refugees, but the government stopped granting refugee status to Syrians who arrived after 2011. UNHCR registers Syrians in federal Iraq and issues them asylum-seeker certificates, which they can use to register with the Permanent Committee for Refugees under the Ministry of Interior, where they are categorized as “displaced from border areas of Syria and received for humanitarian reasons” and issued personal identification cards which exempt them from the Foreign Residency Law. The Kurdistan Regional Government, on the other hand, acknowledges Syrians as asylum seekers, which entitles them to obtain humanitarian residence permits following registration with UNHCR.

“The Iraqi government is obligated to ensure that Syrian asylum seekers’ rights are protected in accordance with both international refugee law and the ruling of the Supreme Judicial Council,” Sanbar said. “Unfortunately, the Iraqi authorities are doing the opposite by sending Syrian asylum seekers back to precarious conditions in Syria.”",HIGH,20240627T070000Z,Human Rights Watch,Sarah Sanbar,Iraqi authorities,"Erbil, Baghdad, and various detention centers in Iraq","End arbitrary arrests, establish refugee status determination system, collaborate with UNHCR to protect refugee rights.",Arbitrary detention and deportation of Syrian asylum seekers,Iraq,"Iraqi government's campaign against illegal residency, lack of international obligations towards refugees"

Without more international attention, the next country to do so may be Peru — thanks to Peru’s own government.

A mosaic of private interests has been increasingly bending Peru’s government to their will, breaking the systems that could hold them and their allies accountable, and dismantling protections for human rights and the environment. In the process, they are creating an ideal environment for organized crime to thrive, deepen corruption and further undermine democracy.

Washington has seemed reluctant to say or do much about the assault on the rule of law, perhaps concerned about feeding into political instability or growing Chinese influence. But if Peru continues down its path of institutional destruction, U.S. officials may soon be dealing with even more dangerous and unstable counterparts.

Much of the problem stems from Peru’s Congress. Since they appropriately removed then-President Pedro Castillo after his failed coup in December 2022, politicians from across the political spectrum have joined forces, not to unify the country but to push forward an agenda that’s the stuff of corrupt and criminal actors’ dreams.

Last year, Congress effectively gutted the country’s Efficient Collaboration Law, which had been an essential tool in investigations of organized crime, including the cases against former president Alberto Fujimori’s criminal network. The change may well benefit many representatives themselves, more than half of whom were recently reported to be under criminal investigation.

Congress also shortened the period for tolling the statute of limitations in criminal cases; the president of Congress, Alejandro Soto, immediately invoked the new law to seek dismissal of a criminal case pending against him.

Congress is now considering a bill significantly narrowing the criminal law definition of “organized crime,” making it harder to investigate many related offenses, such as extortion, which has shot up dramatically in recent years.

Other congressional actions directly benefit organized crime and private interests that profit from illegal activities. Illegal gold mining, which according to former Interior Minister and security expert Carlos Basombrío, is now the major illicit economy in the country, was worth an estimated U.S. $4 billion in 2023. Illegal gold mining has been increasingly associated with human trafficking and killings, particularly in remote areas where there is little state presence.

Congress’s repeated extension of a deadline by which informal miners are supposed to register with the government has enabled harmful extraction practices to continue, poisoning rivers and land with impunity. Meanwhile, recent amendments to the country’s Forestry Law, which regularized past large-scale illegal deforestation, will most likely shutter many environmental crime investigations.

Far from fighting these measures, President Dina Boluarte — also now under criminal investigation in connection with her receipt of three Rolex watches and a $50,000 bracelet from the governor of the impoverished Peruvian state of Ayacucho — has repeatedly joined forces with Congress, which recently voted down several motions to remove her from office.

Meanwhile, Congress has been steadily capturing institutions that would impose checks upon them, including through questionable appointment processes for the Constitutional Tribunal and the Ombudsperson’s office. Both bodies now routinely side with congressional interests in ways that undermine the rule of law and human rights; legal experts, including the Lima Bar Association, have criticized some of the tribunal’s rulings as flagrantly unconstitutional.

In March, Congress removed on specious grounds two members of the National Justice Board, which appoints judges, prosecutors and the heads of key electoral agencies. On June 5, a congressional committee approved a constitutional amendment that would eliminate the board entirely and give legislators the power to name electoral authorities instead.

Many Peruvians have watched their authorities with disgust; approval ratings for Congress and President Boluarte are in the single digits. But the public has largely remained silent since the authorities brutally cracked down on protests in 2023, leaving 49 protesters and passersby dead. Peruvians — many seeing no future in the country — are leaving in record numbers.

Peru has strong commercial ties to China, but the United States still has tremendous influence and should be more vocal about the slow-brewing crisis. Many Peruvians credit a statement by U.S. Sens. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.) with deterring Peru’s Congress from removing the entire National Justice Board in March.

Peruvian officials still like to travel to the U.S. Removing visas of individuals credibly linked to abuse and corruption would send a strong message that the Biden administration cares about the rule of law in Peru.

The U.S. should also work with democratic governments in the Organization of American States to raise concern about the weakening of Peru’s democracy. The OAS Inter-American Democratic Charter allows any member state — or the group’s secretary general — to convene the region’s ambassadors when a member nation suffers an “unconstitutional alteration of the constitutional regime that seriously impairs the democratic order.”

Last week, an Iranian court imposed a new bogus sentence on imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize winner and human rights defender Narges Mohammadi. Branch 29 of the Tehran Revolutionary Court sentenced Mohammadi to another year in Iran’s Evin prison on charges of “propaganda against the state.”

In January 2022, the same court, Branch 26 of the Tehran Revolutionary Court, sentenced her to two years prison and 74 lashes.

In imposing the additional sentence, the court cited Mohammadi’s call to boycott Iran’s recent parliamentary elections, her letters to lawmakers in Sweden and Norway supporting Iranian political prisoners, and her advocacy to governments in support of the “Woman, Life, Freedom” protests. It also pointed to her criticism of Iranian authorities’ torture and sexual assault of Dina Ghalibaf, an Iranian journalist and student of political science.

In December 2023, Mohammadi’s two children delivered her Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, in which she noted: “I write this message from behind the high, cold walls of a prison. The Iranian people, with perseverance, will overcome repression and authoritarianism.”

Human Rights Watch and others have long documented Iranian authorities’ record of brutally repressing dissent, including security forces’ extensive crackdown on the “Woman, Life, Freedom” protests following the death of Mahsa Jina Amini in morality police custody in September 2022. Iranian authorities have frequently targeted prominent rights defenders like Mohammadi, who has boldly campaigned for the abolition of the death penalty and has been outspoken in opposing Iranian authorities’ repressive policies.

Mohammadi is serving consecutive prison sentences, including prolonged solitary confinement of 135 days, which United Nations experts have recognized as a form of torture. Human Rights Watch has documented a pattern of serious violations in Evin prison and other detention facilities and prisons across Iran.

Mohammadi repeatedly called for her latest trial to be public in the presence of the media and independent observers and activists. Yet, according her lawyer, instead of holding a public trial, the authorities conducted the trial in her absence. The #FreeNargesCoalition—composed of PEN America, Reporters without Borders, and Front Line Defenders—and Human Rights Watch have called for Mohammadi’s immediate and unconditional release.

“Western governments should not postpone democracy and human rights by adopting strategies focused on the continuation of the Islamic Republic’s rule,” Mohammadi said in her Nobel speech. “Resistance is alive, and the struggle endures.”",HIGH,20240627T020000Z,Narges Mohammadi,"Narges Mohammadi, Mahsa Jina Amini, Dina Ghalibaf",Iranian authorities,"Evin prison, Tehran","Immediate and unconditional release of Narges Mohammadi, end to repression of dissent",Propaganda against the state,Iran,"Repressive policies of the Islamic Republic, suppression of dissent"

(Bangkok) – Unidentified gunmen shot and killed a prominent human rights defender in Pattani province in southern Thailand on June 25, 2024, Human Rights Watch said today. Thai authorities should urgently conduct a transparent and impartial investigation into the killing of Roning Dolah, 45, and bring those responsible to justice.

On June 25 at about 8:45 p.m., two assailants on a motorcycle opened fire at Roning with assault rifles in front of his family in Pattani’s Yarang district, instantly killing him, his wife said. Local police said seven 7.62mm and one 5.56mm bullet casings were found at the scene.

“The brutal killing of a prominent human rights defender underscores that anyone who speaks out for justice in Thailand’s deep south is at risk,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Thai authorities should urgently and transparently investigate this killing and bring all those responsible for Roning Dolah’s death to justice.”

On June 26, the Thai government’s Internal Security Operations Command Region 4 – responsible for counterinsurgency operations in the deep south – issued a statement expressing condolences to Roning’s family and asked for witnesses with information to come forward, but did not announce a full criminal investigation into his killing.

Roning was widely known in Thailand’s southern border provinces for assisting ethnic Malay Muslim victims of arbitrary arrest and torture by Thai security forces in counterinsurgency operations in Songkhla, Pattani, Yala, and Narathiwat provinces. He had previously been arrested and tortured in military custody, according to the Cross Cultural Foundation. Thai human rights groups used his accounts and information he gathered from other torture victims in their campaigns to demand accountability for military abuses and advocate for Thailand’s Act on Prevention and Suppression of Torture and Enforced Disappearances, which took effect in February 2023.

But during 20 years of armed insurgency in Thailand’s southern border provinces, not a single soldier or other security personnel member has been prosecuted for unlawfully detaining, torturing, or extrajudicially killing suspected insurgents.

Thailand has an obligation under international human rights law to ensure that all human rights defenders and organizations can carry out their work in a safe and enabling environment, Human Rights Watch said.

The killing of Roning is a crucial test of Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin’s pledge to promote and protect human rights in his speeches to the Thai parliament on September 11, 2023 , and to the United Nations General Assembly on September 22. Despite Thailand’s adoption of a much-advertised national human rights agenda and its efforts to be elected to a seat on the UN Human Rights Council for the 2025-2027 term, Thai authorities have done little to address threats and violence, as well as the use of strategic lawsuits by government agencies and non-state actors to silence those reporting human rights violations.

“The Srettha government should promptly act to reverse the deepening climate of fear in Thailand’s deep south by showing that those responsible for killing Roning will be held to account,” Pearson said. “Thai authorities should take concrete measures to protect the rights of ethnic Malay Muslims to speak out about state-sponsored abuses and demand justice.”",HIGH,20240627T033000Z,Human Rights Watch,Roning Dolah,Thai authorities and unidentified gunmen,"Pattani province, Thailand","Urgent and transparent investigation, protection for ethnic Malay Muslims",Killing of human rights defender Roning Dolah,Thailand,"Armed insurgency, lack of accountability for military abuses"

Peru’s Ministry of Health has clarified that trans identities are not mental health conditions, walking back a heavily criticized presidential decree in May that portrayed trans identities as diagnosable in in the Essential Health Insurance Plan (Plan Esencial de Aseguramiento en Salud, PEAS).

The health ministry justified the decree as necessary to facilitate healthcare access for “transsexual people and people with gender identity disorders,” using outdated and pejorative language.

The decree drew fire from Peruvian human rights organizations and activists, including PROMSEX, Más Igualdad Perú (More Equality Peru), and Gahela Cari. On May 17, activists staged a protest in front of the Ministry of Health calling for the revocation of the decree. US Congressman Robert García also criticized the decree and called for the United States Department of State to do more to support Peruvian LGBT people.

Historically, medical systems around the world have categorized being transgender as a mental health condition. Health providers use two sets of guidelines to diagnose patients: the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM).

The current version of the ICD, known as “ICD-11,” has reclassified “gender identity disorders” as “gender incongruence” and moved it from being listed with “mental disorders” to a chapter on sexual health. That was an important advance for transgender people, who should be able to seek health care without the stigma of being labeled as having a pathology.

The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, a group of UN human rights experts, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights, and the Council of Europe’s Commissioner for Human Rights have urged governments to reform because pathologization is “one of the root causes behind the human rights violations that [LGBT people] face.”

Peru is lagging on LGBT rights. It currently does not have a procedure for trans people to change their documents to reflect their gender identity, does not allow same-sex couples to marry or enter into civil unions, and does not have civil laws prohibiting discrimination against LGBT people.

The original problematic presidential decree is still in place and should be repealed, but the health ministry’s assertion that it will not be applied is an important step toward ensuring trans people’s dignity is respected.",HIGH,20240628T021500Z,Peruvian human rights organizations and activists,"Robert García, PROMSEX, Más Igualdad Perú, Gahela Cari",Peru's Ministry of Health,"Lima, Peru","Repeal the presidential decree, implement legal protections for LGBT rights",Classifying transgender identities as mental health conditions in a presidential decree,Peru,"Pathologization of transgender identities, lack of legal protections"

European Union leaders and investors are gathering in Cairo on June 29 and 30 for the “Egypt-EU Investment Conference,” which will bring billions to Egypt’s abusive leadership.

The conference comes a few months after the controversial upgrading of EU-Egypt bilateral relations to a “strategic and comprehensive partnership” and the related EU pledge of €7.4 billion in concessional loans, investments, and grants to the country.

In a June 13 joint letter, Human Rights Watch and Egyptian, regional, and international human rights groups urged the EU to ensure that its 5 billion macro-financial assistance to Egypt secures concrete, measurable, structural, and timebound human rights progress and reforms in the country. The groups stressed how, by wiping out civic, judicial, or parliamentary scrutiny, Egypt’s oppressive government has virtually unaccountable rule and controls the economy in ways that benefit itself but are disastrous for the broader public. The absence of checks and balances contributes to the government’s failure to respect, protect, and fulfil people’s social and economic rights and to recurring economic crises in the country.

The letter notes that both the EU commission and council stressed that “concrete and credible steps” towards democratization and respect for the rule of law and human rights constitute a “pre-condition for granting the Union's macro-financial assistance to Egypt.” Despite that, Egyptian authorities do not seem inclined to backtrack on their repressive rule, exemplified by the recent abusive sentencing of opposition politician Ahmed Tantawy. The first of the 5 billion is expected to reach Egypt by year end, whereas conditions for the remaining 4 billion are still to be negotiated and will need European parliamentary approval.

Egyptians are in dire need for support. Repeated economic crises have led to prolonged, nationwide power cuts, rising poverty, and skyrocketing food prices. But Europe’s financial support should be used to secure key human rights reforms, not risk fueling corruption and abuses in Egypt, nor miss a chance to address some of the root causes of the violations of the economic rights of so many Egyptians.

Europe’s inaction would come at the expense of the civil, political, economic, and social rights of ordinary Egyptians, who are ruled with an iron fist and have no safe chance to question their governments’ policies. It’s these Egyptians who will ultimately carry the burden of economic mismanagement and unsustainable debt accumulation.",HIGH,20240628T070000Z,"Human Rights Watch and Egyptian, regional, and international human rights groups",Ahmed Tantawy,Egyptian government,"Cairo, Egypt",Use financial support to secure human rights reforms and address root causes of economic rights violations.,"Failure to respect, protect, and fulfill social and economic rights; oppressive government actions",Egypt,"Lack of civic, judicial, or parliamentary scrutiny; unaccountable governance"

Last week, Sierra Leone’s parliament enacted landmark legislation to ban child marriage. The Prohibition of Child Marriage Bill 2024, which makes marriage for anyone under 18 a criminal offense, seeks to protect girls from a harmful practice that has long violated their rights and hindered their development.

Child marriage is a serious problem in Sierra Leone, where 30 percent of girls and 4 percent of boys are married before age 18, with even higher rates in rural areas. Around 800,000 girls are currently married in Sierra Leone, half before turning 15.

Child marriages fuel the high adolescent pregnancy rate in Sierra Leone where, tragically, pregnancy complications are the leading cause of death for girls aged 15-19.

The new law prohibits all forms of child marriage and cohabitation with a child, including aiding and abetting, protects the best interests of children, and ensures affected girls have access to counseling and safeguarding. The law amends existing legislation, including the Child Rights and Registration of Customary Marriage Acts, to harmonize the legal framework on marriage and break the cycle of early marriage and its devastating consequences.

The law also builds on Sierra Leone’s efforts to protect young girls from marriage and tackle barriers to girls’ education. A new education law, adopted in 2023, guarantees children 13 years of free education, including one year of preprimary education as well as secondary education.

The First Lady’s “Hands Off Our Girls” campaign has been instrumental in advocating against child marriage.

The legislation is a milestone in Sierra Leone's journey towards gender equality and child protection. It also sets a pathway forward for other African nations, such as Tanzania and Zambia, to revoke laws that permit child marriage, and ensure girls can complete primary and secondary education.

Now, Sierra Leone’s government should raise awareness, particularly in rural areas, about the new law and the harmful effects of child marriage. The government should also address other prevalent harmful practices linked to child marriage, such as female genital mutilation. It should collaborate with local communities, nongovernmental groups, and international organizations to publicly campaign about the harms associated with child marriage, while also providing support services for married children and children at risk of child marriage.

The government will also need to continue focusing on keeping girls in school, while it develops sustainable economic opportunities and social programs that empower girls and their families.",HIGH,20240628T154500Z,Sierra Leone’s parliament and advocates for girls' rights,"First Lady, advocates, lawmakers",Cultural practices allowing child marriage,"Koidu, Kono district, Sierra Leone","Raise awareness, address harmful practices, support services for at-risk children",Child marriage violates the rights of girls and hinders their development,Sierra Leone,Cultural norms and economic vulnerability

(Nairobi) – Those responsible for a brutal attack 10 years ago on a Central African Republic church serving as a camp for displaced people still need to face justice, Human Rights Watch said today.

The May 28, 2014 attack at the Notre-Dame church in the Fatima neighborhood of the country’s capital, Bangui, took place less than a kilometer from African Union (AU) peacekeeping forces and is emblematic of the impunity that has enabled violence between rival armed groups to continue in the country for over a decade.

After the attack, Human Rights Watch confirmed that 17 people had been killed in the camp, allegedly by fighters aligned with the Seleka, a predominantly Muslim coalition of armed groups. However, the tally was most likely higher as some victims were buried immediately. The nearby AU peacekeeping mission did not provide security to the camp before the attack.

“The 2014 Fatima massacre was an egregious attack on civilians in the capital that highlights the problems international peacekeepers face in the Central African Republic,” said Lewis Mudge, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “Even years later, delivering justice now will send a powerful signal that while justice may take time, it will catch up with those responsible for the crimes.”

The attack falls within a broader pattern of violence in the country that the Seleka started a decade ago. Christian anti-balaka militias rose across the country in response to the Seleka and quickly began to target Muslim civilians, associating them with the Seleka coalition.

The Fatima massacre is being investigated by the Special Criminal Court (SCC) in Bangui. In 2022, four armed group leaders aligned with the Seleka – Gary Hadiatou, Ali Abdel Kader, Oumar Al Bachir, and Yalo Amadou – were arrested in connection to the case. They have been charged with multiple counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes.

In January 2023, the court’s deputy special prosecutor told the media that a trial could open in the first quarter of that year. The trial never did, and in June 2023, the court informed the media that one of the accused, Al Bachir, had died in hospital. This, coupled with the court’s requirement that pretrial detention cannot exceed three years, underscores the urgency for the trial to start.

The special court was established to investigate and prosecute serious international crimes committed in Central African Republic since 2003. It is staffed by national and international judges and personnel. Since it began operations in 2018, it has completed the prosecution of one case involving crimes in the northwestern part of the country in 2019. A second trial, started in December 2023, is ongoing.

The court recently issued an arrest warrant against former president François Bozizé for crimes against humanity allegedly committed between February 2009 and March 23, 2013, by the Presidential Guard and other security services under his responsibility at the Bossembelé military training center, referred to as “Guantanamo,” north of Bangui.

A family member of a victim of the killings in Fatima recently told Human Rights Watch: “Ten years later, we are still awaiting justice, we hope it comes soon.”

The Notre-Dame church in Fatima served as a camp for thousands of residents of Bangui displaced after the anti-balaka attacked the capital on December 5, 2013, prompting waves of violence and revenge killings. At least 7,000 people were at the camp on the day of the attack.

The attack came after months of tit-for-tat killings between anti-balaka and armed Muslims, some of whom were aligned with Seleka groups, from the Kilomètre 5 neighborhood, which borders Fatima.

On May 28, 2014, Seleka attackers from Kilomètre 5 arrived at the church. One witness told Human Rights Watch, “I saw more than 30 men on the road with guns, running to us. Since it was daylight, I could see them attacking. They did not hide their faces.”

Witnesses and survivors described a scene of total chaos as thousands tried to escape or hide. Some survivors piled into outdoor concrete pews behind the church.

The attackers entered the church from different directions. Multiple survivors and witnesses said that the attackers were armed with Kalashnikovs, grenades, and machetes. Many people recognized some of the attackers as Seleka fighters from Kilomètre 5.

A relative of Héritier Moket, a 15-year-old who was killed, said, “I was still in front of the church with Héritier; my wife and kids had already run behind the church. I saw the attackers coming and I told him to run. We were running around trying to escape but he was shot.”

Another survivor, who was badly injured on his face and arm by machetes, said he had been surrounded by about nine men. He said: “I put my hands up but they were already attacking. They asked in Arabic if I was an anti-balaka. I can speak some Arabic [so I told them I was not]. They said nothing, they just started striking me with machetes. I fell to the ground and was hit in the head until I lost consciousness, and they thought I was already dead.”

Another survivor, who was shot in the stomach, said, “I jumped into a toilet to hide and just a few seconds later they shot at it. A bullet went through my arm and entered my abdomen on the left side.”

Impunity for those responsible for serious crimes in Central African Republic has fueled recurring cycles of violence and emboldened armed groups to continue to commit atrocities, leaving trails of death, displacement, and destitution, Human Rights Watch said.

The attack at Fatima was among the first in a long line of egregious attacks on camps for the internally displaced in the country. The Notre-Dame church continued to serve as a displacement camp and was attacked again in 2018, when at least 16 people were killed and many others wounded.

“Central Africans have waited for a decade to see justice for brutal killings in Fatima and the Special Criminal Court holds the promise of delivering it,” Mudge said. “The government and the court’s international partners should step up their efforts to support the court to ensure that it can effectively execute its crucial mandate.”",VERY HIGH,20240530T084500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Lewis Mudge, Gary Hadiatou, Ali Abdel Kader, Oumar Al Bachir, Yalo Amadou, François Bozizé",Seleka coalition,"Notre-Dame church, Fatima neighborhood, Bangui","Support to the Special Criminal Court, urgent commencement of trials for accountability",Brutal attack on civilians at Notre-Dame church,Central African Republic,"Long-standing violence between armed groups (Seleka and anti-balaka), lack of accountability"

Dear Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa,

On May 20, the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor, Karim Khan, applied to the court’s judges for arrest warrants against three Hamas leaders (Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Diab Ibrahim Al-Masri – more commonly known as Deif – and Ismail Haniyeh) and two senior Israeli officials (Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant) for alleged crimes committed since October 7, 2023, in relation to his ongoing Palestine investigation.

We, the undersigned Japanese NGOs, urge Japan, as an ICC member committed to a rules-based international order, to protect the court’s independence and publicly condemn efforts to intimidate or interfere with the court’s work, its officials, and those cooperating with the institution.

On April 24, 12 US senators wrote to Khan, threatening to end all US support to the ICC, sanction the institution and its officials, and bar the prosecutor and court staff from entering the United States if steps were taken to pursue warrants against Israeli officials. US congress members have also introduced legislation aimed at imposing sanctions on ICC officials. The speaker of the House of Representatives has called on the Biden administration to “immediately and unequivocally demand that the ICC stand down and the US should use every available tool to prevent such an abomination.”

Meanwhile, there have been reports that the Israeli government was seeking support from ICC member countries and other governments in opposing the Office of the Prosecutor’s ongoing Palestine investigation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also publicly denounced the ICC and called on governments to thwart the court’s efforts to scrutinize Israeli actions. In response to these attacks, the Prosecutor’s Office issued a statement on May 3 noting the court’s jurisdiction over offenses against the administration of justice and “insist[ing] that all attempts to impede, intimidate, or improperly influence its officials cease immediately.”

The presidency of the ICC's governing body, the Assembly of States Parties (ASP), has called for respect for the court’s independence in the wake of these latest threats. This is not the first time the ICC has faced politicized opposition. As you know, the former US administration abused its sanctions regime against the prosecutor’s predecessor in a bid to undermine or deter investigations that could implicate US or Israeli nationals. At the time, 67 member countries, the ASP President, and nongovernmental organizations spoke out for the court. When the current US administration lifted the sanctions in 2021, Japan welcomed the move. Similarly, following its issuance of an arrest warrant for Russian president Vladmir Putin as part of the prosecutor’s ongoing Ukraine investigation, in 2023, Russia issued arrest warrants against the Khan and six of the court’s judges, including current ICC President Tomoko Akane. Russian lawmakers have also enacted a law criminalizing cooperation with the ICC. Member countries, including Japan, and the ASP presidency publicly condemned these attacks against the court.

The ICC plays an essential role as a court of last resort to deliver justice to victims of the world’s worst crimes. ICC members like Japan have a responsibility to protect the court’s impartiality and independence across all situations on its docket.

We took note of the statement delivered by Japan and Switzerland on May 14, on behalf of ICC members on the UN Security Council, reiterating their commitment to uphold and defend the values of the Rome Statute, “undeterred by threats and measures against the Court, its officials, and those cooperating with it.”

We urge Japan to make clear that the court’s judges have full support in undertaking their independent examination of the prosecutor’s applications for arrest warrants in the Palestine situation. We also look for your public support for arrest warrants the court may issue, commit to working to ensure the execution of such warrants, and press Palestinian and Israeli authorities to cooperate with the court.

Regrettably, many ICC members were initially silent on the importance of pursuing accountability and justice before the court for both Israeli and Palestinian victims, who have faced a wall of impunity for decades. This has led to perceptions of double standards, putting the ICC’s legitimacy at risk. It is crucial that the ICC can investigate and prosecute grave international crimes across all situations under its jurisdiction.

Whether the ICC can meaningfully and effectively deliver on its mandate will largely depend on the will of the international community and ICC member countries like Japan to support impartial and independent justice no matter where the abuses are committed and by whom. We urge you to make clear that your government stands with those who seek justice for grave human rights crimes, not those who threaten and harass the prosecutors and judges who aim to bring those committed serious human rights abuses to justice.

Sincerely,

(Beirut) – Tunisian authorities have ramped up their crackdown on media and freedom of expression in recent weeks, sentencing two journalists and a media founder to prison sentences, detaining another media figure, and intimidating private media, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said today. The authorities should immediately release those detained and drop all prosecutions for expression protected under international human rights law.

In the lead-up to Tunisia’s first presidential election since President Kais Saied’s July 2021 power grab, expected to be held in the fall, the Tunisian authorities have escalated their repression of free speech under Decree-Law 2022-54 on Cybercrime as well as other archaic laws. Simultaneously, they have clamped down on civil society groups, especially those defending migrants and refugees’ rights against the backdrop of the EU migration deal, leading to an unprecedented shrinking of civic space since the 2011 revolution.

“By attacking journalists and other media figures, Saied’s government is moving to put the last nail in the coffin of Tunisia’s civic space,” said Lama Fakih, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “After undermining the judiciary, jailing several dozen opponents and critics and attacking civil society organizations, Saied is now targeting the media.”

“Tunisian authorities are methodically annihilating the last remaining gains of the 2011 revolution: freedom of expression and the press,” said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa director. “Ahead of the elections, the government should ensure that all Tunisians are able to freely express their views without fear of retaliation, and that independent media are able to conduct their reporting free from harassment or intimidation and broadcast open discussions.”

Based on Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International’s count, over 70 people, including political opponents, lawyers, journalists, activists, human rights defenders, and social media users have been subjected to arbitrary prosecutions since the end of 2022. At least 40 remain arbitrarily detained as of May 2024, with most of them held in connection with the exercise of their internationally protected rights.

On May 22, the Tunis First Instance Court sentenced Borhen Bsaies and Mourad Zeghidi, both prominent journalists, to a year in prison under article 24 of Decree-Law 2022-54, in separate cases. The next day, the same court handed a media founder and tech activist a nine-month suspended prison sentence in relation to his online expression after detaining him for 11 days.

Tunisian security forces arrested Bsaies and Zeghidi separately on the evening of May 11. Based on the police report seen by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, Bsaies, who anchors two primetime talk shows on private TV and radio channels, was questioned about statements he made on the radio and on TV between 2020 and 2023, including comments on the dissolution of the High Judicial Council by President Saied in February 2022, among other topics. He was also questioned about social media posts that the police deemed to be critical of President Saied. Ghazi Mrabet, Zeghidi’s lawyer, said that police confronted him with nine video clips of statements made between February and April 2024, and they questioned Zeghidi’s Facebook post supporting an investigative journalist, Mohamed Boughalleb, who is serving a six-month sentence for publicly questioning a government ministry’s public spending.

On May 11, Sonia Dahmani, a lawyer and media commentator and Bsaies’ and Zeghidi’s colleague on the popular daily program “Emission Impossible” on the private radio station IFM, was also arrested under Decree-Law 2022-54. Dozens of masked plain clothes security forces stormed the headquarters of the Tunisian bar association and arrested her for sarcastic comments made on the private TV channel Carthage+ on May 7 questioning the claim that Black African migrants were seeking to settle in Tunisia. On May 13, an investigative judge in the Tunis Court of First Instance ordered her pretrial detention and on May 20 the same judge rejected a release request submitted by Dahmani’s lawyer. Dahmani is facing investigation in two prior separate Decree-Law 2022-54 cases for her public comments, based on complaints by the General Prison Directorate and justice minister.

Masked officers also attacked France 24 correspondents Maryline Dumas and Hamdi Tlili, who were broadcasting Dahmani’s arrest live, and broke their camera. Tlili was briefly arrested and beaten.

Decree-Law 2022-54 on Cybercrime, issued by President Saied in September 2022, violates the right to privacy and introduces harsh sentences for broadly and vaguely defined speech offenses. The authorities have frequently used article 24 of this decree to stifle dissent. Article 24 stipulates a five-year prison sentence and a fine of up to TND 50,000 (about US$16,000) for using telecommunications networks to produce, send, or disseminate “fake news” or “rumors;” to harm, defame, or incite violence against others; or to undermine public safety or national defense, spread fear, or incite hatred. The sentence is doubled if the offense targets a “public official or equivalent.”

Tunisian authorities should repeal Decree-Law 2022-54, along with vague or overbroad provisions of other existing codes that have been used to criminalize free expression, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said.

Indirectly referring to recent arrests, Saied said on May 15 in a meeting with his justice minister that “those who denigrate their country in the media ... cannot remain unaccountable and unpunished.” Between May 13 and 16, at least three representatives of private media outlets were summoned for questioning as part of various investigations, based on media reports. They include IFM’s director, who was asked about the radio station’s editorial line; Diwan FM’s editor-in-chief, who said he had been questioned about a comment made in 2020; and a Carthage+ executive.

In 2023, Zied el-Heni, a former “Emission Impossible” journalist, since fired, was arrested in June and again in December in two separate cases in connection with critical comments he made on the air. On January 10, 2024, he was sentenced to a six-month suspended prison term for “insulting” the trade minister under article 86 of the Telecommunications Code, his lawyer Ayachi Hammami told Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International.

Article 86 of the Telecommunications Code, which the authorities have long weaponized to stifle freedom of expression, carries a penalty of up to two years in prison.

Mohamed Boughalleb, another journalist, has been detained since March 22 for questioning the size of the religious affairs minister’s delegations during his official trips abroad on his Facebook page and on Carthage+ and Cap FM radio station in February and March, his lawyer, Anas Kaddoussi, told Human Rights Watch. On April 17, Boughalleb, who was sued by an official of the Religious Affairs Ministry, was sentenced to six months in prison for defaming an official under article 128 of the penal code. Since April 5, Boughalleb has been detained in a separate Decree-Law 2022-54 case also in connection with public statements, Kaddoussi said.

Similarly, journalist Chadha Hadj Mbarek has been detained since July 20, 2023, for her work for the digital content production company Instalingo. Hadj Mbarek, whose main role was to produce lifestyle content for a Facebook page, was accused of “undermining external security” under article 61-bis of Tunisia’s penal code, her lawyer, Malek Ben Amor, told Human Rights Watch.

(Berlin, May 30, 2024) – Increasing numbers of people in Uzbekistan are being prosecuted and imprisoned for “insulting the president online,” Human Rights Watch said today. The criminal charge carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and violates international human rights law.

“People in Uzbekistan should be able to criticize the president and other authorities openly, without fear of reprisal,” said Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The government should urgently repeal the offense of ‘insulting the president online’ and take immediate steps to release anyone imprisoned on this charge.”

Uzbek authorities should stop prosecuting citizens who have criticized President Shavkat Mirziyoyev and his family and repeal the law that makes it an offense.

Human Rights Watch reviewed one indictment and five verdicts handed down to people in Uzbekistan in the last year on the charge of “public insult or slander against the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, as well as using the press or other media, telecommunications networks, or the Internet,” under article 158, part 3 of the Uzbek Criminal Code, and found that authorities in Uzbekistan are wrongfully prosecuting citizens for nonviolent exercise of their right to freedom of expression.Other reports indicate even higher numbers of prosecutions on this charge.

Otkirbek Sobirov, 27, expressed his frustration on social media in January 2023 with interruptions to the supply of gas and electricity in the city of Kokand. On May 16, 2023, a Fergana court sentenced Sobirov to two years and three months in prison on charges of “insulting the president online,” “attempting to overthrow the Constitutional order of Uzbekistan,” and “mass riots” under articles 158, part 3; 159, part 1; and 244, part 2b of the criminal code.

The verdict says that Sobirov, who admitted he was frustrated about the gas and electricity cuts during the winter months, sent multiple messages in a Telegram group in which he criticized state policies and called on the president to resign. He also called for a rally against gas and electricity shortages in Kokand.

A state-ordered linguistic analysis concluded that Sobirov’s messages contained calls and ideas aimed at overthrowing legitimate representatives of the authorities, as well as signs of a call for riots that threaten public peace.

On October 26, 2023, the Kattakurgan district court convicted Dilshod Iskandarov, 19, of “insulting the president online” and sentenced him to two-and-a-half years in a penal colony. A state-ordered expert analysis concluded that a single comment Iskandarov made on Instagram, in which he cursed the president’s family under a video of the family, was “insulting and discrediting.”

The verdict notes that sometime after he wrote the comment he deleted it, and that he voluntarily returned to Uzbekistan from Russia after he learned a criminal case had been opened against him.

On March 28, 2024, the Namangan city court sentenced D. Tursunov, 27, to five years in prison for “insulting the president online.” According to the verdict, Tursunov, using the Facebook profile “Muhammad Sanjar,” commented about the Uzbek president attending Moscow’s Victory Day parade, saying: “The traitor went [to Russia] to get a white blessing for [his] lifetime rule.”

The prosecution alleged that Tursunov also insulted President Mirziyoyev, saying: “Even if a donkey circumambulates the Kaaba not twice, but a hundred times, he remains a donkey!” Tursunov was additionally found guilty of illegal border crossing because he did not possess an exit visa when he left Uzbekistan in September 2016. According to media reports, Tursunov returned to Uzbekistan in December 2023 and was arrested upon his return. Uzbekistan stopped requiring exit visas for citizens traveling abroad in 2019.

Sitora Bazarova, 24, was sentenced in early 2024 to five years and two months in prison by a Termez court on multiple criminal charges, including “insulting the president online.” According to the indictment, in May 2022, Bazarova posted on her Facebook page a video of two pictures that were set on fire, one of President Mirziyoyev, with the words “cuckold, let your family burn” written across it, and another of Saida Mirziyoyeva, the president’s daughter, who serves as his first assistant, with the word “slut” written across it.

A court in the Samarkand region sentenced Bunyodjon Boboniyazov, 39, to five years and one month on October 19, 2023, with a state-ordered linguistic analysis of comments he had made on Facebook as evidence that Boboniyazov attempted to overthrow the constitutional order and insulted the Uzbek president online.

Sobir Normamatov, 28, from the Samarkand region, was sentenced to two years and six months of corrective labor on April 8, 2024, for comments, including obscenities, he posted under three videos of President Mirziyoyev and one of Saida Mirziyoyeva on Instagram. In the comments, Normamatov referred to President Mirziyoyev as “a clown” and “duplicitous.”

Human Rights Watch has also seen the ruling of an appeals court in the case of a 40-year-old man in Kashkadarya who was sentenced to four years and six months in prison in February 2022 on charges of “insulting the president online” and “insult.” The ruling does not specify what speech served as the basis of the man’s conviction. Also in February 2022, the blogger Sobirjon Babaniyazov was sentenced to three years in prison under article 158 of the criminal code for videos and audio messages on Telegram that allegedly insulted the president.

Laws that penalize criticism of public figures are contrary to international law and the fact that some forms of expression are considered insulting is not sufficient to justify criminal prosecutions, far less imprisonment, Human Rights Watch said. The offense of “insult” against the president or other officials simply turns the criminal justice system into a tool of the government to take revenge against anyone who offends or slights it.

The United Nations Human Rights Committee, the independent expert body that monitors compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), states in its general comment on freedom of expression that “imprisonment is never an appropriate penalty” for defamation and that “all public figures … are legitimately subject to criticism.”

In 2020, President Mirziyoyev pledged to decriminalize defamation but has yet to do so. Instead, in March 2021, Uzbekistan introduced a new provision making insulting the president online—an even broader offense than defamation—a criminal offense.

The first known prosecution on this charge was of Valijon Kalonov, a blogger and government critic, who, in the lead up to the 2021 presidential elections, criticized the president and called for a boycott of the election. In December 2021, a Jizzakh court ruled that Kalonov could not be held criminally liable and sent him for compulsory psychiatric treatment.

For the last two-and-a-half years, Kalonov has been forcibly held in psychiatric detention, with authorities refusing to discharge him, a grave violation of his rights to liberty and security, health, bodily integrity, and freedom from inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The authorities should immediately release him, Human Rights Watch said.

“These ‘insulting the president’ cases make a mockery of President Mirziyoyev’s reform pledges, demonstrating instead a willingness to resort to tactics used by his strong-arm predecessor, Islam Karimov, to crack down on dissent and muzzle critical voices,” Williamson said. “The practice of locking people up on criminal insult charges has absolutely no place in a rights-respecting country.”",HIGH,20240530T050000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Shavkat Mirziyoyev, Otkirbek Sobirov, Dilshod Iskandarov, D.

In a historic decision last week, a longstanding United Nations body recognized that the international human rights system doesn’t fully protect older people’s rights, and it recommended a new human rights treaty to help correct this. Chaired by Argentina and following negotiations facilitated by Brazil and Portugal, the UN Open-ended Working Group on Ageing reached this decision by consensus.

Among its recommendations, the working group suggested countries pay more attention to older people in reporting on their implementation of existing international human rights treaties. The working group was set up in 2010 to identify and recommend ways to address protection gaps for older people in international human rights law.

One such gap is that no international human rights treaty explicitly prohibits violence, abuse, torture and ill-treatment, and neglect toward older people. Actions or treatment deemed unacceptable or even unlawful for younger people might be treated as acceptable for older people. In the absence of international standards providing clear guidance, states’ domestic laws often fail to adequately protect older people from mistreatment.

For example, in aged care facilities in Australia, Human Rights Watch has documented the widespread use of chemical restraints, which is the use of medications to control behavior without a therapeutic purpose. It is a form of violence and abuse against older people and may amount to torture or ill-treatment.

Although Australia told the working group that its new Aged Care Act will address the rights of older people, the draft legislation fails to ban the use of chemical restraint and instead specifically allows it.

The working group’s decision paves the way for the UN Human Rights Council to discuss the content of a new convention on the rights of older people. Given the severity of harms experienced by older people, governments should move swiftly to act on this recommendation.

A new convention would have a unique and significant impact on older people’s rights. It would increase understanding of how rights apply in older age, including freedom from violence, abuse, and neglect; set international standards and encourage the adoption of national laws that comply with them; and provide a framework, symbolically and substantively, for a world free from ageism and age discrimination.",HIGH,20240531T173000Z,Older People Advocacy Groups,"Elisha (Tanzania), Amarsanaa (Mongolia)",Australian Government,Aged care facilities in Australia,Establish a new international human rights treaty for older people,Failure to protect older people's rights and specific allowance of harmful practices in aged care,Australia,Lack of explicit international treaty protections for older people

(Bonn) – Governments attending UN climate talks in Bonn from June 3 to June 13, 2024, should push for rights-respecting and ambitious climate action, Human Rights Watch said today. The Bonn Climate Change conference will lay the groundwork for negotiations at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29) from November 11 to November 22, 2024.

At COP28, governments agreed to transition away from fossil fuels. At the Bonn climate talks, they should follow through on this commitment by implementing a full phaseout of all fossil fuels in a just and time-bound manner at the national level. They should also use the Bonn climate talks to press Azerbaijan, the host for the upcoming COP29, to allow civil society to demand and scrutinize climate action before, during, and after the conference.

“Bonn will be a key moment for all governments to turn words into action on a full, fair and time-bound fossil fuel phase-out and meaningful civil society participation in climate negotiations,” said Myrto Tilianaki, senior environmental advocate at Human Rights Watch.

COP28’s key outcome document, the Global Stocktake, called on countries to start “transitioning away from fossil fuels” but fell short of committing governments to phase out all fossil fuels within a clear time frame. As countries prepare to submit their national climate plans with emissions reductions targets in 2025, they should ensure that they are consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, existing fossil fuel projects are already more than the climate can withstand to limit global warming. The International Energy Agency has also stated that there cannot be any new fossil fuel projects if countries are to avert the worst consequences of the climate crisis.

While Azerbaijan has recently invested in renewable energy, its oil and gas industry provides most of the government’s revenue. During a high-level meeting in April 2024 to prepare for COP29, President Ilham Aliyev claimed that the country’s oil and gas reserves were “a gift from God,” while announcing plans to expand gas production mainly to respond to EU market demands. The EU is a major importer of Azerbaijani gas and it signed a deal in 2022 to double gas imports from Azerbaijan by 2027.

During the same meeting, Aliyev claimed that Azerbaijan will “defend the right” of other fossil fuel-rich nations to “continue investments and production because the world needs it.” Other countries should not allow Azerbaijan to use its position as host to continue to push the expansion of fossil fuels and undermine efforts to confront the climate crisis and protect human rights, Human Rights Watch said.

Azerbaijani authorities have a longstanding record of severely curtailing freedom of expression and association, swiftly and often brutally dispersing peaceful protests, and paralyzing the ability of independent nongovernmental organizations to work with its restrictive laws and arbitrary denials of registration. A crackdown on independent voices over the past year has resulted in the arrest or sentencing of at least 25 independent journalists and civil society activists on a variety of bogus criminal charges. Almost all remain in pretrial custody.

Among those detained is a prominent human rights defender, Anar Mammadli, arrested on bogus “smuggling” charges on April 29. Mammadli is a member of the Network of Human Rights Houses and a founding member of the recently formed Climate of Justice Initiative. The group is a civil society undertaking that seeks to use COP29 to promote civic space and environmental justice in Azerbaijan.

In July 2023, the authorities arrested Gubad Ibadoghlu, an anti-corruption activist and revenue transparency expert who focuses on Azerbaijan’s fossil fuel sector. He was detained on bogus counterfeiting and extremism charges and his health severely deteriorated in prison. Under intense international pressure in April 2024 the authorities transferred him to house arrest pending an investigation.

The German government, host of the Bonn climate talks, set a dangerous precedent recently with the indictment of Letzte Generation (Last Generation), a climate activist group known for acts of civil disobedience, as a criminal organization. This reflects a troubling European trend of stifling civil society and climate activism at a time when people are increasingly calling for stronger global efforts to tackle climate change.

Such actions risk chilling public participation in protests against state policies that fall short of addressing the climate crisis, including during the Bonn climate conference. COP28 was marred with unprecedented restrictions on freedom of speech from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Secretariat within the UN-run “blue zone.” To live up to their human rights commitments, the hosts of the UN Framework Convention’s conferences, including Germany and Azerbaijan, as well as its Secretariat, should respect the human rights of all participants, including their right to speak freely and to peacefully assemble inside and outside the official conference venue.

“Azerbaijan’s crackdown on freedom of expression and peaceful assembly raises grave concerns about whether independent members of civil society, activists, human rights defenders, and journalists at COP29 will be able to participate meaningfully before, during and after the conference,” Tilianaki said. “Robust civil society participation is important to hold governments to account and ensure ambitious COP29 outcomes.”

For this and future climate negotiations, the UN agency should make host agreements public and accessible, while ensuring that they uphold international human rights law. The UN should set human rights criteria for the selection of future COP hosts, including respect for the rights to freedom of speech and peaceful assembly. The UN should also ensure that fossil fuel industry interests do not undermine the credibility and outcome of the negotiations.

One of the main issues to be discussed at the Bonn climate meeting will be the establishment of the new global climate finance goal that governments are expected to set at COP29, to support the needs of developing countries in their mitigation and adaptation efforts. As countries negotiate new finance goals, they should commit to ending all forms of support, including subsidies and international finance, for oil, gas, and coal developments to rapidly reduce emissions and to limit the impacts of climate change. At the same time, they should put in place adequate measures to ensure that any associated price increases do not undermine people’s economic, social, and cultural rights.

“Holding COP29 in Azerbaijan raises serious concerns about the possibility of advancing ambitious climate action in negotiations,” Tilianaki said. “Governments attending the Bonn preparatory meeting should call out Azerbaijan for its repression of civil society and make clear that they will actively confront any attempts to weaken robust climate policies.”",HIGH,20240531T100000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Anar Mammadli, Gubad Ibadoghlu",Azerbaijani authorities,Azerbaijan,"UN should uphold human rights in climate negotiations, set human rights criteria for COP hosts.","Severely curtailing freedom of expression and association, and repressing civil society and journalists",Azerbaijan,"Government interest in maintaining fossil fuel revenue, repression of dissent"

May 30, 2024

Your Excellencies,

Ahead of and during the upcoming 56th Session of the Human Rights Council, we urge you and your delegation to raise concerns over the human rights situation in Bahrain, particularly regarding the continued arbitrary detention of human rights defenders and opposition leaders in Bahrain, many of whom have been wrongfully imprisoned since 2011.

Thirteen years since Bahrain’s popular uprising, systemic injustice has intensified and political repression targeting dissidents, human rights defenders, clerics and independent civil society has effectively shut any space for the peaceful exercise of the right to freedom of expression or peaceful activism in the country. Despite a series of legal reforms and the creation of new national human rights institutions, based on recommendations of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, an independent panel commissioned by the King in response to international concern over the suppression of the 2011 protests, most of these measures have had little impact in practice.

The recent royal pardon issued by King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa on 8 April 2024, on the occasion of Eid Al-Fitr and the King’s Silver Jubilee, was a significant move. The pardon included the release of more than 650 political prisoners, marking a change in state policy from previous royal pardons, according to research conducted by the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy. While the gesture is notable, Bahrain authorities must cease unjustly prosecuting their critics in the first place.

We also express concern that this pardon excluded many who played significant roles in the 2011 pro-democracy uprising, with an estimated 550 political prisoners remaining behind bars.

As Eid al-Adha approaches on 16 June 2024, and ahead of HRC56, we see a critical window of opportunity to advocate for further releases. We request that your governments continue to monitor the situation in Bahrain and raise concerns with Bahraini authorities at the highest level, publicly and privately. We further call on you to demand the immediate and unconditional release of all individuals imprisoned for their political beliefs and the retrial of those convicted and sentenced to death following unfair trials in full compliance with international fair trial standards.

Cases of Concern

We bring to your attention specific cases of individuals who remain unjustly imprisoned in Bahrain, in violation of their human rights and despite widespread international condemnation.

Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja, a Bahraini-Danish human rights defender, has been arbitrarily detained since 2011 for his role in peaceful demonstrations. Bahraini authorities have subjected Al-Khawaja to severe physical, sexual, and psychological torture, and his health has deteriorated significantly during his prolonged imprisonment.

Abduljalil Al-Singace, an award-winning human rights defender and blogger, remains arbitrarily detained since 2011 after being sentenced to life in prison on charges of “plotting to overthrow the government”. He is now approaching three years since he began a solid-food hunger strike after authorities confiscated his research manuscripts, sustaining himself only on multivitamin liquid supplements, tea with milk and sugar, water, and salts. Despite his disability and hunger strike, he continues to be denied adequate medical care.

Hassan Mushaima, an opposition leader aged 76, is serving a life sentence solely for exercising his right to freedom of association and expression. Over the past few months, his health has deteriorated. He continues to be denied access to adequate healthcare and remains arbitrarily detained. Since they were transferred to Kanoo Medical Center in 2021, Al-Singace and Mushaima have been held in prolonged solitary confinement and denied access to sunlight.

Sheikh Ali Salman, the leader of dissolved opposition party Al-Wefaq, was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in 2018 on politically motivated charges related to espionage. He has been imprisoned since 2014 on a separate conviction related to speeches he delivered in 2014 against parliamentary elections that his party boycotted. Amnesty International declared him a prisoner of conscience and called his conviction “a travesty of justice.”

Over a decade ago, the Human Rights Council issued a statement of concern “about guarantees of due process in the trials of 13 political activists who had their sentences, including life sentences, upheld in January 2013.” We note that of the “13 political activists” referenced, ten remain arbitrarily detained, including some of those listed above.

In 2023, the Committee to Protect Journalists documented the imprisonment of journalists, including Ali Mearaj and Hassan Qambar, who were excluded from the recent releases.

Additionally, twenty-six individuals in Bahrain remain on death row at risk of imminent execution, many of whom allege torture and unfair trials. Mohammed Ramadhan and Husain Moosa, who have now spent over a decade unlawfully detained, were sentenced to death in an unfair trial marred by torture allegations.

Conclusions and Recommendations

In light of the above, we respectfully urge your delegation to take a proactive stance in the lead-up to Eid al-Adha and during the upcoming session and:

Call on Bahrain to immediately and unconditionally release all individuals imprisoned solely for exercising their human rights.

Address these developments in your national capacity and jointly with other states, including during the Interactive Dialogues with the Special Rapporteurs and Independent Expert on health, freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association, independence of judges and lawyers and international solidarity.

Issue a statement raising concern about individual cases of human rights defenders and opposition leaders who continue to be arbitrarily detained in Bahrain in violation of international law.

With assurances of our highest consideration.

The stage finally seems set for the deployment of an international mission to Haiti.

We’ve looked at Haiti’s collapse into chaos in the Daily Brief before, and we’ve explained the need for an international mission to address it. We’ve also detailed how the Multinational Security Support mission (MSS), authorized by the UN Security Council in October, has faced delays in getting boots on the ground.

But the Kenyan-led MSS mission is expected in Haiti soon, after a Kenyan delegation arrived there last week. What’s more, Kenyan President William Ruto recently met in Washington with US President Joe Biden, who pledged more support to the mission.

This is encouraging news for people in Haiti.

The MSS mission is tasked with assisting Haitian police in rolling back the extreme turmoil in the country’s capital, Port-au-Prince. They will help police secure key infrastructure and fight the criminal groups that currently control nearly all of the city and that are responsible for widespread abuses.

At least three questions remain, however, especially when you recall the failures and abuses of past international responses in Haiti.

First, are the countries involved taking sufficient steps to ensure the MSS mission respects human rights?

Haitian police will oversee the operation, and the national security council will define and supervise the mission’s assistance. The US government says it’s vetting all MSS personnel as required by US law. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is collaborating on the design of the mission’s regulatory framework.

However, the UN Security Council has yet to receive critical – and required – information from the MSS mission on things like their rules of engagement, on human rights safeguards, and on accountability mechanisms.

What will happen, for example, if allegations emerge of abuses by Haitian National Police or MSS personnel? How can people report it, and how will it be investigated independently? Details like these need to be clear.

Second, what about the legal hurdles the MSS mission still faces? These include a January decision by Kenya’s High Court, finding the order to deploy police officers to Haiti unconstitutional. An appeal on that is pending, and a new lawsuit on the same grounds is scheduled for June.

Third, there’s a serious question about money. The mission’s trust fund has received only US$21 million. That’s far below the estimated initial operational costs of US$600 million.

Governments, especially the US, France, and those from Latin America and the Caribbean, should ensure the mission has what it needs.

Haitians urgently need international support to restore security, and it’s essential the job is done right – that means, with respect for human rights.",HIGH,20240601T230000Z,Haitian people,"Kenyan President William Ruto, US President Joe Biden, Haitian police",Multinational Security Support mission (MSS),"Port-au-Prince, Haiti",Ensure human rights oversight and accountability mechanisms are established before deployment.,Potential human rights abuses and failure to respect human rights during the mission,Haiti,"Chronic instability in Haiti, previous failures of international responses"

Dear Excellencies,

We write to you ahead of the third UN-convened meeting of Special Envoys and Special Representatives on Afghanistan on 30 June–1 July 2024 in Doha, Qatar (“Doha III”), to continue to discuss the international community’s approach to Afghanistan. More than one year since the first Doha meeting, there is growing concern that the international community lacks the necessary resolve to defend and advocate for the human rights of Afghan women and girls. Many Afghan women civil society have even called for a boycott of continued negotiations with the Taliban until women’s rights are restored.[1] Doha III therefore offers a decisive opportunity to demonstrate to all Afghans that their human rights are not a bargaining chip, but the foundation on which the future of their country depends.

Since the last Doha meeting in February 2024, the Taliban’s abuses against Afghan women and girls, already unparalleled globally and condemned by international experts as gender apartheid, have continued to deepen.[2] The Taliban are not only continuing to impose new restrictions violating the rights of women and girls, now numbering 97, but steadily intensifying their enforcement of existing decrees.[3] The space for women and girls to make their own decisions and live their lives gets smaller every day. This is a clear signal that the international community’s approach to Afghanistan has thus far failed to deter the Taliban from its systematic repression of women’s rights.

The upcoming meeting in Doha is a critical moment for the UN, Security Council and international community to coordinate around one key message: the rights of Afghan women and girls are not negotiable.

The success of the international community’s approach to Afghanistan, and the credibility of the Doha process, should be measured not by whether the Taliban choose to participate, but by whether the UN and Member States can meaningfully coalesce around a clear, transparent and non-negotiable set of principles upholding human rights, especially women’s rights and women’s participation. We urge you not to concede to any of the Taliban’s stated conditions for participation that would undermine addressing the protection of women’s human rights or the full, robust and regular participation of diverse Afghan women civil society in any decision-making about their country’s future, including the Doha process.

Ahead of Doha III, we further urge you to ensure the following:

Women’s rights must be a central topic of discussions in Doha. Respect for women’s rights must be a core objective of the international community’s engagement on Afghanistan, and a standing agenda item at all upcoming and future discussions in Doha. Women’s rights must also be addressed in discussions on any other aspect of the situation in Afghanistan, such as the humanitarian crisis, a political process, climate change, counter-narcotics, counter-terrorism, the economy and development efforts.

Respect for women’s rights must be a core objective of the international community’s engagement on Afghanistan, and a standing agenda item at all upcoming and future discussions in Doha. Women’s rights must also be addressed in discussions on any other aspect of the situation in Afghanistan, such as the humanitarian crisis, a political process, climate change, counter-narcotics, counter-terrorism, the economy and development efforts. Principled engagement requires centering human rights and accountability. We urge Member States to coordinate and establish clear safeguards around the following principles: The full spectrum of women’s human rights must be respected, without exception, in accordance with Afghanistan’s international obligations,[4] including under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). All restrictions violating the rights of Afghan women and girls, including, but not limited to, education, work, movement, assembly, expression and dress must be immediately and unconditionally removed in accordance with Resolution 2681 (2023). Women’s full, equal, meaningful and safe participation in all aspects of public life and decision-making, including in any political process, must be guaranteed. All humanitarian actors and their donors must ensure safe, gender-responsive, principled and non-discriminatory humanitarian delivery to all Afghans in need. This requires calling on the Taliban to immediately lift the ban on Afghan women working for the United Nations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), which is in violation of the UN Charter and CEDAW; supporting the full and safe participation and leadership of women and women-led organizations in humanitarian decision-making and delivery; ensuring that women aid workers are not replaced by men; and increasing support to humanitarian organizations, particularly those led by Afghan women. The targeting of all human rights defenders, including women protestors and civil society, peacefully exercising their freedom of expression and assembly, must end immediately. Perpetrators of violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, including gender persecution and other abuses targeting diverse women and girls, must be held accountable.

We urge Member States to coordinate and establish clear safeguards around the following principles: The international community should reiterate its clear and unified demand for the Taliban to swiftly reverse all policies and practices that restrict the enjoyment by women and girls of their human rights and fundamental freedoms, as per Resolution 2681 (2023), and refrain from sending any countervailing signals that downplay the seriousness of the human rights crisis in the country. Afghan women have been clear that the international community must refrain from granting the Taliban a seat at the UN or inviting them to UN-convened meetings, reopening diplomatic missions in the country or handing over diplomatic missions outside of Afghanistan to them, or lifting sanctions—all of which risk legitimizing a regime that continues to violate women’s human rights, Afghanistan’s international legal obligations, and Security Council resolutions. International experts have further called on Member States to avoid normalization or legitimization of the Taliban until there is demonstrated, measurable and independently verified progress on all human rights, especially women’s rights.[5]

International experts have further called on Member States to avoid normalization or legitimization of the Taliban until there is demonstrated, measurable and independently verified progress on all human rights, especially women’s rights.[5] The full, equal, meaningful and safe participation of diverse women civil society and human rights defenders is essential to the legitimacy of the meetings in Doha. Meeting to discuss Afghanistan without half its population represented undermines both the Doha process and its outcomes, as well as any future engagement strategy by the international community. We therefore urge you to ensure that diverse Afghan women, including women human rights defenders, peacebuilders, protestors, youth, and those representing ethnic, religious, LGBTQI+, persons with disabilities and other marginalized groups, are full participants in all discussions and processes in Doha and beyond; that they have regular, and multiple, avenues and opportunities to express their views; that their recommendations are reflected in any outcomes; and that there is full transparency regarding both these processes and their outcomes so that Afghan women and civil society have clarity about how their perspectives inform the international community’s approach to Afghanistan.

The proposed UN Special Envoy for Afghanistan, due to be appointed, must be the principled voice of the international community. The Special Envoy must have a strong track record on human rights and women’s rights, as required by Resolution 2721 (2023); include senior gender and human rights expertise on their team; regularly and meaningfully engage with diverse Afghan women civil society and human rights defenders; and ensure that their views inform all aspects of the Envoy’s work.

While members of the international community are moving perilously close to accepting the legitimacy of Taliban rule, Afghanistan’s women, who are bravely fighting back and paying a devastating price as a result, are not. We urge you to do everything in your power to support them.

Sincerely,

Kaavya Asoka

I’d like to report a missing person. Actually, more than a million of them, missing for a thousand days.

In September 2021, the Taliban prohibited girls from attending school beyond sixth grade in Afghanistan. The following year, they expanded the ban to universities, blocking women students from finishing their advanced education.

These bans are on top of other severe restrictions on women and girls to work, to travel, and to even leave their homes. It’s the most serious women’s rights crisis in the world and has been condemned by international experts as “gender apartheid.”

The absence of girls and women from secondary and university education is obviously a tragedy for the individuals concerned. Women throughout Afghanistan describe their situation as isolation and suffocation, drawing comparisons to “living in prison-like conditions.”

But the policy is also a punishing blow to the country as a whole.

“Afghanistan will never fully recover from these 1,000 days,” my colleague and expert Heather Barr says. “The potential lost in this time – the artists, doctors, poets, and engineers who will never get to lend their country their skills – cannot be replaced.”

Missing people, missing talents, missing dreams, missing lives.

This happens in no other country. Afghanistan is the only state in the world that bars girls and women from secondary and higher education. Only the Taliban thugocracy is so viciously anti-women that they hinder their country’s advancement and progress by blocking half the population from participating in society.

It’s like running a marathon and deciding to saw off one of your legs before the race begins.

There are brave girls and women defying the Taliban by attending underground schools, but clearly that can’t overcome all the losses, both personal and to society as a whole. We need to see more effort from the outside world, as well.

At the end of June, UN experts and envoys on Afghanistan will meet in Doha, Qatar, to continue to discuss the international community’s approach to Afghanistan. It’s an opportunity to stand with Afghan women and avoid doing anything that might look like trivializing the serious human rights crisis or legitimizing the Taliban regime.

Afghan women have been clear about what should be done. The international community should hold the Taliban accountable for their crimes against women and girls. They must not, for example, invite them to UN-organized meetings. No one should lift sanctions on the regime until there’s verified improvement in human rights, especially women’s rights.

Anything less risks normalizing the widespread terror of the Taliban regime.",VERY HIGH,20240610T143000Z,International experts,Heather Barr,Taliban,Afghanistan,"Hold Taliban accountable, maintain sanctions until improvements are verified",Severe restrictions on women's education and rights,Afghanistan,Taliban's ideology and policies

Feature Script:

SOUNDBITE: Jalia Hedhil [Mejid’s wife]

Mejid is a person I can't describe, he's got a great personality and a very big heart. Mejid was arrested in 2015 for writing bounced checks. The hardships of [prison] deeply impacted him, and he is no longer the strong person he once was.

SOUNDBITE: Siwar Hedhil [Mejid’s daughter]

We were always together, my childhood memories are filled with moments spent with him. Then of course when he went to prison, things were no longer the same. We write poems and stories to each other. I realized that I could express my pain in an artistic way. This helped me break out of the isolation and depression I was feeling.

SOUNDBITE: Jalia Hedhil [Mejid’s wife]

Siwar was her Daddy’s girl and still is. They were inseparable.

VO:

Mejid Hedhil is a former contractor who had a construction business. In 2010 he was hired by a Tunisian Ministry to renovate a building in the Kasbah quarter of Tunis, where several government ministries are located.

SOUNDBITE: Jalia Hedhil [Mejid’s wife]

Our life was very good and we suddenly hit rock bottom.

VO:

Things began to change for Mejid’s business at the beginning of 2011. Mejid had to cease operations on site due to the protests in the Kasbah quarter of Tunis.

SOUNDBITE: Jalia Hedhil [Mejid’s wife]

Suppliers quickly learned that Mejid was facing financial difficulties, prompting them to cash their checks simultaneously. The situation caused Mejid to struggle significantly.

VO:

Acquiring goods from a supplier in exchange for a check to be cashed later is a widespread practice in

the Tunisian commercial sector. It means business owners like Mejid can carry out commercial transactions at a given time, even if they are unable to pay for the goods or services right away.

VO:

Under this practice, a supplier provides a merchant with an informal loan secured by a check that they commit to cash at a later stage rather than immediately. This is a widely used business model,

popular in particular with small enterprises.

SOUNDBITE: Siwar Hedhil [Mejid’s daughter]

Checks play a crucial role in driving the economy forward.

SOUNDBITE: Jalia Hedhil [Mejid’s wife]

We were waiting for a partial payment of 400,000 dinars (119,000 euros)...

SOUNDBITE: Jalia Hedhil [Mejid’s wife]

...[with that money] we could have covered checks and paid suppliers.

SOUNDBITE: Jalia Hedhil [Mejid’s wife]

If he had been paid, Mejid would have been able to settle his debt.

SOUNDBITE: Jalia Hedhil [Mejid’s wife]

When Mejid was arrested, our situation was unstable and I couldn’t afford a lawyer. This financial strain significantly impacted Mejid’s defense.

SOUNDBITE: Siwar Hedhil [Mejid’s daughter]

Now, he has been in jail for nearly 10 years. The checks law is unfair.

VO:

According to the government, 496 people are currently in detention due to failed checks, nearly all of whom were entrepreneurs. How can you take steps to repay if you’re in jail?

VO:

Tough economic times have only aggravated the problem. Today, Tunisia is still in the midst

of a severe economic crisis, with significant inflation, a lack of liquidity and heavy foreign debt. This impacts smaller businesses more than most.

SOUNDBITE: Jalia Hedhil [Mejid’s wife]

Society judges you badly based on appearances, without understanding the full truth of a situation.

SOUNDBITE: Jalia Hedhil [Mejid’s wife]

I hope the president will address bounced check issues and help families reunite. Words can't fully describe the catastrophic situation.

VO:

Imprisonment solely for owing debt is a violation of international human rights law. Not only it deprives indebted people of their freedom, it impacts their physical and mental health, but also harms their families who face stigma, and whose living conditions deteriorate

as a result of the imprisonment.

SOUNDBITE: Siwar Hedhil [Mejid’s daughter]

When my dad went to prison, money became a real problem. We struggled to afford our basic needs

and sometimes went days without food.

SOUNDBITE: Siwar Hedhil [Mejid’s daughter]

[The government] promised that he'll be pardoned and freed, pledged reform, said he'll get paid.

VO:

The authorities need to assess each case individually, and release those imprisoned who are unable to pay their debts, allow their rehabilitation, and support them in a planfor settling their debts.

SOUNDBITE: Siwar Hedhil [Mejid’s daughter]

I hope the law will be revised, and better solutions will be implemented, because imprisonment isn't a solution.

SOUNDBITE: Siwar Hedhil [Mejid’s daughter]

I hope my dad leaves prison and the truth comes to light.

(Nairobi) – Police in Tanzania guarding the North Mara Gold Mine have been linked to the killing of least six people and injury of several others during clashes since February 2024, Human Rights Watch said today. The Tanzanian authorities should promptly undertake independent and impartial investigations into the killings and other abuses in northern Tanzania’s Tarime district.

The police have accused those killed and injured of “invading the mine” and conducting illegal small-scale mining inside the mine’s premises. The police have made no arrests related to these abuses.

“The growing number of unaccounted for killings connected to Tanzania’s North Mara Gold Mine reflect a worrying pattern of impunity for abuses that needs to be addressed,” said Oryem Nyeko, senior Tanzania researcher at Human Rights Watch, “The Tanzanian authorities should not sweep these deaths under the rug but should ensure that those responsible are held to account.”

In 2014, the Tanzanian government entered into an agreement with the North Mara Gold Mine Limited company to guard the mine with up to 110 police officers, referred to as “mine police” by community members, on an ongoing basis. Rights groups and community members have reported that in the years since this agreement, police officers have been responsible for beating, shooting, torturing, and detaining without charge residents of areas near the mines and dumping areas. The police accuse the residents of theft from the mine and its surrounding waste rock dumping sites.

Barrick Gold, a mining company headquartered in Toronto, Canada, and the Tanzanian government have jointly owned the mine since 2019. The area is inhabited by Indigenous Kurya people who have conducted small-scale local mining on the land for centuries. In 2022, 21 Tanzanians sued Barrick Gold before a Canadian court, accusing the company of being complicit in extrajudicial killings and beatings of residents by police assigned to the mine. They alleged that the company converted the police operating in and around the mine “into a private and heavily armed security force.” A preliminary hearing in this case has been scheduled for October.

In the past four months several deaths and injuries have been reported for which no arrests have been made. The police reported that on February 28, Jackson Nyamonge, a 28-year-old resident of Nyamwaga village, was found dead at the mine fence with injuries to his chest and stomach. On April 7, local media reported that police shot Sylvester Sobhe Marwa Nyangige in the head during a security operation at the mine. A copy of a police form, seen by Human Rights Watch, cites “unnatural death” as the circumstances of his death. On April 26, police allegedly shot and injured Pascal Malembara in the leg in the Murwambe area.

On May 6, the police confirmed the death of Emmanuel Nyakorenga, a resident of Kewanja village, at a primary school near Nyabigena village, close to the mine. The police told the media that he was part of a group of people with “traditional weapons” who had attacked the police officers who were preventing them from unlawfully entering the mine.

A witness described the killing of Nyakorenga, telling Human Rights Watch that around 6pm police officers chased several people from an area near the mine’s Gokona pits into the Nyabigena Primary School playground, about 500 meters from the mine. The police allegedly shot tear gas, sound bombs, and live bullets at the group, injuring some.

Shortly after Nyakorenga was fatally shot, the officers fled and residents of the area began to block the main road near the school in protest of Nyakorenga’s killing. Police later returned and dispersed the crowd, using tear gas. Nyakorenga’s relatives said that a postmortem examination found what looked like a bullet in his head, but that the officials who conducted the exam did not provide them with further information.

Since May 6, residents have reported the deaths of at least three other people in the area. The day after Nyakorenga’s death, residents reported that they found the body of an unidentified person at a mine dumping area outside the mine premises. On May 22, the media reported that Babu Christopher Iroga, a resident of Mjini Kati village, and July Mohali, a resident of Nyangoto village, were killed during a confrontation with police. The police accused the men of stealing from the mine.

John Heche, a former member of parliament for Tarime district, told Human Rights Watch that police abuses have intensified in the recent years, saying: “For a few years these deaths have been occurring, but never at this magnitude. People are being shot almost every day.”



Barrick Gold said in a June 11 response to a request for information from Human Rights Watch on June 4 that the company “does not, and cannot, have any de facto control over the police and their actions,” and that the “police are requested to enter the mine site to assist in upholding law and order” when their employees' lives are in danger. The company said that it is “not in any way involved or aware of [Tanzania police force] activity in the community, nor can it be responsible or accountable for it simply because such activity occurs in geographical proximity to the North Mara Gold Mine.”

Barrick Gold’s human rights policy states that it does “not tolerate violations of human rights committed by our employees, affiliates, or any third parties acting on our behalf or related to any aspect of one of our operations,” and that it does its “utmost to avoid being complicit in adverse human rights impacts, including benefitting from the human rights violations caused by others.”

Under the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, companies have a responsibility to avoid causing or contributing to human rights violations and to provide remedy to victims of abuses to which they have caused or contributed.

The UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials require police to use nonviolent means before resorting to force and firearms. While law enforcement officials have a duty to protect lives and property, they should only use force when unavoidable and in a proportionate manner, and use lethal force only when absolutely necessary to save lives.

Standing in a sunbeam from an open window, the young Afghan boy pointed to where children had found a landmine hidden under a burlap bag in their classroom.

The mine was not entirely unexpected, the teacher told me: the Taliban had recently posted a note in the local mosque ordering all schools enrolling girls to close. But the mine didn’t convince the teacher to close the school. Instead, she brought the students into her home. “It’s a challenge for me and I will never stop this school,” she said.

At the time — it was 2005 — I thought that violent attacks on students and schools were a uniquely Afghan problem. Today, we know such attacks happen in almost every armed conflict around the world, from Gaza to Ukraine and beyond. Every year, thousands of students and teachers are killed and injured, schools are destroyed, and children are denied the future that only an education can deliver.

There are 120 countries that believe this is unacceptable. They’ve all signed the Safe Schools Declaration, an international political commitment to protect education during war. Sadly, the United States isn’t one of them.

Reasons for attacking schools during conflict vary. Teachers and schools are highly visible, so they’re easy targets. To rebel groups, they may be symbols of the state. Attackers may oppose who or what is being taught, or simply see schools as good places to abduct children to conscript into their forces, indoctrinate, or rape. Our research has found that schools are also often targeted when they’re being used for military purposes, such as bases or barracks, and become lawful targets for attack.

This global problem demands a global solution. That’s why in 2015, countries joined together to initiate the Safe Schools Declaration. By endorsing the Declaration, countries agree to put their political muscle behind children and their education. They promise to investigate and prosecute attacks that violate the laws of war, help victims, try to continue safe education during wartime and restore access after attacks, and protect schools from military use.

The Safe Schools Declaration is working. It has brought public attention to attacks on education, raised awareness of the harmful consequences of militaries using schools, and increased stigma around both. More militaries are showing they can engage in combat without putting education on the battlefield. They are understanding that military use of schools costs more strategically than it gains because it loses “hearts and minds” and undermines international aid money for education.

Over a dozen countries have revised their military guidance to ensure more protection for schools and education, including Denmark, Ecuador, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Ukrainian authorities, in the face of the full-scale Russian invasion, issued a high-level military order to avoid using schools. Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Kenya have prosecuted people responsible for attacking schools. Alongside these countries, UN peacekeepers have nearly stopped deploying in schools.

Key UN officials have also urged countries to endorse the Declaration.

What’s baffling is that the United States ostensibly supports all the elements of the Safe Schools Declaration. The U.S. military already includes schools in its official “no strike” lists, recognizing that schools not being used for military purposes are protected civilian property under the laws of war. Other agencies of the U.S. government already fund education before, during, and after conflicts.

What’s more, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the guardian of international humanitarian law, says it supports the Safe Schools Declaration because while the Declaration does not change the laws of war, it improves compliance with them. So even Pentagon lawyers who hone close to the letter of the law have nothing to be concerned about.

The United States should also recognize the strategic value of signing on. Its main military allies have already endorsed the Declaration and found it feasible. Endorsing the Declaration would help preserve the significant U.S. investment funding education globally, when the schools it builds are not turned into military barracks or destroyed in fighting. An endorsement would put the U.S. on the right side of a global movement to protect schools from attack, one that is already making such a difference in war-affected countries.

Signing a declaration that protects schools and education during wartime should be an easy sell for the U.S. government. The Declaration couldn’t be more timely or relevant, including for Gaza, given Israel’s recent bombing of a UN school there, which Israel claimed was a Hamas compound. Upholding girls’ education was a popular justification for U.S. involvement in Afghanistan, and U.S. investment helped educate thousands before the Taliban’s return to power.

Today, the United Nations marks the first International Day of Play, designed to recognize the vital importance of play, particularly for children’s development. It’s a chance to remember what is often described as a forgotten right, perhaps because many adults view playing and leisure as a luxury, or falsely assume it’s a given in every child’s life.

Playing is essential for children’s cognitive, emotional, social, and physical development. It teaches children to self-regulate and form relationships with their peers and caregivers, and is inextricably tied to early learning. In humanitarian crises, many children also rely on play to cope with and recover from hardship.

All children have a right to play, as laid out in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the most widely ratified international human rights treaty. But Human Rights Watch research has found that many children cannot play safely or adequately, and some cannot play at all.

In the United Kingdom, accommodation used to house people seeking asylum, often for months, is frequently unfit for children to play. Families reported a lack of space and uncrowded areas being recurrent problems. This can affect children of all ages, from babies and toddlers learning to crawl, to teenagers hoping to enjoy recreational activities.

In Kabwe, Zambia, a town notorious for its extremely high levels of lead pollution, children face disastrous health risks when playing outside, because the soil on which they are playing is the main source of lead exposure in the town and its surrounding areas. This is due to contamination from a former lead and zinc mine that the government has still not cleaned up.

Some governments have violated children’s right to play sports. In Saudi Arabia, girls have only been allowed to play certain sports since 2018 and still face significant barriers limiting their participation in sports and physical activity. Since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, thousands of girls have also been denied the right to play sport. And in countries like Japan, Haiti, and Mali, children have faced significant abuse, including corporal punishment and sexual and gender-based violence, while engaging in sports.

Last month, discussing Japan’s foreign policy, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said that “our role is to actively shape an Asia and a world where human dignity is respected, and a free and open international order based on the rule of law is maintained and strengthened, ensuring that we pass these values on to future generations.”

This is a pivotal year that will test those aspirations and Japan’s commitment to human rights as the country sits on both the United Nations Human Rights Council and the U.N. Security Council.

Meanwhile, in Asia at large, human rights remain under steady assault from abusive governments.

A military coup and spiraling conflict in Myanmar have claimed thousands of civilian lives and displaced more than 3 million people. The Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan has intensified widespread human rights violations, normalizing severe gender discrimination and the persecution of women and girls.

One-party rule in North Korea, China and Vietnam has long deprived their populations of freedom of expression, association and assembly. Meanwhile, entrenched political interests in Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan have weakened civic institutions and electoral processes.

Nearly everywhere in the region, the space for civil society and media freedom is shrinking.

Japan should use its seats on U.N. bodies effectively and actively show leadership to protect human rights by building strong coalitions with other like-minded governments. Western countries like the United States and United Kingdom are focused on their own domestic issues in the lead-up to national elections. They have also lost credibility due to their selective application of human rights principles.

While Japan has clout as a well-established, stable and prosperous Asian democracy and as a generous development donor, it uses that leverage too sparingly and selectively. The government should do more to address human rights concerns across the region, starting with mobilizing action on North Korea, China and Myanmar.

North Korea represents one of the world’s worst human rights situations — right on Japan’s doorstep. Furthermore, since the COVID-19 pandemic, Pyongyang has sealed its northern border, exacerbating the country’s isolation and worsening abuses.

Given the long history of North Korea’s abduction of Japanese citizens, Japan previously led a successful call at the Human Rights Council for a commission of inquiry into crimes against humanity in North Korea.

It has been 10 years since the commission published its landmark report. In the decade since, not only has Pyongyang failed to implement the commission’s recommendations, but has accelerated its nuclear weapons program, risking international peace and security in defiance of the U.N. Security Council.

In March, Russia vetoed the renewal of a panel of experts' mandate to monitor the enforcement of the Security Council’s sanctions against North Korea. While the veto was an attempt to impair the ability of governments to receive updates about the regime’s weapons programs and human rights and humanitarian situation, it actually provides an opportunity to strengthen the U.N.’s scrutiny.

Japan should work with South Korea, the U.S. and others to bolster the link between security and rights, recognizing that North Korea’s repression exacerbates the humanitarian crisis and is what enables the weapons program to exist. These governments should lead efforts at the U.N. General Assembly to commission an impartial and independent expert team to address the links between North Korea’s extensive record of human rights abuses, the threat that the regime poses to international peace and security and its illicit activities in defiance of U.N. resolutions.

Meanwhile, the Chinese government has evaded accountability for its serious human rights abuses such as the arbitrary detention of ethnic Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang, forced relocations and religious repression in Tibet, the dismantling of democracy in Hong Kong, and widespread censorship, surveillance and repression nationwide. In August 2022, the U.N. human rights office issued a damning report concluding that alleged rights violations in Xinjiang “may constitute crimes against humanity.”

But in the two years since, there has been no follow-up because Beijing refuses to acknowledge the abuses and has railed against efforts to discuss the matter at the Human Rights Council.

As a first step, Japan should work with a small group of countries to lead efforts for a joint statement at the Council condemning human rights violations in China. This would send a message that powerful countries that commit crimes cannot avoid scrutiny.

Japan should also urge U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk to brief the Human Rights Council on updates since the U.N. report’s publication and whether China has implemented the recommendations.

Shifting to Myanmar, the military junta there has been committing crimes against humanity and war crimes since the 2021 coup. Much of the country is an active war zone, with civilians caught in the crossfire. Earlier this year, the junta introduced conscription, which it has carried out abusively, and thousands have fled to avoid recruitment.

Stemming the flow of weapons and revenue to the military is key to compelling the junta to change course.

Japan has already condemned indiscriminate airstrikes and attacks on civilians in Myanmar and criticized the junta’s failure to release political prisoners. But it needs to follow up. Tokyo should support the U.K. and other like-minded governments at the Security Council in their efforts to impose an arms embargo on Myanmar, refer the situation to the International Criminal Court and impose targeted sanctions on military-owned companies.

Japan should also suspend all nonhumanitarian aid to Myanmar, since at least one Japanese company is continuing to make payments to a junta-owned conglomerate. Tokyo should send a clear message to its firms to comply with targeted sanctions on Myanmar-listed entities.

More broadly, Japan needs more diplomatic tools to protect human rights in foreign policy. For starters, the country should pass legislation to authorize targeted sanctions, including visa bans and asset freezes, against people implicated in serious human rights violations. Such a law would provide the flexibility to target individual rights abusers without broadly punishing countries’ populations.

Japan should also introduce a human rights due diligence law that would require companies to address rights violations such as forced labor in their supply chains. Some Japanese lawmakers have already recommended these changes, as Japan is the only member of the Group of Seven without such laws. Finally, the government should reinstate the role of human rights adviser to the prime minister — a position that Kishida created in 2021 but abruptly abolished last September.

Japan has strong trade and development links with many countries in the Global South, especially in Asia, and it has always prioritized engagement and dialogue as part of its foreign policy.

Still, Japan can do more to leverage those relationships by making consistent principled human rights arguments in both public and private diplomacy, ensuring that Japanese diplomats and senior officials meet regularly with civil society groups and encouraging other governments to work together to defend human rights.

Asia faces enormous challenges. But working with like-minded countries to combat repression and ensure rights protection is the best way of securing its future as a stable, prosperous region with transparent and accountable governments.

(New York) – India’s new government should reverse laws and policies that discriminate against religious minorities and other vulnerable populations and end the crackdown on civil society and the media, Human Rights Watch said today in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Modi was sworn in as prime minister on June 9, 2024.

The newly formed Indian government should adopt an agenda that actively promotes and protects human rights, advances the rule of law, strengthens democratic institutions, and upholds the right of every Indian to an adequate standard of living, including food, education, health, and social security.

“India’s new government should end the use of counterterrorism laws and other abusive measures that deprive activists, journalists, and others of their rights,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The government should engage with its critics, protect freedom of expression and assembly, and provide room for dissent instead of silencing opponents.”

The Indian government should take concrete steps to protect fundamental civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights. Human Rights Watch said. These include free expression and association for civil society; digital rights, including the right to privacy; ending violence and discrimination against religious minorities and vulnerable groups; ending violence against women and girls; improving access to education; ending impunity for security forces; protecting the rights of people with disabilities; protecting the rights of refugees and asylum seekers; ensuring that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people are able to experience all fundamental rights without discrimination; and adopting a rights-focused foreign policy.",HIGH,20240611T040000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Narendra Modi, Elaine Pearson",Indian government,India,"Adopt a rights-focused agenda, protect civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights.","Discrimination against religious minorities and vulnerable populations, and crackdown on civil society and media.",India,"Political repression, discrimination based on religion, inadequate protection for civil rights"

(Taipei) – The Chinese government has suppressed fundamental freedoms in Hong Kong in the five years since protesters began occupying city streets on June 12, 2019, and staged months long pro-democracy demonstrations, Human Rights Watch said today. The authorities have since arrested over 10,000 people for their involvement in the protests, prosecuted 2,910 of them, and convicted 1,475, according to government figures.

Foreign governments should seek to hold Hong Kong and Chinese officials responsible for abuses to account, including by imposing targeted financial and travel sanctions.

“Five years since the Hong Kong protests, the government has offered no apology and provided no accountability for police abuses while promoting those responsible for violence to lead the city,” said Maya Wang, acting China director at Human Rights Watch. “Hong Kong is now a city where any criticism of the police or call for justice for that abuse could land one in prison.”

In February 2019, Hong Kong authorities proposed revisions to Hong Kong law to allow extraditing criminal suspects to mainland China, where due process rights are routinely flouted. On June 9, over one million people demonstrated peacefully against the extradition amendments.

On June 12, tens of thousands gathered around the Legislative Council (LegCo), Hong Kong’s semi-democratic legislature, and occupied the adjacent roads. The Hong Kong police fired tear gas, beanbag rounds, and rubber bullets to disperse the protesters, leading to dozens of injuries. Hong Kong’s then-Chief Executive Carrie Lam condemned the protests, calling it “a riot.”

Over the next six months, Hong Kong people staged near-daily protests to press for their “five demands:” withdrawal of the extradition bill; retraction of the official characterization of the protests as “riots;” amnesty for arrested protesters; an independent inquiry into alleged police misconduct; and full universal suffrage for Hong Kong people, as promised by Beijing.

While Hong Kong authorities eventually scrapped the proposed legal amendments, they ignored other demands, including calls for an investigation into police use of excessive force. No officers alleged to have used wrongful force during the 2019 protests have been held accountable. Lam insisted that the existing police complaints mechanism – which is part of the police force – was adequate.

The protests took place throughout the city and often involved large numbers of people. In the largest, on June 16, 2019, organizers estimated that two million people took to the streets in a city of seven million.

“From students and teachers to laborers and lawyers, from activists to teenagers and octogenarians, a large cross-section of Hong Kong society took part in widespread acts of civil disobedience,” Wang said.

Protesters organized strikes, formed 4,000 new labor unions, demonstrated outside police stations, occupied the Legislative Council and the airport and its surrounding streets, and held hands forming a 50-kilometer “Hong Kong Way.” They placed ads in major newspapers around the world, spoke at the United Nations, and pressed foreign governments for support.

The Hong Kong police increasingly used excessive and indiscriminate force against largely peaceful protesters in violation of international human rights standards. Officers fired projectiles including pepper balls, tear gas canisters, and rubber bullets at protesters, including at close range and at people’s faces, causing injuries including blindness.

They fired tear gas inside enclosed spaces, including subway stations and shops; beat protesters on their heads, and chased them in dangerous situations that could have caused stampedes; rammed police vehicles into crowds; and unnecessarily tackled demonstrators to the ground, including pregnant women, children, and older people.

Police on two occasions fired live ammunition at protesters. Some protesters alleged that they were beaten and mistreated in custody, while one said police officers had raped her. Some accused the police of deliberately failing to act when suspected criminal gangs attacked protesters. One protester, Alex Chow Sze-Lok, died during a police operation under circumstances that remain disputed.

The Progressive Scholars Group in Hong Kong reported 1,200 cases of alleged police brutality during the protests between June 9, 2019, and January 21, 2020. Some protesters also took up more violent tactics over time, throwing bricks and Molotov cocktails at the police, and damaging properties owned by pro-Beijing businesses. One pro-Beijing man was set on fire while bricks thrown by protesters killed another.

In December 2019, a group of foreign experts quit the Hong Kong police review bodies out of concern that they lacked the authority to address the abuses related to the protests. In November 2020, the Hong Kong High Court ruled that the government had violated its Bill of Rights by not providing an independent mechanism for complaints about the police. That month, an independent policing expert from the United Kingdom who had quit the Hong Kong review bodies published a report concluding that the indiscriminate use of force by the Hong Kong police escalated the 2019 protests.

As of June 2024, the Chinese and Hong Kong governments have gutted Hong Kong’s civil liberties by imposing two draconian national security laws, crushing the city’s pro-democracy movement by detaining and prosecuting elected representatives, eliminating civil society groups and independent labor unions, and shuttering pro-democracy media, among other measures.

Hong Kong’s abusive police force has gained greater authority and impunity under the leadership of Chief Executive John Lee, a former senior police official, and security chief Ping-Keung Tang, both responsible for the suppression of the 2019 protests. And the Beijing-controlled Hong Kong courts have handed down baseless convictions against pro-democracy leaders and activists; some will face heavy sentences, up to life in prison.

While many foreign governments have expressed concerns about the deteriorating human rights situation in Hong Kong, few have taken concrete action, Human Rights Watch said. In 2020, the United States imposed sanctions on Hong Kong officials for the 2019 abuses, the only government to do so. In the face of continuing repression in Hong Kong, foreign governments should impose sanctions on police officials responsible for the crackdown, Human Rights Watch said.

“Foreign governments should respond to the continued impunity for 2019 abuses against pro-democracy demonstrators by imposing targeted sanctions on senior Hong Kong police officials,” Wang said. “Doing so will send the right message and change the calculations of those leaders intent on turning a once-free society into a highly oppressed state.”",HIGH,20240611T040000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Maya Wang, Carrie Lam, John Lee, Ping-Keung Tang, Alex Chow Sze-Lok","Hong Kong and Chinese government, Hong Kong police",Hong Kong,"Imposing targeted sanctions on police officials, independent inquiry into police misconduct and accountability.",Suppression of fundamental freedoms and police brutality against pro-democracy protesters,Hong Kong,"Proposed extradition law, desire for democratic freedoms, police violence during protests"

From Afghanistan to Bangladesh to India and the Maldives to Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, there is remarkable agreement across the region amongst experts on sexual violence about what needs to change.

Survivors of sexual violence, especially girls and women from marginalized communities, face sometimes insurmountable barriers to justice.

Vrinda Grover, Lawyer, India

If you overlay gender with the location of the victim survivor woman, through her caste, working class women, women who are from the religious minority, she finds it almost impossible to access justice because overlaid with all the structural and systemic hurdle is institutional bias.

When governments fail to respond effectively to sexual violence, survivors suffer and the abuses continue.

When somebody is speaking about their experience, there are people in the community who would go and bully them. You know, make them believe that it’s their fault.

The judges still consider the victim as a criminal, and they ask a lot of the questions that is against the human dignities.

Dr. Lhamo Yangchen Sherpa, Expert, Nepal

It’s not only that the police registers the case. You then have to go to the court which might take years and years. That’s why most of the people, they either do not report or the cases are resolved outside the court.

In Bangladesh, it is estimated that less than 1 percent of rape cases investigated by police lead to conviction.

Umama Zillur, Founder and Director of Kotha, Bangladesh

At the village level, where you have an informal justice system, one of the most common ways of resolving rape cases there is by deciding that let’s marry off the victim survivor to the rapist.

Ambika Satkunanathan, Former Human Rights Commissioner, Sri Lanka

Women do not want to make complaints and seek redress because of the socio-cultural pressures. But what this does, it also causes great trauma

Some government leaders in the region have argued that the solution is to execute rapists.

Pakistan’s prime minister called for rapists to be executed in public.

Bangladesh recently amended a law to add the death penalty for rape and Indian law already permits this in certain circumstances.

The experts agree that this is no solution.

Shabnam Salehi, Human Rights Commissioner, Afghanistan

As a human rights activist, I’m not in favor of the death penalty.

Farieha Aziz, Co-Founder of Bolo Bhi, Pakistan

Just a few years ago, a child was raped and murdered and her convicted rapist and murderer was given the death penalty, but that has not stopped other cases of child abuse or of sexual violence.

Umama Zillur, Founder and Director of Kotha, Bangladesh

Since it is a severe form of punishment for an and all type of rape it will reduce conviction rate across the board.

Ikleela Hameed, Founder of Voice of Children, Maldives

When our justice system is not so strong, a death penalty sentence may actually result in the death of an innocent person.

Vrinda Grover, Lawyer, India

Death penalty is not a deterrent for any crime, including sexual violence. It lets the state off the hook from doing the work that the state needs to do in order to ensure that women and girls live free lives in this country.

Governments need to do more to prevent sexual violence, proved services and support to survivors, and remove barriers to justice.

Umama Zillur, Founder and Director of Kotha, Bangladesh

One thing we have been advocating for and fighting for is comprehensive sexuality education to be made mandatory in all our schools.

We do have laws and we do have certain procedures. What is necessary is that they are implemented.

Everything in this world has a foundation. Without a foundation, it is weak, and it will collapse. It is important to have a foundation for education and that is nursery. It will therefore be good for the government to lay a strong foundation for education for all children.

— a parent from Kawempe, Kampala

James Muhindo (not his real name) is a “boda boda” motorcycle driver in Tokora, Nakapiripirit. He would like to send his five-and-a-half-year-old son to pre-primary school but said he cannot afford the fees. “I don’t have money to take him to nursery,” he said. “There is a pre-primary school nearby but they [charge] 30,000 [Uganda Shillings, UGX; US$8] for nursery. It is a private school.... My son cannot read and write. He cannot speak English.… There are these people who are rich who are taking their children to school. For the poor, things remain like that.”

In Uganda, fewer than 1 in 10 pre-primary aged children (ages 3-5) are enrolled in a formal pre-primary school, and 60 percent attend no school at all. The government does not provide any public pre-primary education (often called “nursery”), so families seeking education for their young children must rely on private providers that can charge prohibitive fees. For example, in Kampala, these fees can reach UGX 1,750,000 (US$462) or more per child per term. For a full school year—three terms—fees for just one child at this rate represent more than two years’ wages for an average person in paid employment in Uganda and exceeds the annual tuition for many programs at Uganda’s leading university, Makerere University.

Parents interviewed for this report said they paid from UGX 5,000 ($1.35) per child per term in rural Nakapiripirit in the Karamoja subregion to UGX 800,000 ($215) per child per term in Kampala, the capital city. Some parents said that the high cost of pre-primary education in Uganda meant that their children missed out on pre-primary education all together or stopped attending when they became unable to continue paying fees.

Children from low-income and rural families are most likely to miss out on pre-primary education. Private pre-primary schools are concentrated in urban areas with higher-income families, where schools are more easily guaranteed adequate income. In 2019, the adjusted net attendance rate in schooling of 5-year-olds in Uganda was more than 17 percent higher for children in urban areas than in rural areas, and 49 percent higher for those in the richest quintile than those in the lowest-income quintile. More than half of children in the poorest 20 percent of households never attend a day of pre-primary.

The disparities in access to pre-primary schooling for low-income and rural families have lifelong consequences and exacerbate Uganda’s wealth inequality. Children who miss out on pre-primary do not perform as well in primary school as their peers who attended pre-primary and are more than twice as likely to repeat grade 1 at the primary school level. They are also more likely to drop out of school entirely. Children who miss out on these foundational skills may never catch up to their peers. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), “educational inequalities start early in life and disadvantages accumulate over the lifecycle.”

Early childhood learning has profound long-term benefits for children’s cognitive and social development, their health, future educational attainment, and employment and other opportunities later in life. The pace of brain development is at its highest in the first years of life, so this period represents a critical opportunity to make a positive difference in children’s lives.

Pre-primary education also mitigates inequalities among children from families of different incomes and contributes to countries’ economic development. Access to pre-primary education improves employment prospects and earnings, resulting in increased tax revenues and GDP. Between 1980 and 2021, public expenditure on education accounted for 50 percent of global economic growth and 40 percent of extreme poverty reduction. A 2023 cost-benefit study of pre-primary education in Uganda concluded that “investments in early childhood have the greatest rate of return of any human capital intervention.”

In Uganda, every schilling invested in pre-primary education can bring up to UGX 16 in benefits, including improved lifetime earnings, new employment opportunities, and reduced primary school repetition rates. Greater access to pre-primary schooling also increases the employment and income of parents, by allowing them—particularly mothers—to enter or re-enter the workforce earlier.

For this report, the Initiative for Social and Economic Rights (ISER) Uganda interviewed 102 Ugandan children, parents, teachers, and education officials regarding access to pre-primary education in Uganda. Interviewees identified a wide range of benefits of pre-primary education for children, including the development of their personalities, mental and physical abilities, social skills, and preparation for success in primary school.

A father of four children in Mukono district said that pre-primary school “helps a child to get start-up knowledge like spellings of words which ignites his learning at primary level.” A Kampala tailor said that nursery school “gives the child confidence to respond and answer questions.… By the time they join primary, they are fully prepared and don’t find serious challenges.” A pre-primary teacher said: “Pre-primary education stimulates the kids’ thinking. Kids develop their talents and are able to interact with their peers.”

Experts at Uganda’s Ministry of Education and Sports also agree. Hajat Safina Mutumba, the Principal Education officer for pre-primary education at the Ministry of Education provided a litany of benefits, enumerating how early childhood education boosts children’s cognitive and social skills, helps children become emotionally intelligent, promotes mathematical and scientific reasoning, improves their concentration spans and problem-solving skills, builds their confidence, and prepares them for lifelong learning.

Both teachers and students observed differences in primary school between children who attended pre-primary and those who did not. A 16-year-old boy in Gulu said: “Those who did not study did not know how to write their names, for me I knew because it was the first thing they teach in nursery.” A teacher in Mukono district said: “Those who attended nursery education are always far better than those who missed nursery learning.” Another teacher from Nakapiripirit district said: “When you compare the literacy competence of those who attended pre-primary and those that did not, there is a difference.”

Research supports these observations. A survey by Makerere University of 5,000 grade 6 students from all parts of Uganda found that students who had 13 to 24 months of pre-primary education had better reading and numeracy skills than children who did not benefit from a pre-primary education.

Many parents interviewed for this report described their inability to afford pre-primary fees for their children or the financial hardships they experienced to send their children to nursery. A grandmother who sells groceries at a Kampala market pays for her 5-year-old grandchild to attend nursery school and will send a younger grandchild when she gets older. She said: “They could not start earlier because the mother did not have money.... My grandchildren attend only one year in nursery school. I cannot afford to pay for the three years.” A mother of six in Omoro district works as a subsistence farmer and says: “I always struggle to find the money. For some of my children, they did not finish all the levels because I could not afford fees for every term.”

Some parents said they wanted to send their children to all three years of pre-primary, but could only afford one or two years. Others said they had to discontinue their child’s pre-primary education when they were no longer able to pay the fees. Some said there was no pre-primary school available in their area.

The cost of pre-primary education is often much greater than the costs associated with primary school. For example, a mother of three in Kampala said that pre-primary cost her five times as much as primary school: “Imagine, I paid UGX 55,000 ($15) per term per child at Kasubi Family Primary School (a public primary school implementing Universal Primary Education). But at nursery, I had to pay UGX 300,000 ($81) per child per term.”

Because pre-primary school is more expensive than primary school, many parents enroll their children in primary school before the usual age of 6, even though the children are underage and not prepared. Data show that 20 percent of Ugandan children aged 5 are already enrolled in primary school. Early enrollment in primary school creates overcrowded classes, exacerbates inefficiencies in the education system, and increases repetition rates. According to UNICEF, excessive repetition can result in 1.2 extra years of education per child and an estimated 5–10 percent of the education budget wasted.

Some parents who enroll their children early fully expect their children to have to repeat grades. A mother of eight children in Nakapiripirit sent several of her children to primary school at age 4. She said: “When you take the child to start school, they face challenges. Failing in class is automatic.” Nonetheless, parents often feel they have no alternative.

Nearly all of the family members and teachers interviewed for this report expressed a preference for free, public pre-primary education. A grandmother paying for her granddaughter’s pre-primary education said: “Just like they provide UPE (Universal Primary Education), they should do the same for nursery.... It should be universal nursery education.” A mother in Kampala said: “Nursery schools need to be under the control of government.... Every parish should have a nursery school.” A father in Mukono district with five children said that if free pre-primary school was available, “I should enroll immediately ... Why can’t we have free schools?”

A small number of parents interviewed expressed skepticism about the value of pre-primary education. One teacher from Nakapiripirit said: “Before, Karamoja was not into education, it is now that they are waking up.… [Parents] need to be sensitized.”

In 1997, Uganda declared that primary school education would be free for all children. This Universal Primary Education (UPE) policy opened school doors to millions of children. Between 1997 and 2018, primary enrollment more than tripled from 2.8 million to 8.8 million. Ten years later, in 2007, Uganda became the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to introduce universal secondary education (USE).

Despite these significant advances, Uganda’s educational system is underfunded, and outcomes are poor. Only 40 percent of children complete primary education and only 16 percent complete upper-secondary education. The government’s 2022 Education Partnership Compact with its development partners cited high drop-out rates, poor educational achievement, insufficient and inadequately prepared teachers, and too few schools in some areas. Classes are often over-crowded and teacher absenteeism is rampant. The funding provided by the government to local schools (called capitation grants) is often insufficient to cover costs, prompting local schools to impose informal fees on families that create financial barriers and fuel high drop-out rates.

As part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, governments made a commitment at the 2015 World Education Forum in Incheon, Republic of Korea to allocate 4 to 6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) to education and/or to allocate at least 15 to 20 percent of public expenditures to education. Uganda’s investments in education are far below these benchmarks and are also below its regional peers. Uganda’s education budget—UGX 4,447 billion for fiscal year 2023/24—accounts for only 8.4 percent of the total national budget. By contrast, neighboring Kenya and Tanzania both allocate more than 18 percent of their national budgets to education. Government-funded education makes up only 1.9 percent of Uganda’s GDP, significantly below the regional average of 4 percent and falling well short of the international benchmarks that advise spending 4 to 6 percent of GDP on education.

Uganda’s Vision 2040 reaffirmed universal primary and secondary education as a human right, and its 2022 Education Partnership Compact commits to progressively increasing resources for the education budget as part of efforts to transform Uganda’s educational system. The Ugandan government has also recognized pre-primary education as a foundation for further education and set a goal that all children in Uganda should have the opportunity to complete at least one year of quality pre-primary education. President Yoweri Museveni has called for the establishment of an early childhood development center at every UPE school.

A commitment to provide free, inclusive, and quality pre-primary education for all children in Uganda will require significant resources but will also help strengthen Uganda’s overall education system. For example, expanding access to pre-primary education in Uganda could reduce Primary 1 repetition rates by 50 percent, and just one year of free and compulsory pre-primary education is associated with a 12-percentage point increase in primary school graduation rates in low- and lower-middle-income countries. Universal pre-primary education also results in cost savings at primary and secondary education levels by making education systems more efficient. A 2023 cost-benefit analysis estimated that 90 percent of the costs of scaling up pre-primary education in Uganda could be covered through savings from reduced repetition rates and underage enrollment in primary school. Research in various African countries similarly suggests that investments in early childhood care and education can be offset by up to 87 percent because of higher efficiency within primary education alone.

The Ugandan government should strengthen its efforts to ensure that all children enjoy free, quality, and inclusive education, including by making adequate investments in its education budget. Under international human rights law, states are obliged to take steps to the maximum of their available resources to progressively realize economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to education. Multiple analyses have found that Uganda can do more than it does now to secure adequate resources for education, including by widening its tax base, improving compliance with existing tax laws, revisiting tax exemptions, curbing illicit financial flows and other forms of corruption, among other measures.

As part of its commitment to the right to education, Uganda should make t least one year of pre-primary education compulsory and free for all children and should establish government-funded pre-primary units at every primary school implementing universal primary education. Over time, it should make additional years of pre-primary education free for all children.

Every child has a right to education, which should be fulfilled from early childhood without discrimination. Children’s access to pre-primary education should not depend on their parents’ ability or willingness to pay fees. All children should have access to education at this critical point in their lives and be able to reap its lifelong benefits.





Recommendations

To the Government of Uganda

Establish government-funded pre-primary units at every primary school implementing universal primary education.

Make at least one year of pre-primary education compulsory and free for all children, and make additional years free over time, as expeditiously as possible.

Immediately increase financial investment in the public education sector bearing in mind international benchmarks established in the 2015 Incheon Declaration and Framework for Action to dedicate 15 to 20 percent of the national budget to education, and the obligation to use maximum available resources for the realization of rights, including the right to education, and specific funding targets for pre-primary education.

Increase revenue for allocation to public education through progressive and fair taxation, and curbing illicit financial flows, other forms of corruption, and unjustified tax exemptions and tax abuse.

To the Ministry of Education and Sports and Parliament

Amend Section 10, subsection 2 of the Education (Pre-Primary, Primary, and Post Primary) Act of 2008 to obligate the government to fund and implement universal pre-primary education.

To the Ministry of Education and Sports

Until pre-primary education is provided free of charge, the Minister of Education should issue a statutory instrument to regulate school fees in pre-primary schools to increase access to pre-primary education for the greatest possible number of children.

Expand capacity for training and accreditation of teachers at pre-primary level at government teachers’ colleges and recruit trained and qualified pre-primary teaching personnel.

Conduct public education campaigns on the value of pre-primary education for children’s development and educational success.

Effectively regulate the private educational sector, ensuring that all pre-primary or “nursery” schools and private primary schools with pre-primary classes are licensed, registered, and regularly monitored to ensure compliance with education law and standards. Increase resources within the Ministry of Education and Sport to ensure ministry officials have more resources to conduct necessary oversight and regulation of private actors.

To the National Curriculum Development Centre

Develop a unified national curriculum for pre-primary education in a participatory process involving pre-primary teachers, parents, school administrators, experts in early childhood education and other stakeholders. The curriculum should be widely disseminated to all pre-primary schools, and teachers and staff should be trained on how to use it.

To Uganda’s Development Partners

Meet the global target of dedicating 0.7 percent of gross national income to aid, including allocations for pre-primary through secondary education.

Provide technical assistance and development aid specifically to assist the government of Uganda in establishing a universal pre-primary education system.





Methodology

This report is based on research conducted between July 2022 and January 2024. Researchers from the Initiative for Social and Economic Rights in Uganda (ISER-Uganda) conducted 102 interviews with children, parents and other caregivers and guardians; school principals, teachers, and other school staff; and education and other government officials. The 26 children interviewed included 15 girls and 11 boys and were aged 8 to 17. The 38 school personnel interviewed included school principals and pre-primary and primary school teachers at both private and government primary schools.

Interviews were conducted in Kampala, Uganda’s capital, located in the south of Uganda, as well as Nakapiripirit and Omoro districts in northern Uganda, and Namayingo district in eastern Uganda. These locations were chosen to encompass both urban and rural areas and higher- and lower-economic areas.

Interviews were conducted in person in English, Luganda, Lusoga, Acholi, and Samia.

ISER-Uganda researchers informed all interviewees about the purpose and voluntary nature of the interviews, the ways in which they would use the information, and that interviewees could decline to answer questions or could end the interview at any time. The interviewees received no inducement, payment, service, or other personal benefit for the interviews.

In addition, ISER-Uganda researchers visited 23 pre-primary facilities, representing a variety of approaches to the provision of pre-primary education in Uganda, including private institutions that required the payment of tuition and other fees; private institutions that provided tuition-free education; government public primary schools with attached pre-schools run as income generation for the primary school teachers; institutions with Christian and Islamic religious affiliations; and one public pre-school institution, at Makerere University, which is primarily for the children of university staff.

Human Rights Watch conducted additional interviews with experts from non-governmental organizations and academics and reviewed secondary sources, including Ugandan government policies and reports; reports from UNICEF, UNESCO, the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and other United Nations entities and international groups; and academic and other sources.

Terminology

In this report, “child” and “children” are used to refer to anyone under the age of 18, consistent with usage under international law.

According to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) definition, pre-primary education programs are designed to include educational content for children aged 3 years up to the start of primary education, which in Uganda, is age 6.

This report uses the term “pre-primary” to refer to education for children aged 3 until the entry into compulsory primary school at age 6, in line with Uganda’s Education Act of 2008. In Uganda, pre-primary education may also be referred to as “nursery school,” “preschool,” “kindergarten,” or “baby school.” These terms may be used when quoting individuals interviewed for this report.

In many instances in this report, the term “teacher” is used to refer to individuals who have teaching responsibilities in pre-primary schools. These refer to individuals who may or may not have qualifications in early childhood education.



I. Uganda’s Education System

Uganda’s 1995 Constitution guarantees all persons a right to education. A child “is entitled to basic education which shall be the responsibility of the State and the parents of the child.” The state is required to “promote free and compulsory basic education” and “take appropriate measures to afford every citizen equal opportunity to attain the highest educational standard possible.”

Under Uganda’s 2008 Education Act, the education system for children consists of three years of pre-primary education, seven years of primary education, and six years of secondary education. Seven years of education is compulsory, beginning at age 6.

Primary and Secondary Education

In Uganda, primary education typically begins at age 6. The government of Uganda introduced “Universal Primary Education” (UPE) in 1997, formally abolishing primary school tuition, Parents and Teachers Association fees, and textbook fees for up to four children per family. The removal of fees prompted a surge in the number of children attending school: Primary enrollment more than tripled from 2.8 million in 1997 to 8.8 million in 2018. To cover costs at the school level, the government allocates capitation grants—funding provided to schools on a per student basis to pay for instructional materials, co-curricular activities, and school maintenance.

In practice, however, primary education is still not completely free even at UPE schools and the government reports that cost is the primary reason for school dropout. Education personnel and parents interviewed for this report said that parents had to pay Parent Teacher Association fees, registration fees, learning materials, salaries for non-teaching staff such as security guards, and even toilet paper. ActionAid reported in 2017 that families sending their children to public school in Uganda paid up to 33 percent of their household income for school-related costs.

According to ISER-Uganda’s research, the Ugandan government does not allocate sufficient funding to education and to ensure that capitation grants correspond to real enrollment. Consequently, government primary schools charge non-tuition fees to meet or reduce the funding gap.

In 2007, Uganda became the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to introduce universal secondary education (USE). The initiative was intended to make secondary education more accessible, particularly for the increased number of children graduating from primary school. As part of a public-private partnership, the government began to provide subsidies to private schools to make them more affordable for students and families.

The number of secondary schools increased by 26 percent from 2,373 in 2007 to 3,000 in 2017, with the private sector seeing the greatest growth of 34 percent. Secondary enrollment increased from 1.23 million students in 2009 to 1.37 million in 2017.

The introduction of universal primary and secondary education expanded access to education for millions of children. Despite gains in enrollment, however, completion rates are poor. The latest data from UNESCO indicates only 40 percent of children in Uganda complete primary education, 34 percent of children complete lower-secondary education, and 16 percent complete upper-secondary education.

In May 2021, Uganda’s government launched an Education Policy Review Commission to review the current education system and propose reforms. As of early 2024, the review was still underway. ISER-Uganda’s analysis is that under-investment in education, coupled with increased enrollment and access, has placed a strain on essential elements needed to guarantee quality education, such as classrooms, teachers, and instructional materials. This has negatively affected the quality of education at all levels—thus undermining primary completion rates, reducing children’s school preparedness and progress, and exacerbating drop-out rates, especially for girls.

Weaknesses in the public education system have also fueled the growth of private alternatives. About 21 percent of primary school students are enrolled in private schools, and the rate grew at an average of about 1 percent per year between 2009 and 2019. At the secondary level, 51 percent of students are enrolled in private institutions. In the analysis of ISER-Uganda, the burgeoning of private schools has not been matched with an effective regulatory framework, and their number exceeds the capacity of the education ministry to effectively regulate and monitor.

Pre-Primary Education

The Pre-Primary, Primary and Post-Primary Education Act of 2008 recognizes pre-primary as the first level of education and gives the Ministry of Education, Science, Technology and Sports responsibility for oversight. Under the law, however, pre-primary education is not required to be provided free of charge. The law states that pre-primary education is “to be run by private agencies or persons to provide education to children aged from two years to five years and the financing of that type of education shall be a responsibility of the parents or guardians.”

According to the latest available government data, only 9 percent of pre-primary aged children (ages 3-5) in Uganda attend a registered and licensed preschool. Studies suggest that only 18 percent of Uganda’s early childhood care and education centers are registered, meaning that they meet minimum standards, and that a further 26 percent are licensed (meaning they have made an application but have not met quality standards). The remaining 56 percent are neither registered nor licensed. Household surveys indicate that more than 60 percent of 3-5 year-olds in Uganda are not attending school of any kind.

In 2019, there were 28,194 pre-primary schools operating in Uganda, enrolling 2,029,441 children (1,020,941 girls and 1,008,500 boys). Pre-primary schools are run by individual investors, community groups, civil society organizations, international NGOs, and faith-based organizations, operating both as for-profit and not-for-profit establishments. Although some pre-primary schools are attached to UPE schools, they are not government schools and usually charge fees. The only government-funded pre-primary school in Uganda is at the School of Education at Makerere University for children of university staff. The nursery’s teachers are paid by the university, a public institution.

Children go through three classes at the pre-primary level. Different providers might use terms such as “baby class, middle class, and top class,” “kindergarten I (baby class), kindergarten II, and kindergarten III” or simply “class I, class II, and class III.” Children may attend pre-primary for one, two, or three years, depending on the age of entry.

According to a 1992 government white paper on education in Uganda, pre-primary education should aim at developing the capabilities and healthy physical growth of children; help the child develop good social habits as an individual and as a member of society; to develop moral values; to enrich the child’s experiences by developing imagination, self-reliance, and thinking power; help the child appreciate his or her cultural background and customs; and develop language and communication skills in their mother tongue. Uganda’s National Curriculum Development Center—an autonomous statutory institution under the Ministry of Education—has developed a learning framework for 0-6 year-olds which provides guidance on key benchmarks for early childhood education, but there is no standard national curriculum for pre-primary education.

Although the government does not fund pre-primary schools, it funds a department that coordinates, provides policy direction, monitors, and oversees the implementation of pre-primary education. The Ministry of Education is also responsible for registering and licensing nursery schools and monitoring the education sector. Monitoring is delegated to district education officers, who report to the ministry through the basic education department.

Uganda’s Commitment to Free Pre-Primary Education

In December 2016, Uganda launched a National Integrated Early Childhood Development (ECD) Policy and Action Plan. The plan endorsed the role of “integrated ECD services” for every child in Uganda as “a critical and fundamental strategic step towards achieving Vision 2040.” Launching the plan, President Yoweri Museveni called for the establishment of at least one quality ECD center in every village across Uganda by 2020, and said: “I would like to see that every Universal Primary Education school has a quality ECD centre.”

In 2020, the government reiterated this goal in its report to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, stating that it was planning and working to expand community-based ECD centers and to attach them to primary schools, and working to develop and implement a comprehensive ECD policy framework.

The Ugandan government’s commitment to education also includes a 2022 Education Partnership Compact, a shared agreement between the government and education development partners to implement policy reforms on priority areas to transform Uganda’s education system. The compact “recognizes that quality pre-primary education forms the foundation for primary education and that quality primary education is, in turn, foundational for a transition to more equitable, relevant, and higher-quality secondary education.” The compact includes an aspiration for “all children in Uganda to have the opportunity to complete at least one year of quality pre-primary education.”





II. The Benefits of Pre-Primary Education

I liked and enjoyed the time in nursery.… At break time we took porridge.… Nursery level can open the mind to think.

— a 14-year-old boy from Omoro district

A growing body of research has found that early childhood learning can have profound long-term benefits for children’s cognitive and social development, educational attainment, health, and employment prospects. The pace of children’s brain development is at its highest in the first years of life, so this period represents a critical opportunity to make a positive difference in children’s lives. Emerging evidence finds the benefits of pre-primary education are not only lifelong but cross-generational.

Access to early childhood education can mitigate inequalities among children from families of different incomes. According to UNICEF, universal access to quality pre-primary education narrows early achievement gaps for children from disadvantaged households and places them on a more equal footing with their well-off peers. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) states that increasing low pre-primary enrollment can yield “large positive returns over an individual’s entire lifetime, particularly for the most disadvantaged.”

Pre-primary education can particularly benefit children with disabilities, including by strengthening their capacity to benefit from education, promoting their enrollment and attendance, and reducing stigmatizing and discriminatory attitudes against them.

Education has a multiplier effect, enabling children to realize the full range of their rights, become responsible adults, and contribute positively to society. It plays a powerful role in reducing rates of child marriage, child labor, and other child rights abuses. Pre-primary education also helps children develop resilience to cope with traumatic and stressful situations, such as conflict and other emergencies.

Pre-primary education also has significant benefits for economic development. It improves children’s employment prospects and average earnings, which can boost tax revenues and GDP, and reduce public service expenditures in law enforcement, medical care, the justice system, and child welfare. A 2021 IMF survey on public expenditure and inclusive growth found that “[i]nvesting in early childhood education and care has been shown to yield some of the largest returns.”

Students, parents, teachers, and government officials interviewed for this report identified a wide variety of benefits for children from pre-primary education, including the development of their personalities, talents, mental and physical abilities, and social skills, and preparing them for success in primary school.

A trader in the informal sector in Kampala said he had sent four of his seven children to pre-primary school—the other three were still too young. He said:

Children need to start in nursery because at that stage, they are still growing mentally and learning a number of things such as washing hands.… The nursery teachers give those things attention and by the time the child goes to primary, his or her mental capacity has grown. Nursery also prepares a child to join primary level especially the change in environment from home to school. The child gets to learn discipline.

A casual laborer in Mukono district who also has a small firewood business worked hard to put his first four children through pre-primary education, and is now paying for his fifth and youngest child to attend. He said the value of pre-primary education for his children was that it “helps a child to get startup knowledge like spellings of words which ignites his learning at primary level.” He said: “I sacrifice a lot to ensure that all my children go to school.”

A Kampala tailor who sent his two children to nursery, said: “The child is offered a good foundation to learn some English and writing. At nursery, my children could greet in English. The learning at nursery also gives the child confidence to respond and answer questions. They prepare them and by the time they join primary, they are fully prepared and don’t find serious challenges at primary level.”

A mother in Omoro district who sent five of her six children to nursery school observed: “The child who attended pre-primary, you cannot compare them to the one who did not because they can easily socialize with their friends.”

Teachers—both in nursery school and in primary school—were among the most enthusiastic in speaking about the benefits of early childhood education for children, echoing international studies that show positive gains in social, linguistic, and physical development for children attending pre-primary.

“Oooh, there are many!” answered a teacher at a joint nursery and primary school in Tokora subcounty in Nakapiripirit, when asked if there were benefits for children in going to nursery. “One, it helps the child to socialize with others. Also makes the child learn how to read and write early. The child gets used to the school environment before joining primary.”

A pre-primary teacher in Omoro district said: “Pre-primary education stimulates the kids’ thinking. Kids develop their talents and are able to interact with their peers.” Another teacher at a primary school said: “There are a number of benefits that a child gets when he or she attends pre-primary school. The social life of a child. A child will also get leadership skills because they train them to lead. Capability of a child to speak fluently. It also makes a child to be assertive. It also helps a child to have self-esteem. It helps a child to know how to read and write some good words.”

Christine Akumu teaches at an early childhood development center in Omoro district that offers three levels of classes. She is also a member of the Parent Teacher Association at the local Palenga primary school. She says that when she visits the primary school, she sees that children who attended nursery school “are always the best.”

Teachers interviewed for this report often linked the social development acquired in nursery school with children’s better performance in primary education. For example, a primary school teacher in Nakapiripirit said: “A learner who has attended pre-primary becomes very easy to handle when it comes to primary education in terms of communication and the behavioral part of it—he or she is social. The child comes when he or she has had an opportunity to interact with fellow learners. Pre-primary lays a strong foundation for these children.... Those who attended pre-primary, socially and morally, they find life easy at school.”

Education officials, who have perhaps the broadest perspective on the benefits of education, also spoke positively of the developmental benefits they see for children who attend nursery. Hajat Safina Mutumba, the principal education officer for pre-primary education at the Ministry of Education and Sports provided a litany of benefits, enumerating how early childhood education boosts children’s cognitive skills, helps children become emotionally intelligent, develops their socialization skills, promotes mathematical and scientific reasoning, improves their concentration spans, and builds their confidence. Emphasizing the benefits of learning through play, she said such an approach helps children develop holistically, develop problem-solving skills, and prepares children for lifelong learning.

In addition to the foundational effect on children’s socialization and holistic growth, research from around the world shows that children who benefit from a quality pre-primary education have better academic outcomes later in life, starting in primary school. Researchers from Makerere University in Kampala have made similar findings with respect to Ugandan students: They surveyed more than 5,000 grade 6 students from around the country and found that students who had between 13 and 24 months of pre-primary education had better reading and numeracy skills than children who did not benefit from a pre-primary education. According to UNICEF, attending an early childhood education program is one of the strongest predictors for supporting a child’s readiness for school, regardless of household or national income level.

Children interviewed also identified positive impacts that they experienced from attending pre-primary school, compared to their peers who did not go to pre-primary. A 16-year-old boy in Omoro district in northern Uganda, said, “I saw the difference.... Those who did not study did not know how to write their names, for me I know because it was the first thing they teach in nursery.” A 14-year-old boy from Omoro district who attended nursery said that all children should be able to attend pre-primary before going on to primary school. “Nursery level can open the mind to think,” he said. “When you join without attending nursery, you perform badly.”





III. The Negative Consequences of Pre-Primary Fees

Almost all pre-primary schools in Uganda require parents or guardians to pay tuition fees for children to attend. Parents and teachers interviewed for this report provided examples of such fees, ranging from UGX 5,000 (US$1.35) per child per term in Nakapiripirit, to UGX 800,000 ($215) per child per term in Kampala. Fees can be significantly higher. For example, some pre-primary schools in Kampala advertise fees of UGX 1,750,000 ($460) per term, or UGX 5,250,000 per year for one child – more than the annual tuition for many programs at Makerere University.

Tuition fees are often supplemented by additional fees for building maintenance, application fees, school uniforms, or supplies. A father in Kampala who pays UGX 380,000 ($102) per child per term, said the total of these additional costs was another UGX 70,000 ($19). He said: “I would manage to pay the school fees because the school allowed us to pay in installments. At the start of the term, we would pay 60 percent of the fees and then pay the remaining balance later.”

In rural areas, schools may require the provision of food or other items. For example, a mother in Omoro district said she pays UGX 85,000 ($23) per term, and also provides the school with 20 kilograms of posho (maize flour), 10 kilograms of beans, and 4 kilograms of rice. A mother in Nakapiripirit said she provided one kilogram of sugar per child.

The fees for pre-primary represent a significant expense for most Ugandan families. For example, fees of UGX 300,000 per child per term—paid by several parents interviewed in Kampala—total 900,000 per year and represent four and a half months’ wages for an average Ugandan in paid employment.

The cost of pre-primary education can be much higher than the cost of primary school. For example, a mother of three in Kampala said that pre-primary cost her five times as much as primary school: “Imagine, I paid UGX 55,000 ($15) per term per child at Kasubi Family Primary School [a UPE school]. But at nursery, I had to pay UGX 300,000 ($81) per child per term.” The headmistress at a mixed nursery and primary school in Kampala said that parents paid UGX 90,000 ($24) per term for their children attending primary but paid nearly four times as much—UGX 350,000 ($92) per child—for their children in pre-primary.

Children, parents, teachers, and officials interviewed for this report identified pre-primary fees as a key barrier to pre-primary education, particularly for children from rural and lower-income families. Children without access to pre-primary are also more likely to perform poorly in primary school, and experience higher repetition and drop-out rates.

Children Miss Out on Pre-Primary Education

Only 9 percent of pre-primary aged children attend a licensed and registered pre-school,

and more than 60 percent of pre-primary-aged children in Uganda are not attending any type of school. For many parents and guardians, tuition or other fees are an insurmountable barrier to sending children to school. This is particularly the case for those with little income, and those working in the informal sector, including subsistence agriculture and low-paid manual work.

All parents interviewed for this report who did not send their children to pre-primary school cited the inability to pay for it as a key reason for their decision. Previous studies have also identified cost as the major barrier to pre-primary education in Uganda. For example, a 2017 study in two districts found that a large majority of parents interviewed—73 percent in Mbale district and 93 percent in Kumi district—said that their inability to pay for pre-primary school was the reason for their decision not to send their children.

A mother in Kampala, who works as a food vendor at a market, sent her youngest child to nursery but did not send her first child. She explained: “My first child did not go to nursery school. I did not have money to pay school fees.” If a free pre-primary option had been available, she said, “I would have taken my children to that school.”

Many parents delay their child’s entry into pre-primary school because of the required fees. One mother of three children said: “I did not have enough money to pay for all the three years of nursery school. So I had to wait until each of my children made 4 years before they could join nursery school.”

Another mother of three children said her youngest child is currently in “baby class,” but that he is the first of her children to benefit from pre-primary education, as she could not afford to send the older children. She is paying UGX 165,000 ($44) per term for her son’s preschool, as well as fees for her older children in primary school. “I pay the school fees in installments. I find difficulty in raising the money for all the three children … I want government to regulate school fees as there are no government nursery schools.”

A woman who sells groceries at Kampala’s Kamwokya Market is currently paying for her 5-year-old grandchild to attend nursery school and plans to send a younger grandchild to nursery as well. “I take them when they are 5 years such that they study for one year and go to P.1 [Primary 1]. They could not start earlier because the mother did not have money.… My grandchildren attend only one year in nursery school. I cannot afford to pay for the three years.” She said that if free pre-primary was available, “I would enroll them at 3 years [old].”

Teachers also see how the cost of pre-primary education constitutes a barrier for many families. Prossy Nassanga, a pre-primary teacher at a private school in Mukono said that the fees charged at her school were UGX 240,000 ($65) per term. She said the fees were comparable to those of other nearby schools, but nonetheless “scare away some parents” who cannot manage the fees.

Christine Akumu teaches at a fee-paying early childhood development center, which was started by an NGO in 2000. There are at least three nursery schools in the area, but many pre-primary-aged children do not attend because of tuition and associated costs. “So many children do not go to school. [Parents] say it is too expensive to pay for children in nursery, so they wait for Primary 1,” said Akumu. Another pre-primary teacher similarly said: “The first thing that demotivates parents is poverty. Because K level [nursery level] is mainly provided by the private and since most parents have no money, they prefer to keep the children home and enroll them directly in P.1.”

The district inspector of schools in Omoro district expressed dismay “that the cost of attending nursery is higher than primary,” and explained that from what he sees from the district level, even in locations where nursery schools were available, “a parent will therefore decide to wait for primary.”

Interrupted Education

Even if parents and guardians can initially afford fees to enroll their children in pre-primary education, fees may later become unaffordable, particularly if the parent’s income is not steady or predictable. In such cases, the school may send the child home, or the parent is forced to remove their child from the school. The result is an interrupted education in the early years, a key period for children to learn key foundational skills and benefit the most from continuous immersion in early learning.

A mother of six in Omoro district works as a subsistence farmer. The local nursery school charges UGX 50,000 ($13) per child, and she said: “I always struggle to find the money. For some of my children, they did not finish all the levels because I could not afford fees for every term.”

An electronics businessman in Mukono district in central Uganda said he pays UGX 350,000 ($94) per term for his child to attend the “baby class” at a local nursery. He said that his child had been sent home from school when he was unable to pay the fees on time, and he pays with difficulty “because business is not always good.”

A pre-primary teacher in Omoro district explained that pre-primary enrollment was low in her area, and that “when the school sends a pupil back home for fees, the parents just leave them to stay at home and they never return.” She said that parents often identified crop failures for their inability to pay fees. Another pre-primary teacher in Omoro agreed, saying, “At the beginning they start very well, but when the term progresses and you ask them for fees, they leave,” she said. A teacher at a UPE school in Namayingo district that charges UGX 30,000 per term for pre-primary said: “Payment of fees is a challenge. Every week you see teachers sending the learners away.”

Omoro’s district inspector of schools, James Boniface Acellam, explained that the weather-dependent nature of agricultural work in that region resulted in inconsistent schooling. At some nursery schools in the district, he said, parents pay the fees with a mix of cash and products—“for example 10 kilograms of beans, maize flour, 2 kilograms of sugar, 10 rolls of toilet paper, and after buying those things they pay UGX 20,000 to 30,000 [$5-8] per term.” But he noted that in 2022, “This season has not been good because of the drought. The yields were not good. They are not in the position to raise 10 kilograms of maize or beans. By this season our people would be selling produce, but drought has been too much. I am worried in the third term the ECDs (early childhood development centers) will close.”

Poorer Performance in Primary School

Education data and interviews for this report found that overall, children who do not attend pre-primary school do not perform as well in primary school as children who attend pre-primary. Dan Kyagaba, the director of the Uganda National Examinations Board, shared that a study in the 2000s compared students in primary three and six who had not attended nursery and those who had attended nursery, and found “that learners who had attended nursery performed better than those that did not attend nursery.”

Medadi E. Ssentanda, a lecturer at Makerere University in Kampala who has studied the challenges of literacy acquisition in Uganda, says that for rural children who do not have the chance to attend preschool, “Bridging the two-year-gap of their counterparts in private schools is very challenging and in many cases impossible.... The elective preschool provision is currently creating a huge gap between learners within a single education system.”

A farmer in Namayingo district said that two of his four children attended pre-primary school. He said, “When a child starts direct in Primary 1 things are hard. You see that the one in Primary 1 who went to nursery is better than one in P.5 who never went to nursery.”

A 13-year-old girl in Primary 7 said that when she entered primary school without first accessing pre-primary, “I didn’t know anything at the time when I started to study. Even how to write is difficult and reading.” A 9-year-old boy who also missed out on pre-primary noticed he was different from the other children who were younger and had attended nursery school: “I was not clever like them. The other children could read and write better than me.” Another boy, age 10, said his mother told him that he did not attend pre-primary because she did not have enough money to pay for it. He said that when he entered primary school, he struggled with reading, writing, and speaking English. “Things were difficult for me. I was not understanding,” he said.

Teachers interviewed for this report indicated that children who attend pre-primary school are generally better prepared for primary school. A head teacher at a primary school in Kampala said: “Some parents enroll their children direct in Primary One without attending pre-primary. However, such pupils have challenges socializing with others, toilet habits, writing-tool handling [holding pencils and using them], sounds, reading, drawing, and paying attention to the teacher.” In contrast, he said that children who attend pre-primary education gain abilities in these areas “to kick-start their learning” in primary school.

A primary teacher at a private school in Mukono district noted that when children do not have access to pre-primary, teachers may need to do extra work to mitigate the negative impact. She gave an example of one student in primary school who had not been able to attend nursery school: “His parents did not have money to pay fees at the time he was supposed to join nursery. I had to give him special consideration by sparing time to teach him what he missed in nursery to catch up with the rest of the learners who went through nursery education.”

Premature Primary Enrollment

Because pre-primary education is so expensive, some parents enroll their children in primary school earlier than the usual age of 6. According to available data, 20 percent of children aged 5 are already enrolled in primary school.

A 2017 study in the Mbale and Kumi districts of Uganda found that 28 percent of parents interviewed said that they sent their children “early” to P.1 instead of to pre-primary. These parents often do so despite the knowledge that their child may not perform well. For example, 56 percent of the parents sending their child to primary early said they expected that their children might have to repeat P.1 and 67 percent expected that their children would likely learn less the first time through P.1.

The premature enrollment of children in primary school also creates large classes and can result in extra work for their teachers, who are forced to manage overcrowded classrooms with very young children who are not developmentally ready for primary education. In some schools, Primary 1 classes may have as many as 300-400 students, with only one teacher.

A farmer from Namayingo district said that she could not afford to send any of her four children to pre-primary. Instead, she enrolled them in primary at age four. She said: “They face difficulties understanding. Their performance is not good.” A casual laborer from the same district said that several of his six children started primary school at age four, but that they repeated classes. He said: “They were all challenged because they did not understand well. It took them long to understand.” As a result, he enrolled his youngest child in pre-primary “to understand things early.”

Hajat Safina Mutumba, Uganda’s principal education officer for pre-primary education at the education ministry explained: “When you go to most UPE schools, there are high numbers in Primary 1. There are always streams—A, B, C—and the actual number of Primary 1s are in stream A and for the rest of the streams, their age is for pre-primary. However, schools do not disclose that they have learners of pre-primary school age in Primary 1.”

Higher Rates of Repetition in Primary School

Research conducted in Uganda in 2016 found that children who did not attend pre-primary school were more than twice as likely to repeat Grade 1 at the primary-school level as children who had attended pre-primary. Fifty-two percent of the children who did not attend pre-primary repeated first grade, compared to only 23 percent of children who had pre-primary experience. The research found that for children attending pre-primary, the reduction in repetition was the same for boys and girls.

Government officials, teachers, and parents interviewed for this report also observed that children who did not attend pre-primary school were more likely to repeat primary school years than students who had attended pre-primary.

One mother has four children in primary school but could only afford to send two of them to nursery school. She noted that the two children who did not attend nursery school had to repeat the second year of primary school. A mother of eight children in Nakapiripirit sent two of her children to nursery, but others started in primary school as young as age 4. She noted that primary school was difficult for her children who did not first attend pre-primary education: “When you take the child to start school they face challenges. Failing in class is automatic.”

Vincent Makali, the acting district education officer in Namayingo district, said that for children who do not have access to pre-primary, “There is a lot of repeating classes, especially in Primary one.” Robert Ikwap, Uganda’s assistant commissioner for primary education, said that parents who cannot afford enrolling their children in pre-primary send them instead to Primary 1 in UPE schools, but observed, “Such children rarely progress to Primary 2 [without repeating grade 1].” Similarly, Hajat Safina Mutumba, Uganda’s principal education officer for pre-primary education at the education ministry said: “The learners are still in the system because a teacher will not promote a child of four years to go to Primary 2.”

Higher Drop-Out Rates

Children who do not have access to pre-primary school may be more likely to drop out of school than children who attend pre-primary. Uganda’s 2022 Education Partnership Compact notes that “poorly prepared learners without access to pre-primary education contributes to low primary-level learning outcomes, repetition, and dropout.”

Hajat Safina Mutumba, the Ministry of Education’s principal education officer for pre-primary education, said:

If children do not attend nursery and come straight to primary where we expect serious business, even when they are bright [clever], they are affected psychologically as well as their learning. When children are not prepared well before joining primary, they struggle and even get bored because they cannot get on well at primary level and end up repeating. Some of the learners who didn’t attend nursery get demoralized and even end up dropping out of school.

UNICEF finds that in low-income countries, an increase in pre-primary enrollment is associated with a significant decrease in primary dropout rates. For countries that increase pre-primary enrollment from 25 percent to 75 percent, UNICEF estimates the cumulative dropout rate in the early grades will decrease from 40 percent to 22 percent.

Increased Inequality

Unequal access to pre-primary education can deepen education inequalities, and when access is tied to income, create significant long-term barriers and exclusion for children from the poorest households. UNESCO data for Uganda shows that children from higher-income families are far more likely to be enrolled in pre-primary than children from low-income families. In 2019, the adjusted net attendance rate in schooling of 5-year-olds from families in the richest quintile was 49 percent higher than those in the lowest-income quintile. More than half of children in the poorest 20 percent of households never attend a day of pre-primary. A head teacher at a nursery school in Kitante, a suburb of Kampala, acknowledged only parents “doing good jobs” were capable of paying their fees of UGX 350,000 (US$92) per child per term.

The benefits of pre-primary education are highest for children who may be at a greater disadvantage, including due to poverty, very low literacy levels among their parents, and little to no access to literacy or educational materials at home or their communities. These children are often the least prepared when starting primary school and are therefore most likely to struggle to catch up with their peers and lose learning throughout their schooling. The IMF has found that “educational inequalities start early in life and disadvantages accumulate over the lifecycle.”

When the provision of early childhood education favors higher-income households in urban areas and excludes lower-income poor and rural families on the basis of availability and ability to pay, inequality will inevitably be exacerbated. Bridging the gap of one to three years of foundational skills between children who benefit from a pre-primary education and those who do not is challenging, and for some may be impossible.

Uganda is a country with high wealth inequality. In 2019—the most recent data available—Uganda’s “Gini coefficient”—a statistical measure of income and wealth inequality—ranked the country as the 35th most unequal in the world in terms of wealth distribution, on par with Ghana, Paraguay, Madagascar, and Togo—all of which nonetheless offer at least one year of free pre-primary education.

Because pre-primary education in Uganda is almost exclusively private and fee-paying, families that are lower-income and who live in rural areas are least likely to be able to access it. In 2015, the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights expressed concern that Uganda’s reliance on private schools could result in discrimination, rising inequality, and “was a threat to children from low-income households, and for the development and social cohesion in the country.” The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights similarly expressed concern at the widening gap in access to quality education “resulting from the increase in the provision of private education and disproportionately affecting girls and children of low-income families.”

Unequal Access for Rural Children

In Uganda, most pre-primary facilities are located in urban areas, thereby excluding most of the population who live in rural areas. In its 2020 report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Ugandan government stated that 60 percent of early childhood development centers were located in the central and eastern regions of the country, and that this concentration “excludes over 80 percent of the population who are poor and live in rural areas.” Uganda’s National Service Delivery Survey of 2021 has also noted considerable variations in pre-primary enrollment by sub-region, particularly between the largely urban Buganda sub-region, and the Karamoja sub-region, which holds the lowest share of the population.

Uganda’s unequal distribution of pre-primary schools is in large part because pre-primary education providers are private, and it is easier to ensure fees are paid in locations with more concentrated populations of families able to afford them. In 2019, the adjusted net attendance rate in schooling of 5-year-olds in urban areas was more than 17 percent higher than in rural areas.

A 15-year-old boy in Primary 7 told us he did not attend nursery school “because in our village, there was no nursery school. And even the nearby villages didn’t have nursery schools. They have primary schools only.” A teacher at an early childhood center in Omoro district noted: “Some parents don’t take children to nursery because of distance. Schools should be in communities where children don’t have to walk long distances.”

Even when pre-primary schools are available, rural families are often less able to meet the required fees, due to lower incomes than urban families, or more precarious income streams. A mother of four in Omoro district, who earns money through farming, observed: “I plant crops, there can be drought affecting crops hence I get problem affording to pay. I can pay for two children and request to pay for the rest of learners later. Paying fees is a challenge. Even when we have grown soya, but price is low, it affects paying fees in time.”

A professional nurse and a father of four children in Omoro district said: “Government should first think of us in the villages. You will find that most times only those with money will take a child to nursery. Most people wait for children to reach the age of Primary One to take them to school. You find a nursery school charges UGX 280,000 ($74). If possible, government should come in and provide free nursery schools to villages because people there can’t afford. Private schools are expensive because they are profit driven.… Government should consider hard to reach areas because those are areas that don’t receive those services.”

The district inspector for school in Omoro noted: “We still have villages without ECDs.… In the past, attending nursery has been more of urban and luxury.… The levels of attainment of these children especially those that have not gone to ECD is not good. That is the reason you will find that our performance as a district is not good because of the nature of foundation at lower level. Because of that we are still far compared to other areas, for instance when results are out, schools in urban areas are better than those in rural areas.”





IV. Desire for Free Pre-Primary Education

Nearly all parents interviewed for this report, including those who paid to send their children to pre-primary school as well as those who said they could not afford to send their children, expressed a preference for free pre-primary education.

A casual laborer in Mukono district mentioned earlier in this report, worked hard to put his first four children through pre-primary education, and is now paying for his fifth and youngest child to attend. Asked whether he would make use of government free pre-primary education if it were available, he replied: “I should enroll immediately because it will be a favor to me. Why can’t we have free schools?”

A farmer from Namayingo district said she was only able to send one of her six children to pre-primary. She said that if the government offered free pre-primary, she would have sent all of her children. “All children should have to first go to nursery before going to primary because when they go to nursery first, they get motivated for education or learning,” she said.

A father and an electronics businessman from Mukono municipality said he too would enroll his child in free pre-primary if it were available: “Yes, I will enroll because it will be a relief from my financial burden of meeting the expenses of educating my child.… The government should construct government pre-primary schools to help [those of] us who are burdened by the low income yet we want our children to study nursery.”

A Kampala-based grandmother supporting her grandchildren’s pre-primary fees said, “Just like they provide UPE [Universal Primary Education] they should do the same for nursery.… It should be universal nursery education.” A mother in Kampala, who works as a food vendor at a market, struggled to pay for her second child to attend nursery school, but said that if a free pre-primary school had been available, “I would have taken my children to that school.”

Teachers also endorsed universal pre-primary education. A teacher at Palenga Primary School in Omoro district said: “I think the government should attach pre-primary to all UPE schools.” The sentiment was echoed by several other teachers. Medadi Ssentanda, a lecturer at Makerere University in Kampala, who has studied the challenges of literacy acquisition in Uganda, recommends: “The pre-school level should be made compulsory for all Ugandan children. As reading and writing are critical skills to master in the early years of learning and since they determine the progress of a child’s educational life … this should be a priority area for investment in education.”

Educators said that a government decision to make pre-primary education free, or free and compulsory, would also help communicate the importance of early childhood education to parents. For example, a head teacher at a primary school in Omoro district worried that “because it is parents’ decision now … we cannot insist on the child to go to nursery.” But he felt that the government should have a role to “pass on the information to all parents and guardians on the importance of pre-primary,” and “should fund pre-primary which will help parents to know that it is important since the government is putting in money.”

When asked if all children should have the opportunity to attend nursery school, all of the children interviewed responded affirmatively. A 12-year-old boy from Omoro district said: “Every child should first go to nursery. To learn how to write, read, know how to speak English.” A 13-year-old girl who did not attend pre-primary said: “I want them to attend so that by the time they go to Primary One they know how to write names and count numbers. I also wanted to be like that, but they didn’t take me.”



V. Financing for Education

As part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, governments made a commitment at the 2015 World Education Forum in Incheon, Republic of Korea to allocate 4 to 6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) to education and/or to allocate at least 15 to 20 percent of public expenditures to education. The 2021 Paris Declaration on Education Financing reaffirmed these international benchmarks.

In 2004, Uganda spent over 20 percent of its national budget on education. Since then, however, its investments in education have declined significantly. Uganda’s education budget for 2023/24—UGX 4,447 billion—accounted for only 8.4 percent of the total national budget, significantly below the international benchmark of 15 to 20 percent. Its neighbors, Kenya and Tanzania, both allocate more than 18 percent of their national budgets to education. Analysis by ISER-Uganda also shows that total public sector education spending during the National Development Plan II (2015–2020) did not live up to its budget commitment.

In 2022, Uganda spent 2.56 percent of its GDP on government-funded education, below the regional average in sub-Saharan Africa of 3.68 percent, and falling well short of international benchmarks that advise spending 4 to 6 percent of GDP on education. In the 2023/2024 budget, the percentage of GDP devoted to education fell even further, to 1.9 percent.

The World Bank estimates that “a child born in Uganda today will be only 38 percent as productive when she grows up as she could be if she enjoyed complete education and full health.” Increasing Uganda’s investments in education, particularly in pre-primary education, would not only be cost-effective, but would have enormous benefits for children, families, and Ugandan society.

Economic and Social Benefits of Government Funding for Pre-Primary Education

Education investments contribute significantly to economic growth. A 2023 analysis of national income data and over 1,300 nationally representative surveys across 155 countries between 1980 and 2021 found that public expenditure on primary, secondary, and tertiary education accounted for 50 percent of global economic growth, 70 percent of income gains among the world’s poorest 20 percent of individuals, 40 percent of extreme poverty reduction, and over 50 percent of improvement in the share of labor income accruing to women over this period.

Pre-primary education is a particularly powerful investment, paying for itself many times over. A 2023 cost-benefit analysis of pre-primary education in Uganda found that every 1 Ugandan schilling invested in pre-primary education could yield up to UGX 16 in social and economic benefits, including reduced primary school repetition rates, improved lifetime earnings, new employment opportunities, and gains from freeing up the time of primary caregivers. The study concluded that “Investments in early childhood have the greatest rate of return of any human capital intervention.”

Expanding free pre-primary schooling can increase the employment, earnings, and productivity of parents, including by allowing parents—particularly mothers—to enter or re-enter the workforce earlier. A number of studies have found that access to early childhood care and education programs increase mothers’ income and labor force participation, and contribute to gender equality.

Government Savings Through Reduced Repetition and Higher Completion Rates

Investing in universal free pre-primary education can make education systems more effective and efficient, resulting in significant cost savings at primary and secondary education levels. Research from sub-Saharan African countries suggests that investments in early childhood care and education would be offset by up to 87 percent because of higher efficiency within primary education alone.

Uganda’s education data shows that more than half of children who do not attend pre-primary school end up repeating grades, at significant cost to the government. According to UNICEF, excessive repetition can result in 1.2 extra years of education per child and an estimated 5–10 percent of the education budget wasted. A 2017 study estimated that expanding access to pre-primary education in Uganda could reduce Primary 1 repetition rates by 50 percent.

A 2023 cost-benefit analysis estimated that Uganda could save UGX 24.5 billion (US$6.5 million) in repetition costs by 2030 by increasing pre-primary coverage to 90 percent. It also estimated that 90 percent of the costs of scaling up pre-primary education could be covered through savings from reduced repetition rates and underage enrollment in primary school.

The high costs of private pre-primary also prompt many families to enroll their children in primary school before the usual entry age, creating inefficiencies due to over-enrollment in lower grades. Because these children are not adequately prepared for primary school and are less mature than their peers, their early enrollment also results in poor performance, higher repetition rates and unnecessary strain on teachers who manage large classrooms.

In contrast, children who have attended pre-primary education are more likely to enter school on time, less likely to drop out or repeat grades, and more likely to complete primary and secondary school. The provision of at least 1 year of free and compulsory pre-primary education is associated with a 12-percentage point increase in primary school graduation rates in low- and lower-middle-income countries.

Availability of Resources

For most countries, domestic financing (primarily tax revenues) is by far the largest source of education funding. Ninety-three percent of Uganda’s 2023/24 education budget is funded from domestic sources. Most of the remainder is funded by the World Bank, Uganda’s main and most consistent external donor for education.

Even in the lowest-income countries, there are various policy options open to governments to secure resources for education in a progressive manner. These include widening a country’s tax base and stemming tax abuses, improving governance and accountability (including reducing corruption and tax evasion), and re-allocating public expenditures. For example, the Ugandan government could generate additional revenue by curbing illicit financial flows, strengthening compliance among high-net-worth individuals for already existing taxes, curbing tax exemptions and examining the introduction of new taxes. The types of new progressive taxes open to governments to introduce include a wealth tax, taxing large multinationals in the digital economy, applying a financial transactions tax on large bank transactions, and applying a lower threshold for capital gains taxes.

Uganda’s tax-to-GDP ratio as of its 2021-2022 budget stood at 12.3 percent, largely collected through indirect taxes, such as the 18 percent value-added tax (VAT) on goods and services and excise duties. Value-added taxes, which are an indirect tax, tend to be regressive since they are ostensibly the same for people regardless of income, but ultimately burden people with lower incomes more, as they must spend a higher share of their income to buy goods and services subject to VAT.

In Uganda, personal income tax revenue is collected only from individuals in formal employment. Yet nonpayment of such personal income tax is common: In a sample taken in the financial year 2013-2014, only 28 percent of the top lawyers in the country, and only one of 71 high-level government officials, paid personal income tax.

Uganda has one of the lowest corporate income tax collection rates in sub-Saharan Africa, while offering generous corporate tax incentives. In 2021, for example, Uganda lost an estimated UGX 156 billion (US$40.6 million) in revenue due to special tax holidays. UNU WIDER reports that less than 15 percent of businesses in Kampala pay both the national corporate income tax and local trade license fee, resulting in a loss of approximately UGX 10.278 billion (US$2.675 million) in revenue in 2022.

Uganda also loses an estimated US$34 million every year to global tax abuse, including the use of tax havens, by both multinational companies and individuals. The Tax Justice Network estimates that these lost taxes are equivalent to nearly 5 percent of Uganda’s annual education spending.

In 2010, the African Development Bank estimated that tax incentives and exemptions were costing Uganda at least 2 percent of its GDP, the equivalent to about US$272 million. ActionAid estimated that if Uganda eliminated these tax incentives and allocated 20 percent of the savings (US$54.4 million) to education, it could pay for schooling for the 477,000 primary-age children then out of school, for 20,000 additional qualified teachers, and for free school meals for over 470,000 children for one year.

A 2016 report from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggests that tax revenues above 15 percent of GDP are key to reducing inequality. The World Bank has similarly used this 15 percent tax-to-GDP ratio to measure how much more money governments could raise to spend on social services. Some nations with robust social welfare systems may even double these World Bank and IMF benchmarks, such as Denmark, which had a tax-to-GDP ratio of about 41.9 percent in 2022. Among OECD countries, the average tax-to-GDP ratio was about 34 percent in 2022.

The IMF estimates that most countries could realistically raise their tax-to-GDP ratio by five percentage points over the next decade, enabling low-income countries to dramatically increase social spending. ActionAid has calculated that if Uganda increased its tax-to-GDP ratio by 5 percent, it could generate an additional US$3.1 billion in revenue compared to 2017 levels, more than enough to double the 2023 national budgets for education, health, social security, and water, sanitation, and hygiene.

In 2023, the World Bank classified Uganda as a low-income country with a gross national income per capita of $930. At least three other low-income sub-Saharan African countries offer at least one year of free pre-primary education—Madagascar (gross national income per capita of $510), Sierra Leone ($510), and Togo ($990). Sierra Leone, despite having a much lower per capita income than Uganda, devotes 9.1 percent of its GDP to education, more than triple Uganda’s education investment.

Assistance from External Partners

External donors provide a small proportion of Uganda’s education budget. Since 2019/2020, donor funding has ranged from 2 percent to 7 percent of the total education budget. In 2023/24, the World Bank and OPEC contributed 7 percent of the education budget, while other external donors provide “off-budget” support for education projects. For example, in March 2023, Education Cannot Wait announced US$180 million over three years to support the inclusion of refugee children in Uganda’s national education system.

According to the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity, domestic resources should fund the large majority of education costs, but international financing is still critical to reach the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals for education. The commission estimated that with greater efficiencies and expansion of domestic financing, only 3 percent of total education financing will be needed from international sources, but to cover this 3 percent, international financing for education would need to increase to $89 billion per year by 2030.

Over the past 20 years, however, the share of earmarked aid to education has declined. Education accounted for 14.7 percent of total aid in 2003 (not including aid devoted to overall budget support), but only 9.7 percent in 2021. In addition, much of the assistance was provided in the form of scholarships in donor countries rather than assistance to low-income countries that need it the most.

UN member states agreed in 1970 to dedicate 0.7 percent of their gross national income to official development assistance, and have repeatedly reaffirmed this commitment, including in the Sustainable Development Goals. In 2022, only five countries—Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway, and Sweden—met or exceeded this target.





VI. Additional Challenges in Pre-Primary Education

The Ugandan government has the obligation to oversee pre-primary education and ensure its quality, even when it is provided by private actors. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has reminded states that where non-state services play a major role, states parties still “have an obligation to monitor and regulate the quality of provision to ensure that children’s rights are protected and their best interests served.” The Abidjan Principles, adopted in 2019, outline the human rights obligations of states to provide public education and to regulate private involvement in education. These guidelines, which have been recognized by the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights, and which apply to all levels of education including pre-primary, similarly state that states must “establish, maintain, and adequately resource effective monitoring and enforcement mechanisms, to ensure private actors involved in education comply with applicable standards and regulations ... and meet their responsibility to respect the right to education.”

Uganda’s 2008 Education Act requires the government to provide the curriculum, guidelines on minimum standards for school buildings, equipment and other relevant facilities for pre-primary institutions through its relevant agencies; provide the curriculum for teachers’ training for pre-primary teachers and ensure that the teachers who teach in pre-primary institutions have the necessary qualifications; and ensure that all pre-primary schools are licensed, registered and regularly inspected by government education inspectors. Yet, these requirements have not been implemented.

Parents, teachers, and officials interviewed for this report identified a range of concerns regarding pre-primary education, beyond the fees families are required to pay. These include unqualified pre-primary teachers, and government failures to properly regulate pre-primary schools, including licensing, registration, and monitoring.

Unqualified Teachers

Teachers, parents, and education officials all stated that teacher qualifications and the quality of education at pre-primary educational facilities often fell short. Pre-primary teachers are often trained at unaccredited institutions and have lower qualifications than teachers at primary level, who are required to have a Grade III teaching certificate. According to the Ministry of Education and Sports, only half of all pre-primary education teachers have the relevant qualifications, and 18 percent report that they have no training at all.

In its 2020 report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Ugandan government noted that there were “few qualified teachers” in early childhood development. The principal education officer for pre-primary education, Hajat Safina Mutumba, agreed: “The qualification and quality of the personnel recruited to handle the children in pre-primary schools is a challenge.” The district inspector of schools in Omoro district noted that while the majority of primary schools have qualified teachers, “Some of the schools don’t have qualified teachers in nursery ... the majority of the teachers are not that qualified to teach nursery.”

A parent in Kampala said:

Opening of ECDs should not be for everyone. It should be for people who are qualified.… In the medical profession you cannot open a health facility if you don’t have qualifications. But for education, the door is very open. Everybody including the one who sells okra can open the ECD school and after one term it has closed due to poor management largely because the proprietor is not professional.... There must be a policy along that line.

The commissioner for teacher education training and development, Jonathan Kamwana, attributed the prevalence of untrained teaching staff to the fact that they can be paid less: “People want cheap labour. Otherwise, the qualified ones are there but they don’t want to recruit them because there are unqualified ones who are cheap.” Low salaries also drive high turnover among pre-primary teachers, with some sources estimating that half of pre-primary teachers leave the profession every year.

Uganda’s National Development Plan III (2020/21-2024/25) called for training of early childhood development professionals at government teacher training colleges. Commissioner Kamwana said that the government has committed funds for training of pre-primary teachers at government teachers’ colleges, advertised diploma programs for pre-primary teachers, and was trying to register all qualified pre-primary teachers to establish the number of trained teachers.

In November 2023, Uganda’s Cabinet approved the National Teacher Bill to establish a regulatory body for teachers at all levels, including pre-primary. The bill, if approved by Parliament, would create a National Teacher Council, responsible for professionalizing the teaching profession and overseeing and regulating teacher standards. The council will be responsible for registration, licensing, and accreditation of teachers. Minimum qualifications for teachers would require a bachelor’s degree at all levels, including for pre-primary teachers.





Lack of Government Oversight

An estimated 82 percent of early childhood care and education centers in Uganda are not registered, which means they are not certified as meeting the minimum standards set by the government. Fifty-six percent are neither registered nor licensed.

The national Directorate of Education Standards has a mandate to ensure the quality of primary, secondary, and tertiary education, as well as technical schools and polytechnics offering certificates. Pre-primary education, however, does not fall under the directorate’s mandate. The responsibility for registration, licensing, and inspection of pre-primary schools falls to the district local governments, and individual district education officers.

District inspectors say that they have limited capacity to oversee pre-primary schools. The district inspector for schools in Omoro district explained the restraints on his ability to monitor nursery schools: “Finances. According to guidelines, the inspection grants are sent based on the number of schools. So, we prioritize the government schools and also consider a sample of private schools. With the limited budget, you become a bit constrained. If you are supervising 120 schools, you go to all 66 UPE schools and 20 private schools and leave out nursery private schools…. The other challenge, we have few inspectors. We are only two inspectors.”

Joseph Lomongin, the AG district inspector of schools in Nakapiripirit, said that only 7 of the 25 pre-primary schools in his district were licensed. He said: “Nursery goes without inspection. Things have gone digital but the tool for inspection and even the server in the ministry does not include nursery.”

George Karyabuki, the principal inspector of schools and director, Directorate of Education Standards, said: “The major challenge is the fact that the Education Act places pre-primary education in the hands of the private sector and only leaves the government with the role of regulation. This is problematic because the private sector is often profit-driven, as such, market demands often override the standards. The decentralization of early childhood development is also another challenge.”

Karyabuki said that the directorate is designing tools to be used by all local governments to better achieve uniformity in inspection and monitoring. In the meantime, he said, “there is no harmony in the tools designed by each district and local government education officials when it comes to inspection and monitoring of those schools. There is no uniformity of inspectors at this level while executing their mandate.”

Lack of a Standard Curriculum

According to UNESCO, UNICEF, and the Global Partnership for Education, “an appropriate pre-primary curriculum is crucial to achieve the many potential developmental and school readiness benefits of early childhood education.” Uganda’s National Curriculum Development Centre adopted a “learning framework” for early childhood development in 2005, providing guidance on key benchmarks for early childhood education. However, teachers and education officials said that a standard curriculum was not available for pre-primary schools.

A teacher at an infant care center in Mukono district said: “The government should provide a standard syllabus to all nursery schools instead of each school designing its own.” Another teacher in Nakapiripirit district said: “A clear syllabus should be established for nursery with the clear subject matter to be handled at that level of pre-primary.”

Lack of Awareness of the Benefits of Pre-Primary

Finally, some parents are simply unaware that nursery school was an option for their children or do not appreciate its benefits. A primary school teacher in Namalu subcounty of Nakapiripirit said some parents “think that children in pre-primary may not get good care as those in primary.” She said: “There should be enough sensitization of parents especially in rural communities about the benefits of this program such that they too are encouraged. It will be an eye opener for them.”

The district inspector of schools in Omoro district said parents perceive nursery “as wastage of money and they would rather spend on primary as opposed to nursery. Some of them think those children just go to learn how to sing. There is no content.” He added: “The other reason is ignorance. Some of the community is so rural that they don’t value education so much. Those ones will not be able to send a child to school.”

A teacher at a free pre-primary school supported by a Protestant church in Tokora subcounty in Nakapiripirit district, said that even though there were no fees at her school, many parents were still keeping children at home because they “think that the children are still young or underage to go to school.” Another teacher in Nakapiripirit district said: “It can be due to both affordability and attitude of parents.… Before, Karamoja was not into education, it is now that they are waking up.… [Parents] need to be sensitized.” A third teacher said: “Some say it is time-wasting to take the child to school in pre-primary because the three years of pre-primary is too long.”

The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child notes that “knowledge and expertise about early childhood are not static but change over time,” and encourages states parties to undertake systematic child rights training for both children and their parents. It also urges states parties to conduct awareness raising campaigns for the public at large.

The education ministry currently carries out activities such as community dialogues and other awareness raising activities to encourage communities to invest in early childhood education, but more could be done to increase awareness among parents of its value. Ultimately, a decision by the Ugandan government to make pre-primary education free and compulsory and expand its provision to rural areas would send a clear message of the indispensable value of this period of education.





VII. International Law and Standards on Early Childhood Education

The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) declared that everyone has a right to education. This guarantee has been recognized in legally binding international and regional treaties that Uganda has joined, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child.

In implementing their obligations on education, governments should be guided by four essential criteria: availability, accessibility, acceptability, and adaptability. Education should be available throughout the country, including by guaranteeing adequate and quality school infrastructure, and accessible to everyone on an equal basis. Moreover, the form and substance of education should be of acceptable quality and meet minimum educational standards, and the education provided should adapt to the needs of students with diverse social and cultural settings. The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) states that making education accessible entails ensuring that it is accessible to all, especially the most vulnerable groups, in law and fact, without discrimination; that it is physically accessible (i.e. within safe physical reach or via modern technology); and that it is economically accessible, i.e. that everyone can access irrespective of their income.

The Convention on the Rights of the Child recognizes the right of the child to education, and states that the education of the child “shall be directed to: (a) The development of the child’s personality, talents and mental and physical abilities to their fullest potential; (b) The development of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and for the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations; (c) The development of respect for the child’s parents, his or her own cultural identity, language and values, for the national values of the country in which the child is living, the country from which he or she may originate, and for civilizations different from his or her own; and (d) The preparation of the child for responsible life in a free society, in the spirit of understanding, peace, tolerance, equality of sexes, and friendship among all peoples, ethnic, national and religious groups and persons of indigenous origin.”

The Committee on the Rights of the Child—a group of independent experts who monitor countries’ compliance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child—has long addressed pre-primary education within the context of the right to education. In its 2005 General Comment on early childhood, the committee interpreted the right to education “as beginning at birth,” and called on states “to ensure that all young children receive education in the broadest sense.” The committee emphasized the government’s responsibility for early childhood education, saying, “States parties are responsible for service provision for early childhood development. The role of civil society should be complementary to—not a substitute for—the role of the State. Where non-State services play a major role, the Committee reminds States parties that they have an obligation to monitor and regulate the quality of provision to ensure that children’s rights are protected and their best interests served.”

In regards to the cost of pre-primary education, the Committee on the Rights of the Child has recognized “with appreciation” that some states parties were planning to make one year of preschool education available and free of cost for all children,” and underscored that making pre-primary education free is key to its accessibility, especially for lower-income families. In its 2005 review of Uganda’s compliance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the committee specifically recommended that Uganda “increase public expenditure on education, in particular pre-primary, primary and secondary education.”

An overarching principle of the Convention on the Rights of the Child is that “in all actions concerning children … the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.” Designing an education system that establishes parents’ ability or willingness to pay fees as a threshold barrier for whether a child can access pre-primary or secondary school is hard to reconcile with this principle, as it prioritizes the parent’s economic situation or valuation of education before any consideration of the child’s best interests and rights.

The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, like the Convention on the Rights of the Child, states that “every child shall have the right to education.” It also similarly states that the education of the child “shall be directed to: (a) the promotion and development of the child’s personality, talents and mental and physical abilities to their fullest potential; (b) fostering respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms with particular reference to those set out in the provisions of various African instruments on human and peoples’ rights and international human rights declarations and convention; (c) the preservation and strengthening of positive African morals, traditional values and cultures; (d) the preparation of the child for responsible life in a free society, in the spirit of understanding, tolerance, dialogue, mutual respect and friendship among all peoples ethnic, tribal and religious groups; (e) the preservation of national independence and territorial integrity; (f) the promotion and achievements of African Unity and Solidarity; (g) the development of respect for the environment and natural resources; (",HIGH,20240613T033000Z,Parents and Guardians,"James Muhindo (not his real name), Hajat Safina Mutumba (Principal Education Officer)",Government of Uganda,"Kawempe, Kampala; Tokora, Nakapiripirit; Mukono; Omoro district; Namayingo district","Government to establish free public pre-primary education, regulatory measures for private institutions.",Inaccessibility and affordability of pre-primary education,Uganda,"Poverty, reliance on private education, lack of government funding"

Niger’s highest court on June 14 may decide to lift the immunity from prosecution of former President Mohamed Bazoum following proceedings that failed to meet basic due process standards. The Nigerien authorities should drop this problematic case and respect Bazoum’s fair trial rights.

Bazoum has been arbitrarily detained in the presidential residence since last July, when Nigerien army officers overthrew his government in a military coup. In August, the junta authorities announced plans to prosecute him for “high treason” and undermining national security, but never brought him before a judge. In April, the authorities initiated legal proceedings against him to lift his presidential immunity so he could be prosecuted for alleged crimes committed after he was elected president in 2021.

Following the coup, the junta created the State Court to replace the Court of Cassation and the Council of State, making it the highest court in Niger. The proceedings before the State Court have been marred by serious irregularities, including violations of Bazoum’s rights to present evidence in his defense, to communicate with his legal counsel, and to be heard before an independent court. By bringing the case before the country’s highest court, they also denied Bazoum his right to appeal the ruling.

Nigerien human rights advocates have questioned the court’s proceedings. One lawyer said: “How can a court whose president is named directly by the head of state be an impartial and independent body?”

Bazoum’s lawyers told Human Rights Watch that they have been unable to communicate with him since last October and have had restricted access to case material. “Authorities amended article 141 of the court statute [concerning access to case information], while the case was already pending before the court, hindering us from consulting key documents in the file,” said Moussa Coulibaly, one of Bazoum’s lawyers. “You can’t change the rules during the match.”

In September, Bazoum filed a petition with the Community Court of Justice of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), citing violations of human rights against him and his family during his detention. In December, the ECOWAS court ruled that Bazoum was arbitrarily detained and called for his release.

The African Union Principles on the Right to a Fair Trial provide that the essential elements of a fair hearing in all legal proceedings include: access to legal counsel, adequate opportunity to prepare a case, and the right to an appeal to a higher judicial body.

(Bangkok) – The Thai government should immediately release Y Quynh Bdap, a Montagnard religious freedom activist and refugee, and ensure that he is not sent back to Vietnam, Human Rights Watch said today. If returned, he faces a real risk of an unfair trial and ill-treatment by Vietnamese authorities.

On June 11, 2024, Thai Immigration police in Bangkok arrested Y Quynh Bdap, 32, the co-founder of Montagnards Stand for Justice, on immigration charges. He is currently detained at the Bangkok Remand Prison pending an extradition trial. The Vietnamese government requested Thai authorities extradite Y Quynh Bdap, who has been living in Thailand since 2018 and had refugee status determined by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Vietnamese authorities are seeking Y Quynh Bdap on terrorism charges related to deadly riots in Dak Lak province in Vietnam’s central highland region in June 2023, for which he was sentenced in absentia to 10 years in prison in January. Human Rights Watch has no information on Y Quynh Bdap’s possible involvement in the riots, but is gravely concerned about his safety and his receiving a fair trial in Vietnam.

“Returning the Vietnamese activist Y Quynh Bdap to Vietnam would place him in grave danger,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Thai authorities should recognize Y Quynh Bdap’s refugee status, release him, and ensure he’s not put in harm’s way.”

Montagnards Stand for Justice has sought to protect and promote the rights to freedom of religion and other rights of Montagnards in Vietnam’s central highlands. The Vietnamese government has long persecuted Christian Montagnards belonging to independent house churches, supporters of nonviolent demands for independence or autonomy, and people objecting to the transfer of land and forests traditionally used by highlanders to Vietnamese businesses and settlers.

On June 12, the United Nations special rapporteur on human rights defenders, Mary Lawlor, expressed concerns about Y Quynh Bdap’s arrest and said that extraditing him to Vietnam would mean that Thailand was “not fit to be elected” to the UN Human Rights Council later this year.

Human Rights Watch’s recent report, “‘We Thought We Were Safe’: Repression and Refoulement of Refugees in Thailand,” documents a pattern of transnational repression in which Thai authorities helped neighboring governments take unlawful actions against refugees and dissidents seeking shelter in Thailand. In exchange, Thai authorities were able to target critics of the Thai government living in Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia as part of a “swap mart” of refugees and dissidents. In May 2019, three Thai dissidents—Chucheep Chivasut, Siam Theerawut, and Kritsana Thapthai—were forcibly disappeared after Vietnamese authorities arrested them.

Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin should break with the abusive practice of previous Thai governments and ensure that Y Quynh Bdap is not returned to Vietnam in violation of international and Thai law, Human Rights Watch said.

Thailand is obligated to respect the international law principle of nonrefoulement, which prohibits countries from returning anyone to a place where they would face a real risk of persecution, torture, or other serious ill-treatment, or a threat to life. This principle is explicitly codified in the United Nations Convention against Torture, to which Thailand is a party, and customary international law.

In addition, Thailand’s Act on Prevention and Suppression of Torture and Enforced Disappearances, which came into effect in February 2023, states that “no government organizations or public officials shall expel, deport, or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of torture, cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, or enforced disappearance.”

“The Thai government shouldn’t do Hanoi’s bidding by forcibly returning Y Quynh Bdap to Vietnam,” Pearson said. “Thailand needs to meet its obligations to protect refugees and demonstrate it deserves a seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council.”",HIGH,20240614T020000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Y Quynh Bdap, Elaine Pearson, Mary Lawlor","Thai government, Vietnamese authorities","Bangkok, Thailand","Release Y Quynh Bdap, ensure adherence to international law regarding refugees",Unlawful detention and potential refoulement of a refugee,Thailand,"Persecution of Montagnards in Vietnam, Thai government practices of extraditing refugees"

We direct our advocacy towards governments, armed groups and businesses, pushing them to change or enforce their laws, policies and practices. And we work globally to champion meaningful and fair justice for victims and survivors of atrocity crimes, before national and international courts.

My statement today is presented on behalf of Human Rights Watch, together with The Advocates for Human Rights; Center for Justice and Accountability; Civil Society Human Rights Advocacy Platform of Liberia (CSO Platform); CIVITAS MAXIMA; Coalition for the Establishment of a War and Economic Crimes Court in Liberia; Global Justice and Research Project; Global Justice Center; and the Secretariat for the Establishment of War Crimes Court in Liberia. This group represents American, Liberian, and international organizations all working together to bring justice to Liberian citizens.

Together our groups have been advocating for the establishment of a Liberian-led war crimes court in Liberia to address the legacy of impunity for the widespread and systematic violations of international human rights and humanitarian law[1] that characterized the country’s two brutal armed conflicts, which took place between 1989 and 2003. Liberian men, women, and children were gunned down in their homes, marketplaces, and places of worship. In a few cases hundreds of civilians[2] were massacred in a matter of hours. Girls and women were subjected to horrific sexual violence[3] including gang-rape, sexual slavery, and torture. Children were abducted from their homes and schools and pressed into service, often after witnessing the murder of their parents. The violence blighted the lives of tens of thousands of civilians and displaced almost half the population.

While there have been a number of important criminal and civil cases outside of Liberia—and these cases have contributed to momentum within the country for justice[4]—to date not a single person has faced criminal investigation or prosecution in Liberia for serious crimes committed during the civil wars. In its 2009 final report, the Liberian Truth and Reconciliation Commission recommended the creation of an extraordinary criminal court[5] which would be a hybrid court composed of Liberian and international judges, prosecutors and other staff with a mandate to try those allegedly responsible for committing serious crimes. A legislative conference to talk about accountability was organized in Monrovia in 2019 with the legislature of Liberia, a Liberian coalition of NGOs, and international partners.[6]

There is now renewed momentum after nearly two decades for the establishment of a court. Most recently, in March and April of 2024, the Liberian Senate and House of Representatives passed a resolution supporting the creation of a war and economic crimes court. On May 2, 2024, President Joseph Boakai signed an executive order[7] establishing an Office of the War and Economic Crimes Court for Liberia.

The US government has played a critical role in advancing progress. US Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice Beth Van Schaack has repeatedly voiced the US government’s partnership with Liberia in its journey to justice. Her commitments on behalf of the US government to support this process have been widely welcomed within Liberia. Members of Congress have also expressed their support for this court and justice for the Liberian people.[8]

These developments are promising, and yet there is much work ahead that will need the support of the United States and others in the international community. Making Liberian-led justice a reality in Liberia requires sustained attention from justice champions in and outside of Liberia.

What is needed now is for President Boakai’s administration to translate its stated commitment to a war crimes court into concrete steps for the court’s creation.

We have made the following recommendations to the government of Liberia:

Establish the Office proposed by President Boakai to be responsible for developing and implementing a concrete plan to establish a war and economic crimes court to hold perpetrators of grave crimes committed during Liberia’s armed conflicts to account, consistent with international standards and practice and ensure this plan is consistent with a victim-centered approach, including consultation with affected communities on the design of the court;

Establish an independent committee comprised of government officials, a member of the Independent National Commission of Human Rights, international legal experts, and Liberian and international civil society actors from various sectors that is mandated to advise the government on the court’s creation. The committee should help establish a roadmap on the way forward for ensuring justice for war crimes and for strengthening the rule of law;

Request assistance from the United Nations, African Union, Economic Community of West African States, and other international and regional partners as needed;

Ensure a war crimes court for Liberia includes key elements in order to achieve trials that would be fair, meaningful, and credible: Composition of judicial benches that will have sufficient independence and expertise by including a majority of international judges on each trial and appeals bench; No bars on prosecution of individuals on the basis of their cooperation with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission; Inclusion of crimes and modes of liability in line with international standards; Fair trial protections; Witness protection and support; Involvement of victims of abuses in proceedings; and Outreach and communications that inform the victims and public.

Work with the legislature to ensure the war crimes court established to hold perpetrators of grave crimes committed during Liberia’s armed conflicts to account is consistent with international standards and practice;

Request from international partners adequate support and funding, for programs designed to improve Liberia’s judiciary and criminal justice system, to ensure an effective war crimes court and victims’ access to justice and the right of the accused to a fair trial;

Continue to support efforts by third countries to bring universal jurisdiction cases for civil war-era crimes, including by continuing to fully cooperate with foreign authorities who request authorization to come to Liberia to investigate international crimes;

Develop and implement a comprehensive reparations scheme for all victims of gross human rights violations and war crimes;

Ensure protection for human rights defenders inside Liberia against attacks and intimidation, and bring to justice those who intimidate or attack human rights defenders.

The process and the work of the court itself must be Liberian-led. This means primarily that Liberians who were impacted by the civil wars and have long advocated for accountability have a leading voice in determining the court’s trajectory. Liberian experts should also fill key positions in the judiciary, prosecution, defense, and registry. Liberian ownership of the court is crucial to build and maintain local support for accountability processes. Ensuring the court benefits from Liberian experts will also ensure that investing in the court strengthens the domestic justice system, leading to long-term benefits across Liberian institutions. The first step towards ensuring that the court is Liberian-led is making sure that Liberians and regional experts play critical roles in the creation of the court.

Liberian civil society has been advocating for accountability in Liberia at great personal risk. Powerful actors opposed to accountability for wartime atrocities and former warlords hold positions of power in Liberia, and international actors have also at times worked to undermine their efforts. As a result, members of civil society have received threats to their security and their work over the years. These threats continue to this day. It is imperative that international partners, including the United States government, continue to support Liberian civil society organizations and the crucial work they are doing to see accountability in Liberia for civil war-era atrocities.

High-level messages from Liberia’s international and regional partners in support of a court are also needed to maintain positive momentum. Liberia should request international and regional support to help it to determine the best legal and structural modalities for the court’s creation in a manner that will enable fair, credible functioning and partners should pledge international support and expertise based on accumulated experience.

We recommend that the US Congress:

Make clear its support to a Liberian-led process to achieve justice in the country through the creation of a credible war crimes court, and support to Liberian civil society organizations engaged in this effort;

Provide the requested support to the Liberian government and civil society organizations working on behalf of justice, including assistance in developing the necessary legislation and systems for the protection of victims and witnesses, support in the legal representation of victims, and processes to engage meaningfully with the public and victims and survivors to create awareness of the objectives of a war crimes court and to allow Liberian voices to inform the design of the court;

Offer financial support for the court, as the US has done in several other contexts, including, for example, the annual contributions to the Special Criminal Court in the Central African Republic.",HIGH,20240613T223000Z,"The Advocates for Human Rights, Center for Justice and Accountability, Civil Society Human Rights Advocacy Platform of Liberia, CIVITAS MAXIMA, Coalition for the Establishment of a War and Economic Crimes Court in Liberia, Global Justice and Research Project, Global Justice Center, Human Rights Watch, Secretariat for the Establishment of War Crimes Court in Liberia","President Joseph Boakai, US Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice Beth Van Schaack",Perpetrators of war crimes during Liberia's civil wars,Liberia,"Establish a war crimes court, ensure Liberian leadership in its creation, protect human rights defenders, and support civil society engagement",Widespread and systematic violations of international human rights and humanitarian law during two brutal armed conflicts from 1989 to 2003,Liberia,Widespread violence and lack of accountability for serious crimes during civil wars

(Abuja) – African governments should accelerate plans to guarantee free quality education from preschool through secondary education before 2030, Human Rights Watch said today on the African Union (AU)’s Day of the African Child, June 16, 2024.

Africa is the region with the world’s highest out-of-school population. In 2021, 98 million children and older adolescents of primary and secondary school age were out of school. The majority of pre-primary-age children are unable to access early childhood education. Although significant progress has been made across the continent to close gender gaps, more girls are out of school than boys and many drop out before completing primary or secondary education.

“Millions of African children are still waiting to get an education, while millions more are in school but not receiving the quality education their governments have pledged to provide,” said Mausi Segun, Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “Dozens of African states have adopted educational standards that contradict their human rights obligations, compromising the quality of education available to African children.”

The 2024 theme for the Day of the African Child is: “Education for All Children in Africa: The Time is Now.” With deadlines to reach global and African education commitments fast approaching, African governments should focus on guaranteeing access to quality free education and remove legal, policy, and practice barriers that continue to deny an education to millions of children, especially girls, Human Rights Watch said.

All African governments have adopted commitments to guarantee 12 years of primary and secondary education for all children and to provide at least one year of free pre-primary education. Deadlines set by states to fulfill these goals are fast approaching, including the AU’s Continental Education Strategy, which sets out member states’ objectives to be met by 2025, and the Sustainable Development Goals, which should be reached by 2030. The AU set 2024 as its Year of Education to renew collective commitment and joint action by African countries toward these goals and its longer-term development agenda.

Some African states have taken important steps towards guaranteeing these rights. In 2022, Zambia implemented a free education policy from early childhood to secondary education in all public schools, while Madagascar adopted a bill to provide for one year of free and compulsory pre-primary education. In 2023, Sierra Leone adopted a new education law, guaranteeing children a full 13 years of free education, including one year of pre-primary as well as secondary education.

Financial barriers and the lack of free education have a disproportionate impact on children from the poorest households, who are often at higher risk of dropping out. All governments should adopt stronger measures to advance free education and to end the practice of charging students extra-official tuition and enrollment fees, charges for school materials, as well as unaffordable payments for school uniforms and tackle other indirect costs such as school transportation.

African governments’ commitments to guarantee at least one year of pre-primary education have not been implemented consistently, Human Rights Watch research shows. In Uganda, which adopted free primary education in 1997 and free secondary education in 2007, free pre-primary education is not available. Human Rights Watch and the Initiative for Social and Economic Rights Uganda found that very high fees for children ages 3 to 5 in private pre-primary schools exacerbate inequality in learning and create an insurmountable barrier for most families, particularly those in rural areas and those with little income.

African governments should adopt legal and policy frameworks to guarantee the right to early childhood education and ensure that lower and higher secondary education is free and available to all children across Africa, Human Rights Watch said. They should particularly focus on ensuring that universal access to primary and secondary education is underpinned by fully free education.

African governments will not fulfill their obligations until they have eliminated the biggest barriers and ended human rights abuses faced by girls. Thousands of girls permanently drop out of school or are forced out by teachers and school officials because they are pregnant or are parents, and many are unable to continue schooling due to child marriage. Eighteen of the 20 countries with the world’s highest child marriage rates are in sub-Saharan Africa. Most have very high rates of teenage pregnancy and high percentages of girls out of secondary school.

Governments’ failures to tackle and prevent school-related sexual violence and end impunity for sexual offenses is a serious obstacle for many girls. In many countries, students, overwhelmingly girls, face high levels of sexual and gender-based violence, including sexual exploitation, harassment, and abuse by teachers, other school officials, and students.

In Kenya, Tanzania, Sierra Leone, and Senegal, some teachers and school officials, as well as many motorcycle and bus drivers, sexually exploit and coerce girls in exchange for money for tuition fees, menstrual pads, and other basic items. In Senegal, in some contexts, the low retention rate of girls is closely linked to fear that girls will be exposed to sexual harassment and gender-based violence in school or that girls will be at high risk of pregnancy because of the school environment.

Across the continent, progress has been made in advancing the right to education of girls who are pregnant or parenting. Thirty-eight countries have adopted policies related to the education of students who are pregnant or parenting. Yet, even with these policies, some countries adhere to measures that effectively hinder girls’ right to education, including the denial or limitations on comprehensive sexuality education and inaction on widespread school-related sexual violence.

More than 10 countries also adhere to punitive policies or lack frameworks that acknowledge adolescent pregnancy in schools. At least 5 also make sexual behavior outside of marriage a criminal offense.

African governments should urgently review their policies and adopt human rights-compliant measures for students who are pregnant or parenting that fully reflect their commitments to advancing girls’ right to education. Governments should also comprehensively respond to the broader needs of girls who are parenting, including with social protection measures that provide adequate financial support and guarantee access to child care and early childhood education.

Governments should focus more resources on preventing adolescent pregnancies by promoting and guaranteeing adolescents’ sexual and reproductive rights, including access to comprehensive, non-judgmental sexuality education and information.

“The African Union and states’ common vision for Africa’s future through education is clear,” Segun said. “African governments should urgently follow through on their commitments to guarantee fully free, quality education in line with their human rights obligations by 2030.”",HIGH,20240615T234500Z,Human Rights Watch,Mausi Segun,African governments,Africa,"Accelerate commitments to guarantee free quality education for all children, particularly girls.","Failure to guarantee free, quality education for all children, especially girls",Mozambique,"Financial barriers, gender discrimination, cultural practices such as child marriage"

Despite commitments by government institutions, sexual violence remains endemic in Ecuador’s schools and finding justice is elusive for many survivors.

Over the last decade, 6,438 cases of sexual violence by teachers, school authorities, other school staff, janitors, and other students have been reported, affecting 7,303 children.

The government should allocate adequate resources for its prevention efforts and ensure that judicial institutions effectively investigate and prosecute all cases of school-related sexual violence.

(New York) – The Ecuadorian government’s measures to respond to sexual violence in schools have not progressed at the scale and pace needed to ensure that all children are safe, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. Despite commitments and measures by government institutions, sexual violence remains endemic in Ecuador’s schools and finding justice is often elusive for survivors.

The 60-page report, “‘Like Patchwork’: Ecuador’s Slow Progress Tackling and Preventing School-Related Sexual Violence,” documents significant gaps in the government’s response to prevent and tackle abuses in Ecuador’s education system. Many schools still fail to report abuses or fully implement required protocols. Judicial institutions do not adequately investigate or prosecute sexual offenses against children, affecting survivors’ ability to find justice.

“Against a backdrop of insecurity, hundreds of children experience school-related sexual violence in Ecuador’s schools,” said Katherine La Puente, children’s rights coordinator at Human Rights Watch. “Ecuador’s response and prevention measures are not commensurate with the scale and urgent need to carry out its zero-tolerance commitment against school-related sexual violence.”

Human Rights Watch conducted 68 interviews with representatives of civil society organizations, lawyers, activists, experts, children’s rights defenders, and government officials in Ecuador. Human Rights Watch also reviewed and analyzed data on reported cases, investigations, and prosecutions of sexual violence provided by the Ministry of Education, the Attorney General’s Office, and the Judiciary Council.

Sexual and gender-based violence is a longstanding, pervasive problem in Ecuador’s schools. Over the last decade, 6,438 cases of sexual violence by teachers, school authorities, other school staff, janitors, and other students have been reported, affecting 7,303 children. In the last four years alone, between January 2020 and June 2024, Education Ministry data shows 2,827 cases. From January 2014 to June 2024, supplemental data provided by the Ministry shows bus drivers were reported abusers in 78 cases, raising the total number to 6,516. Barriers to reporting and a focus on protecting schools’ reputations over a child’s best interests lead to significant underreporting.

Increased levels of insecurity and violence in recent years, along with remote learning in response to pandemic or emergency-related school closures, have hampered government institutions’ ability to detect and respond to cases of sexual violence. Ecuadorian children’s rights groups and UN experts have sounded the alarm on the impact that the recent levels of violence have on children and their rights.

In June 2020, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled against Ecuador in Paola Guzmán Albarracín v. Ecuador, the court’s first case on school-related sexual violence. The Court ordered the government to take specific steps to prevent, address, and eradicate sexual violence in schools. These measures include improving detection and reporting of cases; training education staff regarding treatment and prevention; information, assistance and attention to victims and their families; and regularly updated statistical information.

Since 2020, Ecuador has taken significant steps to tackle sexual violence in schools and to expedite justice for survivors. The Public Policy to Eradicate Sexual Violence in Schools, which includes anticipated actions through 2030, coordinates the government’s approach for prevention, response, generation of information, and survivors’ access to justice and reparations.

In October 2023, the Education Ministry issued a National Strategy on Comprehensive Sexuality Education, also through 2030, requiring its application in all schools across the country. The government has also engaged in other inter-ministerial efforts to eradicate sexual violence in schools. Even with these important steps, there remain significant gaps in the government’s response and its compliance with the Inter-American Court’s orders, Human Rights Watch said.

Despite protocols requiring school staff to report cases of sexual violence, many cases go unreported. Human Rights Watch found that staff do not always know about or follow through with the Education Ministry’s binding protocols; that they may prioritize school prestige and reputation over the need to protect students, reduce abuse, and hold abusers accountable; and that there is a significant shortage of student welfare teams, including school psychologists and counselors. Budget cuts to initiatives for responding to school-based sexual violence have likely hampered their impact.

While the Ecuadorian government has made important advances in the roll-out of its strategy and curriculum, education authorities have often faced pushback and resistance on methodologies and tools developed to teach CSE. Some teachers and parents have objected to learning the material and teaching subjects, such as adolescent pregnancy prevention. Teachers and schools sometimes neglect topics such as gender, sexual orientation, and gender identity in school discussions, even though these are key concepts to understand sexual and reproductive health and to prevent sexual violence.

Human Rights Watch also found serious concerns about Ecuador’s judicial system, including limited expertise in dealing with cases of sexual and gender-based violence against adolescents and other children, a shortage of prosecutors countrywide, and limited availability of experts, such as psychologists, doctors, and sign language interpreters. Significant delays in judicial proceedings often mean that survivors wait years for cases to be concluded.

These concerns are compounded by the effects of a 2021 Constitutional Court ruling that found a teacher’s dismissal for sexual harassment of a student was disproportionate to his offense. Following the ruling, courts have reinstated at least 23 teachers whom the Education Ministry had found responsible for sexual violence.

The Ecuadorian government should adequately fund its prevention efforts and ensure that institutions are able to hire and fill in gaps in essential educational and prosecutorial staff, Human Rights Watch said. The government should ensure that judicial institutions effectively investigate and prosecute all cases of school-related sexual violence.

“The Ecuadorian government should reaffirm its commitment to decisively address sexual violence in schools,” La Puente said. “To effectively eradicate sexual violence in schools, Ecuador needs to end impunity and complicit behaviors that subject thousands of children to abuses and undermine children’s right to be safe in school.”",HIGH,20240724T054500Z,Human Rights Watch,Katherine La Puente,Ecuadorian government and educational institutions,Schools in Ecuador,"Adequate funding for prevention, effective investigation and prosecution of cases",Inadequate response to sexual violence in schools,Ecuador,"Stigma around reporting, prioritization of school reputation, shortage of welfare teams"

(Washington, DC) – Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s appearance before a joint session of Congress on July 24, 2024, highlights the continued and significant US supply of weapons to Israel’s military despite credible allegations of ongoing war crimes by Israeli forces in Gaza, Human Rights Watch said today.

“US officials are well aware of the mounting evidence that Israeli forces have committed war crimes in Gaza, including most likely with US weapons,” said Tirana Hassan, executive director at Human Rights Watch. “US lawmakers should be seriously concerned about the liability risks of continuing to provide arms and intelligence based on Israel’s flimsy assurances that it’s abiding by the laws of war.”

In 2023, the Biden administration introduced a revised conventional arms export policy that adjusted its approach, reducing “the level of certainty required to deny an arms transfer” from “actual knowledge to a more likely than not determination that the arms will be used to commit, facilitate the commission of, or aggravate the risk of international law violations.” Domestic laws also require a risk assessment before providing security assistance and establish red lines for when assistance is not allowed.

Yet the Biden administration reported to Congress in May that Israeli forces were complying with US domestic policies and laws on arms transfers. In March, Human Rights Watch and Oxfam warned that the Israeli government’s assurances to the Biden administration that it is meeting US legal requirements were not credible. The two organizations jointly submitted a dossier to the State Department showing Israeli forces’ violations of international humanitarian law, including blocking humanitarian assistance and carrying out unlawful strikes that killed civilians.

Israeli forces have unlawfully attacked residential buildings, medical facilities, and aid workers, restricted medical evacuations, and used starvation as a weapon of war in the Gaza Strip, where nearly 500,000 people are experiencing a “catastrophic” lack of food in famine-like conditions. A staggering more than 38,600 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

Israeli authorities have detained and mistreated thousands of Palestinians, with persistent reports of torture. In the occupied West Bank, where Israeli forces have killed over 500 Palestinians since October 7, settlers and soldiers have displaced entire Palestinian communities, destroying every home, with the apparent backing of higher Israeli authorities and effectively confiscating Palestinians’ lands.

Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and dozens of media reports, including by CNN, NPR, the New York Times, and AFP, have identified US weapons being used in unlawful Israeli attacks that killed scores of civilians and aid workers.

In May, President Biden announced that the US would pause at least one shipment of weapons containing 2,000-pound bombs, 500-pound bombs, and artillery projectiles to Israel. In July, the administration clarified that it was only holding back the 2,000-pound bombs and that it would be releasing the 500-pound bombs to Israel. It said that its “concern” was about “the end-use of the 2,000-lb bombs, particularly for Israel’s Rafah campaign, which they have announced they are concluding.”

In recent years, legal scholars and US lawmakers warned that US support – including through weapons sales – to Saudi Arabia’s military campaign in Yemen could expose US officials to legal liability for war crimes.

In 2016, according to media reports, State Department officials reviewing weapons sales to Saudi Arabia expressed concerns that jurisprudence from international tribunals could offer precedent for their own liability. In an unsent draft letter to the secretary of state, a State Department lawyer concluded that US officials could potentially be charged with war crimes for the Saudi-led coalition’s conduct in Yemen.

In 2020, when discussing the risk presented by continued arms sales to Saudi Arabia, Oona Hathaway, a Yale Law School professor and a Defense Department lawyer in the Obama administration, told the New York Times, “If I were in the State Department, I would be freaking out about my potential for liability. I think anyone who’s involved in this program should get themselves a lawyer. It’s very dangerous territory the US is in, continuing to provide support given the number of civilians who have been killed.”

In 2022, US Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Mike Lee sent letters to the Defense and State Departments, calling for “thorough investigations into possible US complicity to civilian harm in Yemen.”

A state assisting another state or a nonstate armed group may be complicit in war crimes and other wrongdoing if their assistance knowingly and significantly contributes to the wrongful act. Individuals can be found complicit for “aiding and abetting” in war crimes under international law.

The United States and other weapons suppliers should suspend military assistance and arms sales to Israel, Human Rights Watch said. The Biden administration should use its leverage with Israel to save lives, including by military aid and the imposition of targeted sanctions, to press Israeli authorities to enable the provision of humanitarian aid and basic services, and cease committing grave abuses in Gaza.",VERY HIGH,20240723T054500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Benjamin Netanyahu, Joe Biden, Tirana Hassan",Israeli forces,"Gaza Strip, occupied West Bank","Suspend military assistance and arms sales to Israel, press for humanitarian aid",War crimes in Gaza,Israel,"Israeli military actions against Palestinians, arms sales from US to Israel"

(New York) – The Bangladeshi government has deployed the army against student protesters, imposed shoot-on-sight curfew orders, and shut down mobile data and internet services, Human Rights Watch said today. These actions followed violent protests against excesses by security forces to quell a peaceful student protest campaign.

With more than 160 people killed, foreign governments should immediately call on Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her administration to end the use of excessive force against protesters and hold troops to account for human rights abuses.

“Bangladesh has been troubled for a long time due to unfettered security force abuses against anyone who opposes the Sheikh Hasina government, and we are witnessing that same playbook again, this time to attack unarmed student protesters,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Now is the time for influential governments to press Sheikh Hasina to stop her forces from brutalizing students and other protesters.”

In early July 2024, tens of thousands of university students began peacefully protesting after a High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh ruling restoring quotas in government jobs for various categories of people, particularly the 30 percent for descendants of those who had joined the war for independence of Bangladesh in 1971. Students contended that the quota for war veterans would unfairly benefit government supporters. On July 15, members of the Chhatra League (BCL), the student group affiliated with Prime Minister Hasina’s Awami League Party, backed by police, attacked the protesters, killing six people.

Protests spread to several cities and universities across the country following the July 15 attack, leading to deadly clashes between protesters and the pro-government supporters and security forces, with hundreds killed or wounded. Security forces have used live ammunition, tear gas, stun grenades, rubber bullets, and shotgun pellets to disperse protesters. With the internet shut down, reliable information is difficult to get; Agence France-Presse said that police and hospitals had reported 163 deaths, but activists fear the number is much higher. “I have never seen such cruelty,” a Dhaka resident who recently left the country told Human Rights Watch. “The security forces just kept on shooting. They were shooting at such young people. They even shot at bystanders if they tried to help protect the students.”

Several journalists were injured when assaulted by security forces and Chhatra League supporters. The United Nations human rights chief, Volker Türk, called for restraint and said the “attacks on student protesters are particularly shocking and unacceptable.”

Prime Minister Hasina, who won a fourth consecutive term after January elections that were not free or fair, had previously imposed and then withdrawn the quota. She has called for dialogue and promised an inquiry into the July 15 deaths. Educational institutions have been closed indefinitely. On July 21, the Supreme Court, hearing an appeal from the government, ruled to reduce the quota in government jobs, allocating 5 percent for descendants of independence war veterans and 2 percent for other categories.

However, students said that Sheikh Hasina has lost their trust following a statement that denounced the protesters as political traitors. The students responded by calling her an “autocrat.”

On June 18, the Bangladeshi authorities imposed a nationwide internet shutdown, critically limiting communications, access to information, and ability to share reports of human rights abuses.

The junior telecommunications minister, Zunaid Ahmed Palak, confirmed the shutdown, citing concerns over the spread of “fake news.” Bangladeshi media sites were unable to upload credible information, fueling dangerous rumours. “Bangladesh is in information darkness,” one activist told Human Rights Watch.

The UN Human Rights Council had said in a 2016 consensus resolution that shutting the internet to intentionally prevent or disrupt access to or dissemination of information online violates international human rights law, and that all countries should refrain from and cease such measures.

Protests continued on July 19 and 20, with several people killed by security forces. After protesters stormed a jail in Narsingdi district and set fire to the state broadcaster’s offices, the government issued curfew orders and deployed the military.

On July 22, a student leader declared a 48-hour halt to the protests, calling on the government to end the curfew, restore access to the internet, and stop targeting the student protesters.

The authorities have arrested hundreds of protest participants and organizers, and there are allegations of enforced disappearances and torture in custody. Reports trickling out of Bangladesh say that there is ongoing violence in several places where protesters, now joined by members of the political opposition, are clashing with members of the Chhatra League and security forces. Police have backed the Chhatra League attacks instead of arresting those who engaged in violence.

In a television interview, the information minister, Mohammad A. Arafat, reportedly said that the civil unrest could be quelled quickly, but the government was exercising restraint. “The government hasn’t even used five percent of its total capability in this,” he said. “If it does, it won’t take half an hour. But the government is showing patience to avoid casualties.”

The UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms prohibit the use of firearms except in cases of imminent threat of death or serious injury. The UN Human Rights Committee, which monitors compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, has stated that “firearms are not an appropriate tool for the policing of assemblies, and must never be used simply to disperse an assembly.… [A]ny use of firearms by law enforcement officials in the context of assemblies must be limited to targeted individuals in circumstances in which it is strictly necessary to confront an imminent threat of death or serious injury.”

The 2020 UN guidance on “less-lethal weapons” in law enforcement says: “Multiple projectiles fired at the same time are inaccurate and, in general, their use cannot comply with the principles of necessity and proportionality. Metal pellets, such as those fired from shotguns, should never be used.”

The authorities repeatedly deny that Bangladeshi security forces have committed serious human rights violations including extrajudicial killings, torture, and enforced disappearances, leading to a climate of impunity, Human Rights Watch said. Other governments, including the United Kingdom and the European Union, should place Bangladeshi security forces under increased scrutiny following the designation of human rights sanctions by the US government.

“Bangladeshi authorities have flouted international standards in the past and continue to do so during the ongoing protests,” Ganguly said. “The Sheikh Hasina government should take immediate steps to end the crisis, rein in and punish security forces and her party supporters who have committed serious crimes, and protect the rights of protesting students.”",VERY HIGH,20240723T044500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Meenakshi Ganguly (Human Rights Watch), Volker Türk (UN human rights chief)",Bangladeshi government and security forces,"Dhaka, Bangladesh and other cities","End excessive force, hold troops accountable, restore internet access, protect protesters' rights",Excessive force against student protesters and human rights abuses,Bangladesh,"Restoration of job quotas for government posts, government opposition to student protests"

(Jerusalem) – Israeli forces have been publishing degrading photographs and videos of detained Palestinians, including children, a form of inhumane treatment and an outrage on their personal dignity that amount to war crimes, Human Rights Watch said today.

In many cases, detainees were stripped of their clothing, sometimes fully, then photographed or filmed, with the images published by Israeli soldiers, media outlets, or activists. Forced nudity followed by capturing and sharing sexualized images on social media is a form of sexual violence and also a war crime.

“Israeli authorities have for months turned a blind eye as members of their military published dehumanizing fully or seminude images and videos of Palestinians in their custody,” said Balkees Jarrah, acting Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. “Senior officials and military commanders can be held criminally responsible for ordering these crimes, or for failing to prevent or punish them, including at the International Criminal Court.”

Israeli military officials have publicly denounced some of their members for publishing images of the detainees, but as far as Human Rights Watch has been able to determine, the government has not publicly condemned the underlying treatment of Palestinian detainees depicted in the images. Judicial authorities have not announced any prosecutions for these crimes. On July 15, Human Rights Watch wrote to the Public Diplomacy Office of the Israeli military but has not received a response.

Since October, Israeli forces have reportedly detained thousands of Palestinians from Gaza at Sde Teiman, an army base in southern Israel, where they have been reportedly ill-treated and tortured, and where at least 36 died in custody, according to media reports. As of July, 124 Palestinians remained at Sde Teiman, according to the Times of Israel, despite the Israeli attorney general calling on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to transfer detainees out of the facility due to the reports of abuse and deaths in custody.

Human Rights Watch analyzed 37 of the posts depicting captured Palestinians, predominantly men and boys in Gaza and the West Bank, often stripped to their underwear and in some cases completely naked, handcuffed, blindfolded, and injured. Some posts included demeaning and humiliating captions by Israeli soldiers or journalists. Platforms like TikTok and YouTube have removed some of these posts.

Between October 25 and December 28, one Israeli soldier, who according to his social media holds United States citizenship, published at least seven photos and videos of Palestinian men detained by his unit in the West Bank. In the images, the clothed detainees are handcuffed, many of them are blindfolded, and some have Israeli flags placed on them.

In two videos, published on October 28 and 29, the soldier places US dollar bills on the knees of two handcuffed, blindfolded, and squatting men, as a “blessing” while he mocks them and asks them to repeat phrases in Hebrew. The soldier also posted degrading captions, such as “trolling Hamas,” to accompany some of the published images.

In another case, an Israeli soldier in Gaza published a photo on Facebook on December 8, showing at least 22 detained males in a single file, all stripped to their underwear, some of them blindfolded. At least two detainees appear to be children. The caption says: “As part of our mission we kept Hamas terrorists under arrest. We'll settle for this picture, there are pictures not for publication …”

Another image posted on Instagram, by an Israeli soldier, who according to media reports holds US citizenship, shows what appears to be a photograph of himself standing in front of at least six men with their backs to the camera, stripped to their underwear and kneeling on the ground while handcuffed and blindfolded, with their arms above their head. The caption of the now deleted photo says: “Mom I think I freed palestine” [sic].

Two separate investigations by the BBC on the conduct of Israeli soldiers, in February in Gaza, and in May in the West Bank, found that Israeli soldiers uploaded to social media platforms dozens of images and videos intended to humiliate Palestinians, including images of detainees who had been stripped to their underwear and others who had been draped in Israeli flags.

The Israeli military told the BBC that it had terminated the service of one reservist and that this conduct did not represent its values. In a response to another BBC investigation, the Israeli military said it had instructed soldiers “to avoid uploading footage of operational activities to social media networks,” and while it did not condemn any specific acts, it said that soldiers were “disciplined and even suspended from reserve duty” in the event of “unacceptable behavior.” The military spokesperson, Daniel Hagari, and national security advisor, Tzachi Hanegbi, separately commented in December that people who surrendered or were arrested needed to be stripped to be searched, as they could be carrying explosives or weapons, but that clothes should be returned to them and any photos taken should not be distributed. Hagari said the photos were “unusual” and that disciplinary measures will be taken in any event that is inconsistent with the Israeli military’s values. Hangebi said the photos “served no purpose.” The Israeli military gave no further details on holding those responsible accountable.

In its May 2024 report, the United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel concluded that the forced public stripping, nudity, and related “specific persecutory acts” against Palestinian men and boys in Israeli custody were either ordered or condoned by Israeli authorities, given the frequency of these abuses, the way these acts were filmed and photographed, and that they occurred in several locations.

Sexual violence and committing “outrages upon personal dignity” on detainees are serious violations of international humanitarian law, or the laws of war, applicable to all parties to the hostilities in Israel and Palestine.

On October 7, Hamas-led Palestinian armed groups, in what amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, attacked southern Israel, killing 815 civilians, according to Agence France-Presse, and taking 251 people hostage. Since then, Israeli forces have unlawfully attacked residential buildings, medical facilities, and aid workers, largely destroying Gaza’s civilian infrastructure, including its water and electricity plants. Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza, where about 90 percent of the population have been displaced, many of them repeatedly.

Gaza’s Health Ministry has reported over 38,000 deaths and 88,000 injuries. These abuses occur amid the ongoing Israeli crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution against Palestinians.

Common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions requires that everyone in the custody of a warring party “shall in all circumstances be treated humanely.” Prohibited acts include “outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment.” Violations of article 3 are war crimes.

The International Criminal Court (ICC), in its Elements of Crimes explanation of the Rome Statute crimes, defines “outrages upon personal dignity” as acts in which “[t]he perpetrator humiliated, degraded or otherwise violated the dignity of one or more persons [and] the severity of the humiliation, degradation or other violation was of such degree as to be generally recognized as an outrage upon personal dignity.”

On May 20, the ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, announced that he was seeking arrest warrants against two senior Israeli officials and three Hamas leaders. Khan confirmed that his office has been conducting an investigation since March 2021 into atrocity crimes committed in Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and that since 2014, his office has jurisdiction over crimes in the current hostilities between Israel and Palestinian armed groups that covers unlawful conduct by all parties.

“International law recognizes the inherent dignity of human beings caught in a conflict, no matter what side they are on,” Jarrah said. “Victims have a right to justice and accountability, and any evidence of sexual violence should be investigated urgently in a way that is thorough, credible, and prioritizes the needs, well-being, and wishes of the survivors.”",HIGH,20240723T044500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Balkees Jarrah, Israeli military officials",Israeli Forces,"Sde Teiman army base, southern Israel, and various locations in Gaza and the West Bank","Urgent investigation and accountability for abuses, protection of detainee rights","Degrading treatment and sexual violence against detained Palestinians, including children",Israel,Ongoing conflict and military actions between Israel and Palestinian armed groups

(Nyon) – The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has failed to investigate or provide access to remedy for Indian wrestlers protesting sexual harassment and violence for more than a year, the Sport & Rights Alliance said in a report released today.

The report, ‘“We Were Only Demanding Justice”: Sexual Abuse in Indian Wrestling Federation’, details the pattern of sexual harassment and violence suffered by athletes during the 12-year tenure of then-President of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI), Brij Bhushan Singh, who was also a Parliament member with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the time.

Guided by athletes with lived experience of abuse in sports, in the Athletes Network for Safer Sports, the Sport & Rights Alliance’s new report details the pattern of harassment and violence including unwanted touching, soliciting sexual acts from and committing sexual assault against women and girl athletes at national and international junior and women’s competitions, and other abuses.

In an interview with the Sport & Rights Alliance, two-time Olympian and Paris 2024 contender Vinesh Phogat said, “Who will listen? If such great athletes did not get justice or if they struggled so much to be heard, imagine: How can a normal person feel safe?”

In interviews for the report, athletes who experienced abuse under Singh told the Sport & Rights Alliance they had no safe way to report the abuse or seek help at the time. When the abusers are powerful sports officials who are well-connected with national governments, an athlete’s decision to speak up may lead to retaliation, or even the end of their career. The IOC does have a hotline for reporting athlete abuse and other issues, established in 2015, but it is not widely publicized, neglects trauma-informed best practices, and is only available in English, among other problems.

“For athletes facing abuse, a hotline is a lifeline,” said Joanna Maranhão, network coordinator at the Sport & Rights Alliance. “However, the current IOC hotline is not fit for purpose. It lacks the most important element of a trauma-informed approach: someone who actively listens. Making the choice to seek help is already a struggle. It is essential that the paths to justice and healing are clear and efficient.”

In January 2023, Phogat and fellow Olympians Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia began public protests against Singh’s abuses and the federation’s inaction. Over 30 Indian wrestlers, both men and women, and hundreds of supporters joined the protests, including at a sit-in near the parliament building in India’s capital, New Delhi.

“I was probably 17-18 years old at that time,” said Malik, India’s first medalist in Olympic women’s wrestling. “I was very young and did not have the courage to raise my voice at that time. If I raised my voice in the junior and cadet championships, it would have ended it ... So that's why we sat silently.”

The IOC should overhaul the existing abuse hotline for Olympic athletes, to establish an effective resource for abuse survivors to safely report physical, sexual, or emotional abuse; when national bodies are unwilling or unable to effectively respond, and especially when there is a conflict of interest, the Sport & Rights Alliance said. The hotline needs to be legitimate, rights-compatible, trauma-informed, and aligned with best reporting practices.

“Athletes deserve a hotline that prioritizes their wellbeing,” said Dr. Payoshni Mitra, executive director at Humans of Sport and main researcher for the report. “The current IOC reporting channel fails to accommodate best practices for grievance mechanisms – and even sometimes refers the athlete back to their national association, which can contribute to further abuse and retaliation.”

In April 2024, Singh was ordered to face a criminal trial; yet even if he is convicted, India’s top wrestlers will still be far from justice, safe working conditions, and reparations, the Sport & Rights Alliance said. During their months-long protests demanding protection and Singh’s accountability, the wrestlers were subjected to harassment, threats, arrest, and detention in retaliation for their demands.

“India’s incredible wrestlers have put their careers on the line to end the pattern of impunity and abuse in their sport,” said Minky Worden, director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch. “If India wants to host the 2036 Olympic and Paralympic Games, the Indian authorities should take these reports seriously and implement urgent safeguarding reforms.”

An investigation into Singh’s alleged abuses, ordered in January 2023 by India’s Department of Sports, Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports, has still not been made public or available to the wrestlers. After months of protests by the athletes demanding that Singh step down, WFI called for presidential elections. On December 21, 2023, Brij Bhushan Singh’s loyalist and aide Sanjay Singh was elected as new WFI chief. Sanjay Singh actually celebrated his election at Brij Bhushan Singh’s house with posters that read “We dominate, our domination will continue.” The IOC, WFI, and United World Wrestling were contacted by the Sport & Rights Alliance on July 16, but they have not responded to requests for comment. Brij Bhushan Singh did not immediately respond to a July 22 request for comment.

“The succession of someone so closely connected to the alleged abuser is a clear sign that systemic reform has not taken place,” said Andrea Florence, director of the Sport & Rights Alliance. “There must be an extensive, transparent investigation into the full scope of Singh’s abuse and the culture, systems, and processes that enabled it for over 10 years.”

In addition to replacing its hotline, the IOC should ensure a comprehensive, independent, and trauma-informed investigation into the reports of harassment, abuse, threats and retaliation by those linked to the WFI. In collaboration with United World Wrestling, the IOC should also fully investigate the Wrestling Federation of India regarding their adherence to safeguarding and good governance standards, and make their findings public. A full list of recommendations to the IOC, Indian government, and other sports bodies is included in the report.

Please see below for quotes from some of the wrestlers’ testimonies in the report.

Quotes from the Report

“Indian society normalizes abuse and harassment. They will only take it seriously when the assault is gruesome. But it is like how we fight a wrestling bout. Whether we lose by one point or by ten, we lose. Whether the assault is big or small, it is an assault. An act against our will.”

- Vinesh Phogat, two-time Olympian and Paris 2024 contender

“I had told one of my seniors and also my parents when I was harassed by him early in my career. My parents felt speaking up will end my career and advised me against complaining. I wish I knew about any independent body where one could complain at the time when this happened. It is so important to make sure that athletes feel safe to report harassment.”

- Sakshi Malik, Bronze medalist at 2016 Rio Olympics

“I thought he wanted to congratulate me … Due to the continuous inappropriate acts by [Singh], I was so traumatized and mentally upset that it was difficult for me to focus and deliver to the best of my ability at various competitions.”

- 20-year-old victim

“His only intention was to touch me inappropriately … “While we were sitting he [Singh] was touching his leg against mine and continued talking and even touched my knees … he [groped me] on the pretext of checking my breathing … He told me I would be allowed to continue my career in sports only if I came and met the accused [Singh] in person.”

- 21-year-old victim

“We never left our rooms alone … “I refused [to see him separately] since the accused [Singh] was touching other girls also inappropriately.” When Singh approached the 19-year-old again, “he pulled up my t-shirt and slid his hand down my stomach and put his hand on my navel with the pretext of checking my breath … “I was called into the office of the federation … where I met [Singh] who told me that the federation is willing to bear the expenses for my treatment provided if I give in to his sexual advances.”

- 19-year-old victim

“My body froze out of shock … [Singh] came near me and suddenly, to my shock and surprise, leaned in on me and … pulled up my t-shirt and [groped me] on the pretext of … checking my breathing.”

- 20-year-old victim

On July 18, South Korea’s Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling affirming that the country’s National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) must extend dependent benefits to same-sex partners.

The plaintiff in the case, So Sung-uk, was registered by his partner, Kim Yong-min, as a dependent to obtain employer health insurance benefits. The NHIS accepted So as a dependent, but later revoked that status when it was publicly reported that the NHIS had recognized a same-sex couple.

The Seoul High Court ruled in the couple’s favor in 2023, but the NHIS appealed that decision to the Supreme Court.

Human Rights Watch submitted an amicus brief to the Supreme Court in advance of their decision, arguing that the exclusion of same-sex couples was discriminatory and violated international human rights law. The brief detailed international and regional precedents highlighting a state’s responsibility to recognize and protect same-sex relationships, the lack of such protections in South Korea, and the growing recognition of same-sex relationships in Asia and the Pacific Islands.

In its decision, the Supreme Court affirmed the High Court’s ruling and said that excluding same-sex couples from dependent benefits violated their right to equality as well as their privacy, dignity, and right to pursue happiness.

While the case specifically involved health insurance benefits, the decision provides significant support for same-sex couples seeking access to other state benefits that are currently extended to heterosexual couples who are married or recognized as de facto married, but continue to be withheld from same-sex couples.

South Korea’s lawmakers now have an opportunity to embrace the logic and values of the decision by acting to address the discriminatory treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in the country. By enacting comprehensive antidiscrimination legislation and creating a framework to recognize and protect same-sex partnerships, lawmakers would be making significant strides in ensuring that LGBT people can more fully participate in social and economic life without discrimination.",HIGH,20240723T193000Z,Human Rights Watch,"So Sung-uk, Kim Yong-min",National Health Insurance Service (NHIS),"Supreme Court, Seoul, South Korea","Enact comprehensive antidiscrimination legislation, recognize same-sex partnerships",Exclusion of same-sex couples from dependent benefits is discriminatory and violates international human rights law,South Korea,"Discrimination against LGBT individuals, lack of recognition of same-sex relationships in South Korea"

(Bogota) - Governments in Latin America, the United States, and Europe should spare no diplomatic efforts to protect the right to vote of Venezuelans ahead of the presidential election scheduled for July 28, 2024, Human Rights Watch said today. They should enhance their scrutiny of Venezuela before, during, and in the weeks following election day.

Arrests of opposition members, arbitrary disqualifications of opposition candidates, and efforts to further restrict civic space have severely marred the electoral process in Venezuela. The elections are taking place in a context ofyears of systematic human rights abuses by the government and a severe humanitarian crisis that has forced roughly eight million people to leave the country.

“While the election in Venezuela will hardly be free or fair, Venezuelans have their best chance in over a decade to elect their government, and the international community should have their back as they do,” said Juanita Goebertus, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. “The United States, Brazil, Colombia, and the European Union should use all the diplomatic tools at their disposal to protect Venezuelans’ right to vote.”

On October 17, 2023, the Venezuelan opposition and the government signed the Barbados Agreement, in which they agreed to honor political parties’ right to choose their presidential candidates and to hold the presidential election in the second half of 2024, among other electoral protections. The US agreed to temporarily lift certain sanctions in exchange for a commitment to hold free and fair elections.

The US also released Alex Saab, a Colombian businessman with close ties to the Nicolás Maduro’s government in Venezuela who had been indicted for money laundering. However, as the Maduro government did not fully satisfy its commitments under the agreement, in January and April 2024 the US re-established some of those sanctions.

The electoral process has been marred by human rights violations and irregularities that have kept the playing field uneven. The Supreme Court has imposed leaders who support the government on opposition parties, undermining the parties’ autonomy. In late June 2023, the Comptroller General’s Office announced that María Corina Machado, the leader of the opposition, was barred from running. In October 2023, she won a primary election organized by the opposition, with more than 90 percent of the vote. However, in January 2024, the Supreme Court upheld the decision to bar her, as well as Henrique Capriles, another opposition leader.

Machado then proposed professor Corina Yoris to run in her place, but the electoral authority did not allow her to register her candidacy. In March 2024, the electoral authority allowed Edmundo González, a former diplomat, to register as the opposition Unitary Platform nominee for president.

The government has repeatedly committed systematic human rights violations against critics and opposition leaders, Human Rights Watch said.

The pro bono legal group Foro Penal reported that 114 people have been arrested in politically motivated cases in 2024, 102 are linked to Machado and González, and 77 of these arrests occurred after the beginning of the political campaign on July 4. Those arrested include 27 people who worked or volunteered for Machado’s party, Vente Venezuela. Six other people have sought refuge in the Argentine embassy in Caracas, after authorities threatened to arrest them.

While González and Machado, who supports him, have for the most part been allowed to campaign, Venezuelan authorities have harassed people perceived as supporting them, including by reportedly closing or fining restaurants or hotels used by Machado and detaining people who provided logistical services such as sound equipment for her rallies.

On July 17, Maduro, who has been in power since 2013 and is running for re-election, said there would be a “bloodbath” in Venezuela if he lost.

Only a handful of international observers with limited capacity will be present during the elections. The Carter Center, one of them, said it “will not conduct a comprehensive assessment of the voting, counting, and tabulation processes.” The UN will send an Electoral Technical Team, which will not issue public statements but will produce a confidential report.

In May, the National Electoral Council withdrew an invitation to the EU to observe the elections, a move that contradicted the Barbados Agreement. On July 17, in response to an invitation from the opposition, a group of European Parliament members agreed to send an accompanying electoral delegation to be present during the election day.

Foreign governments should follow the election closely and publicly condemn any additional steps to undermine the right to vote, including further arbitrary arrests and disqualifications, improper changes to ballots, and arbitrary government intervention in the functioning of opposition political parties.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres should remain attentive to the electoral process in Venezuela and be prepared to take further action based on reports from the Electoral Technical Team.

On July 22, President Luíz Inacio Lula da Silva in Brazil urged Maduro to recognize the election results. “I am frightened by Maduro’s statement that if he loses the elections, there will be a bloodbath,” Lula said in a media interview. “Maduro needs to learn that when you win, you stay; and when you lose, you leave—and prepare for the next election.”

The governments of Presidents Gustavo Petro in Colombia and Lula in Brazil should use their access to the Venezuelan government to press for an end to the persecution of opposition leaders and supporters, to protect all voters’ ability to vote, and make sure all votes are properly counted, Human Rights Watch said. They should encourage Venezuela’s government to prevent violence and promote a fully rights-respecting electoral process.

The administration of US President Joe Biden should continue to use its leverage, including conditioned targeted sanctions, to promote respect for people’s vote on election day and during the following weeks.

The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Karim Khan, is conducting an investigation into crimes against humanity in Venezuela. The prosecutor should remind Venezuelan authorities that renewed repression that amounts to crimes within the court’s jurisdiction could be subject to his investigation. The ICC is a court of last resort, stepping in only when national authorities are genuinely unwilling or unable to do so.

“Venezuelans have a narrow, but real, opportunity to make their voices heard,” Goebertus said. “The international community has a key role to play in pressing for Venezuelan voters’ rights to be protected, and their votes counted.”",HIGH,20240725T183000Z,Human Rights Watch,"María Corina Machado, Edmundo González, Nicolás Maduro, Juanita Goebertus",Venezuelan government,Venezuela,"International community to stay vigilant, support Venezuelans' right to vote, ensure fair electoral processes.",Systematic human rights violations and electoral irregularities,Venezuela,"Systematic abuses by the Maduro government, humanitarian crisis"

Imagine you’re the leader of your country… Would you meet with a leader from another country responsible for atrocities and wanted for war crimes?

This question has emerged twice in recent days, in separate top-level meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has key responsibility for ongoing Russian atrocities in Ukraine and is personally wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for war crimes.

Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán met with Putin last week. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi is meeting Putin today and tomorrow.

Orbán’s face-to-face with the Russian president in Moscow on Friday brought a wave of condemnation from Hungary’s EU partners and fellow members of the ICC. This included a highly unusual statement from the head of EU foreign affairs, emphasizing it was purely a bilateral meeting between Hungary and Russia, not related to Hungary currently holding the EU’s rotating presidency.

Still, as my colleague, Iskra Kirova, noted, the meeting risked “being an affront to victims of grave abuses in Ukraine.”

Putin’s meeting with India’s Modi now brings up the same concern, with an additional angle for everyone in India with a sense of history. Writing for the Indian news outlet Scroll, HRW’s Meenakshi Ganguly and Rachel Denber reminded Modi:

“Russia’s tactics mirror those of colonial armies, something that the prime minister of a country that bore the brunt of colonialism should speak up against.”

Leaders have various strategies to try to confront the bad optics of meeting with people linked to atrocities. Both Orbán and Modi have already met with Putin since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, usually couching it in terms of peace efforts or claims they are mentioning Russia’s abuses privately.

Victims of Russian atrocities in Ukraine will hardly find such “silent diplomacy” encouraging, given its lack of results on the ground, where atrocities continue.

This brings us back to the general question – should you meet with such abusive leaders? – and perhaps also to a general answer.

What these meetings achieve for the abusive dictators is obvious: a photo op that helps them claim everything is normal, that they are not a pariah and fugitive from justice. Look, if these people are meeting with me, I can’t be as terrible as my enemies claim, right?

But what do such meetings achieve for the people getting slaughtered and tortured? The question, then, is not really whether to have a meeting or not, but what your aim in having the meeting is and what issues you will raise.

(Brussels) – The EU and its member states should safeguard the right to territorial asylum in Europe, Human Rights Watch and more than 94 other organizations said in a statement released today. The recent and increasing attempts by several European Union member states to outsource asylum processing and refugee protection to countries outside the EU – such as in the Italy-Albania agreement on migration – contravene their legal responsibilities toward people in need of protection.

“All EU member states are obliged to ensure the right to asylum under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights,” said Iskra Kirova, Europe and Central Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. “Neither the Charter nor the recently adopted EU Pact on Migration and Asylum provides any option for countries to transfer asylum seekers for processing to countries outside of the EU.”

The European Commission should firmly reject calls to facilitate shifting asylum processing outside EU territory, the groups said. Wherever such externalization schemes have been attempted, they have been rife with rights violations. They may place asylum seekers in prolonged detention in countries that lack capacity to fairly and fully examine claims and provide protection, leaving them in limbo and denying them crucial legal safeguards, while costing taxpayers inordinate sums.

Proposals to externalize asylum processing come against the backdrop of increased efforts by the European Commission to reach controversial deals and provide hefty migration cooperation funds to neighbouring countries to keep migrants outside of Europe, with little or no attention to much needed human rights safeguards, the groups said.

“Instead of wasting further time and resources on proposals incompatible with EU law and human rights commitments, the EU should support humane, sustainable, and realistic reception and asylum processing policies in EU territory,” said Kirova. “Such policies would benefit both the people seeking protection and the communities that welcome them.”",HIGH,20240709T013000Z,Human Rights Watch and other organizations,Iskra Kirova,European Union member states,"Shenjin, northwestern Albania","Support humane, sustainable, and realistic asylum processing policies in EU territory.",Outsourcing asylum processing and refugee protection to countries outside the EU,Albania,Increased anti-migration sentiment and policies

Iranian authorities have used excessive and lethal force against predominantly Kurds crossing the border from Iraq with goods for resale.

High rates of unemployment and poverty are among the drivers for people to work as border couriers, known as Kulbars, legally or illegally, which is a physically demanding and dangerous work.

Iranian authorities should develop sustainable economic opportunities in border regions to reduce dependency on border courier work for these communities to economically survive.

(Beirut) – Iranian authorities have used excessive and lethal force against predominantly Kurdish border couriers, known in Kurdish and Farsi as Kulbars, transporting goods between Iran and Iraq over rugged terrain, Human Rights Watch said today. The couriers have limited access to justice or remedy for these violations, and Iranian authorities have mistreated those they have detained.

Iranian authorities have long repressed and marginalized Kurdish communities. High rates of unemployment and poverty are among the main drivers for people to work as border couriers, legally or illegally, which is a physically demanding and dangerous work even beyond the additional dangers posed by Iranian security forces. United for Iran, a human rights group, said that the border couriers are mostly men and boys ages 13 to 65. But that they include some women. Iranian authorities have claimed that they have used force to stop smuggling but have also said they want to regulate the border couriers’ economic activities more broadly rather than violently repress it.

“Iranian security forces’ excessive use of lethal force against Kurdish border couriers is one more way that authorities repress socially and economically marginalized Kurdish communities,” said Nahid Naghshbandi, acting Iran researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Iranian authorities should develop sustainable economic opportunities in border regions to reduce dependency on border courier work for these communities to economically survive.”

Between October 2021 and April 2024, Human Rights Watch interviewed 13 Kurdish border couriers who were survivors of and/or witnesses to Iranian security forces’ use of excessive and lethal force or relatives of victims. Witnesses said that Iran’s FARAJA Border Guard force and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) were among the units that targeted the border couriers with lethal force.

Incidents documented occurred along Iran-Iraq border areas in the Iranian provinces of Kermanshah and West Azerbaijan. All 13 people were Kurdish, interviews were conducted remotely in Kurdish and Farsi, and interviewees described incidents that occurred between 2014 and 2023.

Six people interviewed said that Iranian security forces aimed at them and shot them, and that they had seen others shot. Two said that Iranian security forces shot and killed their relatives who worked as border couriers. One lost a leg after stepping on a landmine. Human Rights Watch reviewed medical records and court documents of six survivors of landmine and gunshot injuries, including two people who lost limbs after landmine explosions. Three said that Iranian security forces detained and beat them while shouting insults.

Ebrahim Raeesi, the recently deceased president, suggested in meetings with Kurdish communities that authorities should regulate Kurdish border couriers work rather than deeming it illegal. Since 2020, there have been plans in the government and parliament on regulatory measures for border couriers’ work, support for border communities’ socioeconomic needs, and calls to limit the use of lethal force against Kulbars.

Yet, officials in Iran’s security forces have framed this activity as a security issue. On December 16, 2018, Espadana Khabar News Agency, quoting General Qasem Rezaei, the commander of Iran’s border guards, saying that “borders are defined by law; any unauthorized crossing of the border is considered a crime....”

According to a July 8 report by the Centre for Supporters of Human Rights (CSHR), a nongovernmental organization established in the United Kingdom dedicated to advocating for sustainable peace and democracy in Iran and the broader Middle East by promoting human rights, many border couriers are involved in legitimate cross-border trade and not engaged in unlawful activities.

In June 2023, a member of the Iranian parliament’s National Security Commission announced the completion of a review of pending legislation, with proposed amendments that not only broaden the range of authorities authorized to use firearms but also the conditions under which they can do so. If passed into law, the amendments would put the couriers at even greater risk.

Instead of enabling even more lethal force against Kurdish border couriers, Iranian authorities should restrict the blatant use of lethal force against them, ensure their due process rights, and hold the forces who unlawfully attack them accountable for these violations Nahid Naghshbandi Acting Iran Researcher, Human Rights Watch

Iranian authorities’ use of lethal force against those crossing the border has led to deadly consequences for hundreds of these workers. The Kurdistan Press Agency, known as Kurdpa, reported that at least 44 were killed and 463 injured between March 21, 2023, and March 21, 2024. According to the report, military forces were responsible for over 80 percent of these casualties, and that at least 28 of the casualties were children. In a separate report, Kurdpa provided statistics indicating that from 2011 to 2024, at least 2,463 couriers have been killed and injured from the Iranian Kurdish regions of Kurdistan, Kermanshah, and Western Azerbaijan.

Access to remedy and justice for the border couriers remains severely limited, exacerbating their social and economic marginalization. Despite the frequent and often fatal assaults they face, legal recourse is minimal and accountability for state agents is rare. Iran’s legal system prioritizes national security over individual rights, leaving the victims with little protection under the law. Efforts to seek justice are often thwarted by systemic biases, lack of transparency, and the broad discretionary powers granted to security forces.

The UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials states that law enforcement officials shall not use firearms except in self-defense or defense of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury, to prevent a particularly serious crime involving grave threat to life, to arrest a person presenting such a danger and resisting their authority, or to prevent their escape, and only when less extreme means are insufficient. In any event, intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable to protect life.

The United Nations Fact-Finding Mission, as well as the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran, should monitor and report on the treatment of Kurdish border couriers in Iran.

“Instead of enabling even more lethal force against Kurdish border couriers, Iranian authorities should restrict the blatant use of lethal force against them, ensure their due process rights, and hold the forces who unlawfully attack them accountable for these violations,” Naghshbandi said.

Border Couriers in Kurdish Regions

Border couriers, who are often Kurdish, transport goods between Iran and Iraq by bypassing customs, typically earning payment based on the weight and type of goods they carry. The Kurdish word Kulbar, is derived from “Kul” meaning back and “bar” meaning carrier. They often carry loads weighing between 25 to 50 kilograms (55 to 110 pounds), sometimes heavier, along mountainous routes averaging around 10 kilometers, with some routes stretching longer distances. A small number also carry their loads on horses and mules. Payment varies depending on factors such as load weight, route, and economic conditions.

The border couriers typically transport consumer goods legally available for sale. This includes a range of items such as tea, packaged foods, electronics, textiles, footwear, clothing, kitchenware, health and beauty products, tires, mobile phones, and occasionally cigarettes. Border couriers told Human Rights Watch that alcoholic beverages are generally avoided because there are prohibitions on transporting alcohol and alcoholic consumption, which can result in significant fines or imprisonment.

Kurdish border couriers told Human Rights Watch that Iranian security forces frequently shot at or assaulted them without warning, even when they were not carrying any goods. A 31-year-old man from Sardasht in Western Azerbaijan province said that in July 2018, security forces began shooting at him and fellow couriers from a distance of 10 meters (32.8 feet) without warning. The security forces shot him in the spine, leaving him paralyzed.

A 33-year-old man from the region Hawraman, which is located in both Kurdistan and Kermanshah provinces, said he witnessed a border courier in front of him being shot and tried to help move him to a hospital.

“In fall 2023, about 2,000 couriers were gathered when security forces suddenly attacked,” he said. “They fired shots into the air, hoping we’d flee, but many held onto our goods. When they saw this, they began shooting into the crowd. With no way to run, they accused us of smuggling weapons, which was untrue. Someone lower down in the mountains was shot in the leg. We tried to help him, but security forces initially blocked us.”

Many border couriers are also killed and injured by landmines, many of them remnants from the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. However, some said they believed some of the mines were placed recently as explosions occurred along routes they had previously used and believed to be safe.

A 33-year-old man from Piranshahr in Western Azerbaijan province said that he lost his leg from a landmine explosion when he was 30. He said that many of his family members also were border couriers. Security forces had also shot his brother and killed his cousin.

Provinces with large Kurdish communities like Kermanshah and Kurdistan were among the top 10 provinces with the highest unemployment rates last year, as reported by AsrIran news website, and many border couriers come from these areas. Eleven border couriers said that they turned to this work as a last resort because they could not find any other employment opportunities and needed to support their families. Four men said that they started working as border couriers as young as age 11.

A 36-year-old man from Sardasht, in Western Azerbaijan province, said that when he was 8, his father stepped on a landmine and died while working as a border courier. The son started doing the same work at age 11 to help cover family expenses.

Some people said they took up this work because other available jobs offer unsustainably low wages. A 33-year-old man from Hawraman said that despite having a bachelor’s degree, he could not get a stable government job. The private-sector jobs he found paid so poorly that he could barely afford his rent. He started working as a border courier to cover his rent and provide for himself and his wife.

Security Forces’ Use of Lethal Force

Twelve people interviewed described incidents in which Iranian security forces had opened fire on couriers, usually without warning. Two described killings of their relatives. One said that his brother-in-law, 30, was fatally shot in October 2022. The man, who had a 10-year-old child, was the second husband of the interviewee’s sister, whose first husband had also died while working as a border courier a decade earlier. He said:

My brother-in-law and his friends, who all faced unemployment, went to Iraqi Kurdistan to bring goods for sale in Iran. However, Iranian border closures left them stranded in Kurdistan Region of Iraq for almost 10 days. Upon their attempt to return, Iranian forces shot my brother-in-law in the mountains around 1 a.m. … When we received the body … the doctor said that he had been hit by a Kalashnikov bullet, piercing his left leg and causing severe bleeding.

A 33-year-old man said that in fall 2023, he was shot by security forces in his back, injuring his spine, while he was carrying cosmetics and hygiene products. He said he faced serious mental health issues after the shooting, including attempting suicide three times. A month earlier, security forces had shot him with birdshot pellets in his back, which he said resulted in infection.

Iranian security forces shot a 40-year-old man from Oshnavieh, West Azerbaijan province in February 2017, blinding him. He said:

It was the first and last time I worked as a Kulbar. I decided to go out of necessity that time. It was evening when we saw people coming down from the border… Little did I know they were border guards who had come on foot… As I realized they were soldiers, my head was facing towards them, and they were shooting bullets toward me. One bullet hit me directly on my head, hitting my left eye, and then it hit my right eye, causing me to lose both of my eyes.

A 36-year-old man from Sardasht was shot in the back in January 2014, resulting in a spinal cord injury and permanent disability. He said he was carrying goods with his mules when the security forces began shooting. His mules were killed, and he witnessed the mules of another man accompanying him killed by security forces and then set on fire.

A 25-year-old man said that when he was 16 or 17, security forces shot him on the borders of Nowsud, in Kermanshah province.



The Iranian border police always shoot at us. I’ve been shot in the knee multiple times, and now I have three bullets lodged in the tendon of my right knee that affect my balance. The first time I faced a shooting, I was just 16 or 17 years old. Initially, fear paralyzed me: it’s a strange feeling when you see someone aiming directly at you…. During my escape, I tumbled from a five-meter-high rock and ended up breaking my knee.

A 41-year-old man from Oshnavieh in Western Azerbaijan province said that in February 2017, security forces shot him in the head, leaving him blind in both eyes. A 32-year-old man from Sardasht said that in December 2013, security forces ambushed him and his fellow border couriers, resulting in severe injuries to him and the loss of eight horses:

The [Iranian security forces] fired as if they were on a battlefield, a bullet struck me in the stomach. I fell from my horse, and they approached me, beat and insulted me as I bled, despite my pleas. One of them aimed a gun at my head, just like a close-up execution. Miraculously, I survived. After [I was] taken to multiple hospitals, doctors said I wouldn’t make it. I spent nearly a year in a coma, losing my eyesight and undergoing stomach surgery due to the bullet tearing my large intestine in five places.

Lethal Threat of Landmines

Many border couriers suffer severe injuries from landmines, including loss of limbs. While many landmines were laid during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war, some border couriers believe that Iranian security forces have laid mines more recently along their routes. Iran is not among the 164 countries that have ratified the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, which comprehensively prohibits antipersonnel landmines and requires mine clearance, stockpile destruction, and victim assistance.

A 33-year-old man from Piranshahr lost his leg due to a landmine in November 2020. He said:

I had been through the route that I took many times before as a Kulbar, and I knew it well. Even just three nights before, I was there, and there were no mines. There had never been any mines there previously. But on the day, we went, there were mines there. This indicates that just one or two nights before, they had planted mines there, knowing that it was the route used by Kulbars. We’ve traveled these routes so many times, we know where the old mines are and we go through places we’re sure of, but they plant new mines.

In 2022, a local Iranian lawyers’ office requested in a letter to the West Azerbaijan province governor to remedy the landmine issue, stating:

The frequent and indiscriminate victimization of citizens due to landmines underscores the extensive and insecure nature of the mine-affected areas. There is a pressing need for extensive and continuous communication with the Ministry of Defense and the Mine Clearance Command… Additionally, the use of landmines in some border areas, where the transit of Kulbars is expected, requires the governorate to seriously address the issue with relevant authorities.

Injuries often lead to lost livelihoods. Without social or unemployment benefits in Iran, the injured border couriers’ only hope is to be recognized as disabled veterans and receive disability benefits.

According to BBC Persian, the only Iranian authority addressing the situation of landmine victims is the “Article 2 Commissions” stationed within Iranian governorates, consisting of eight members including representatives from military and security agencies, as well as the Foundation of Martyrs and Veterans Affairs, an Iranian foundation that receives its funding directly from the national budget which gives home loans to disabled veterans and to the families of soldiers killed in action.

However, there is no representative from the victims’ side in these commissions. The Commissions are formed at the provincial level where the incident occurred, reviewing the evidence provided by the victim and determining whether they qualify as a martyr (soldiers killed in action) or disabled veteran. If the Article 2 Commission recognizes the individual as a disabled veteran, the Foundation of Martyrs and Veterans Affairs provides them with a pension; otherwise, they receive support from other welfare organizations such as relief committees that are Iranian charitable organizations providing support for poor families or the State Welfare Organization of Iran, also known as the Behzisti Organization.

Lawyers and civil activists argue that Article 2 Commissions often fail to recognize border couriers as disabled for various reasons. These include stepping on mines while crossing into Iraqi territory, engaging in illegal border crossing, having relatives involved in Kurdish anti-government groups, or smuggling alcohol from Iraq.

Lack of Access to Remedy and Justice

Human Rights Watch reviewed court documents of five people who were injured by Iranian security forces. Review of legal documents reveals that complaints filed by those who have been shot are often dismissed under Article 3, Clause 9 of the law on security forces’ use of arms. However, interviewees who were granted compensation by the authorities said that it had never been paid, or never paid in full.

In 2022, an investigative court of the Military Prosecutor’s Office in West Azerbaijan addressed a case involving a shooting in violation of regulations. In 2021, members of the border patrol had fired at border couriers in the “no man’s land” area of the border, resulting in a person’s death. Based on Article 265 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 2013, the authorities issued a non-prosecution order for the shooter.

A 41-year-old man, who was shot and lost his eyes while working as a border courier in 2017, shared his court documents with Human Rights Watch. According to the proceedings in 2020, a Military Court in West Azerbaijan, issued a non-prosecution order for the defendants. The court eventually ordered the border guards to pay him blood money, but he said that he has not yet received any compensation.

In May 2022, a military court in the West Azerbaijan province sentenced a border patrol officer to pay full blood money and a fine of 30 million Iranian rials (approximately US$100 at the time) as an alternative to imprisonment for what it ruled was the involuntary manslaughter of Naser Ebrahimzadeh, who was in a vehicle near the border.

In 2018, a Military Court in West Azerbaijan reviewed the case of the firing of more than 100 Kalashnikov bullets by the border guards in West Azerbaijan towards border couriers, which resulted in a man being injured in the right shoulder in 2017. A verdict also ordered blood money.

Human Rights Watch also reviewed court documents of a man injured in a landmine incident. In this case not only was he not compensated but the court found him guilty of illegal border crossing.

A 33-year-old man, who lost his leg in 2020 due to a mine explosion while working as a border courier, received medical treatment in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) and returned to Iran. He was summoned by a Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office in West Azerbaijan on charges of illegal border crossing. Ultimately, an appellate court freed him, but confiscated his passport, and placed him under a travel ban.

In 2022, a local Iranian lawyers’ office addressed the review of unresolved cases of landmine victims in the letter to a governor in West Azerbaijan province. The lawyers cited over 400 unresolved cases, some dating back more than 25 years, that have been brought to the attention of the governor's office without receiving any response.

The lawyers said that because of the government’s failure to clear landmines, it has the responsibility to support and compensate the victims.

(Beirut) – A Saudi court has sentenced a man to 20 years in prison on charges related to his peaceful social media activity, Human Rights Watch said today. The conviction is the latest example of Saudi Arabia’s likely transnational repression due to his family member’s activities abroad and yet another escalation in the country’s ever-worsening crackdown on freedom of expression and other basic rights.

On May 29, 2024, Saudi Arabia’s counterterrorism tribunal, the Specialized Criminal Court, convicted Asaad al-Ghamdi, 47, a Saudi teacher, of several criminal offenses related solely to his peaceful expression online. He is the brother of Mohammed al-Ghamdi, a retired Saudi teacher, who was sentenced to death in July 2023 based solely on his posts on X, formerly known as Twitter, and YouTube activity. Saeed bin Nasser al-Ghamdi, a third brother, is a well-known Saudi Islamic scholar and government critic living in exile in the United Kingdom. Saudi authorities often retaliate against the family members of critics and dissidents abroad in an effort to coerce them to return to the country.

“Saudi courts mete out decades long sentences to ordinary citizens for nothing more than peacefully expressing themselves online,” said Joey Shea, Saudi Arabia researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The government should also stop punishing family members of critics living abroad.”

Saudi security forces arrested Asaad al-Ghamdi on November 20, 2022, in a nighttime raid on his home in the al-Hamdaneyah neighborhood of Jeddah, while his wife and children looked on, informed sources told Human Rights Watch. Security forces confiscated electronic devices and ransacked every room of the house. He was not informed of the reasons for the arrest or of the charges against him.

The authorities held him in the Dhahban prison in Jeddah, initially in solitary confinement for three months. Al-Ghamdi was also held incommunicado for nearly two months, and only received his first visit from family members on January 11, 2023.

In a tweet in July 2023 in response to Mohammed al-Ghamdi’s death sentence, Saeed, the third brother, wrote that the “false ruling aims to spite me personally after failed attempts by the investigations to return me to the country.”

Court documents reviewed by Human Rights Watch show that authorities charged Asaad al-Ghamdi with Articles 30, 34, 43, and 44 of Saudi Arabia’s counterterrorism law: the same articles used in July 2023 to sentence his brother Mohammed al-Ghamdi to death. The documents show that Asaad al-Ghamdi was charged with “challenging the religion and justice of the King and the Crown Prince” and “publishing false and malicious news and rumors.” The documents state that al-Ghamdi was arrested “for publishing posts that harmed the security of the homeland on social media websites (Twitter).”

Informed sources told Human Rights Watch that tweets used as evidence against him criticized projects related to Vision 2030, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s program for diversifying the country’s economy, as well as the recent changes in the Saudi government, referring to “its abandonment of the old religious alliance.” One tweet mourned Dr. Abdallah al-Hamed, the founder of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association and a leading Saudi human rights figure who died in prison following his conviction on charges relating to peace peaceful human rights activism, and offered condolences to his family.

The documents cite al-Ghamdi’s X social media posts as evidence against him and sought the maximum penalty for each article he was charged under. The prosecution also asked the authorities to confiscate al-Ghamdi’s mobile device and close his X account, the court documents say.

Saudi authorities held al-Ghamid’s first trial session on September 7, 2023, in Riyadh and only then informed him of the charges against him. The court in late August appointed a lawyer, who later refused to provide him or his family with any court documents related to the case. The lawyer only met al-Ghamdi in court during the trial sessions and never travelled to Jeddah to meet with him outside of the court sessions. The lawyer often refused to meet with his family and failed to share pertinent information about the case with them.

Informed sources said that the lawyer also refused to present evidence of al-Ghamdi’s health condition in court, despite urgings by al-Ghamdi’s family, who apparently believed this could be a useful defense.

Al-Ghamdi suffers from epilepsy, which requires consistent medical attention to manage adequately. He has not received such care during his detention, the informed sources said. In one episode, al-Ghamdi remained unconscious in the bathroom for hours. “He had a spasm and he fell and broke his finger and his tooth,” the source said. “When other inmates saw that he was late in the toilet they went to check on him and found his blood everywhere.” Prison authorities later took him to a general physician in the prison but not a specialist, which he requires.

Informed sources had expressed concern to Human Rights Watch about Asaad’s brother Mohammed, who was sentenced to death based solely on his peaceful social media activity. Mohammad al-Ghamdi also suffers from epilepsy and his health has significantly deteriorated in detention. Sources said that prison authorities ignored Mohammed al-Ghamdi’s repeated requests to see a doctor or visit a hospital until his pain became unbearable. When prison authorities finally allowed him to see a doctor, the general practitioner did not provide him with any medication.

Saudi authorities should immediately provide both Asaad and Mohammad al-Ghamdi with medical attention, including specialists able to treat their health conditions and adequate medications.

Human Rights Watch has repeatedly criticized rampant abuses in Saudi Arabia’s criminal justice system, including long periods of detention without charge or trial, denial of legal assistance, and the courts’ reliance on torture-tainted confessions as the sole basis of conviction. The violations of defendants’ rights are so fundamental and systemic that it is hard to reconcile Saudi Arabia’s criminal justice system with a system based on the basic principles of the rule of law and international human rights standards.

“Yet another outrageous, decades-long sentence demonstrates that the Saudi authorities are willing to crush any and all dissent,” Shea said. “Saudi Arabia’s allies should condemn these sentences and demand that the Saudi government release the prisoners and end their repressive practices.”",VERY HIGH,20240709T154500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Asaad al-Ghamdi, Mohammed al-Ghamdi, Saeed bin Nasser al-Ghamdi, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman",Saudi Arabian government,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",Immediate medical attention for both prisoners; end suppression of free speech,Unlawfully sentencing individuals for peaceful expression,Saudi Arabia,"Government crackdown on dissent, family retaliation"

Amid the widespread civilian suffering in Sudan, the fate of over one million refugees living in Sudan when the conflict erupted is often overlooked.

In recent weeks, Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) attacked towns across Sennar state, which neighbors Gedaref state and where more than 40,000 refugees from Ethiopia are currently hosted. In Kassala state, further east, Eritreans fleeing repression and indefinite forced conscription at home continue to arrive in the camps.

“If the fighting approaches Gedaref and Kassala, we will not be safe,” an Ethiopian refugee told me last month; these fears are now even more justified.

Since conflict erupted in Sudan, Ethiopian refugees, mainly hosted in Gedaref, have been raising very real concerns about their safety and the lack of humanitarian support. Some have independently sought ways to leave the camps, but many thousands remain.

Without a clear protection or evacuation strategy, those in the camps could face violence or targeted attacks by warring parties, especially following accusations by the RSF that Tigrayan forces were fighting alongside Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF). Refugees also face the risk of mass arrests by SAF-aligned authorities in towns in Gedaref state, with reports that some Ethiopians have already been detained.

Some Ethiopian refugees understandably fear returning home as the real risk of violence or persecution that made them refugees may still persist. The majority in Gedaref’s two camps, and some in Kassala, are from Ethiopia’s Western Tigray Zone and fled a brutal ethnic cleansing campaign against Tigrayans during Ethiopia’s two-year conflict. Those responsible for these crimes still control the area, and Human Rights Watch continues to receive reports of forces forcefully expelling Tigrayans, with Ethiopian military complicity, to other parts of Tigray. Here they join hundreds of thousands of other internally displaced people facing dismal conditions.

Ethiopian authorities have reportedly formed a committee to return refugees in Sudan to Ethiopia, but refugees inside the camps need travel permits from the Sudanese authorities. It is critical that United Nations agencies work with Sudanese and Ethiopian authorities to assist refugees seeking to leave with safe, dignified, voluntary, and organized pathways, while ensuring that no one is coerced or forced to return to locations where they would face serious risks. Organizations and the international community should consider all possible means of support, including cash and transport, to ensure that refugees are moved out of harm’s way.

In June, Kazakhstan’s Ministry of Culture and Information said it was reviewing a petition, “We Are against Open and Hidden LGBT Propaganda in Kazakhstan!” initiated by the head of Kazakhstan’s Union of Parents, a public association, after the petition met threshold requirements to be considered by the government.

The government of Kazakhstan should reject this discriminatory and stigmatizing petition, whose proposal would violate human rights across the country.

The petition, seen by Human Rights Watch, calls on Kazakh authorities to introduce a law banning so-called “open and hidden LGBT propaganda in Kazakhstan” and impose penalties for such material, under the guise of “protecting children.” It could potentially lead to draft legislation or amendments of existing laws. The law on petitions gives the ministry 40 working days to review the petition and a response is anticipated by August 5.

The petition falls outside the criteria set out in national legislation, which explicitly excludes proposals that flout “human rights and freedoms.” The content of the petition openly discriminates against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people and misuses the rhetoric of protecting children to restrict fundamental freedoms. It refers to Russia’s laws banning “nontraditional sexual relationships propaganda,” which have been universally condemned by human rights bodies. If taken up, this “propaganda” proposal would breach Kazakhstan’s international human rights obligations on nondiscrimination and freedom of expression, opinion, information, association, and assembly.

Despite its international obligations, Kazakhstan does not include sexual orientation or gender identity as a ground for protection against discrimination in its laws, and authorities have in the past denied registration to nongovernmental organization engaged in LGBT rights activism. In 2023, the United Nations Committee against Torture expressed concern about “violence against individuals on the basis of their actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity” and called on the authorities to end such violence.

Harassment, discrimination, and the threat of violence already color the everyday lives of LGBT people in Kazakhstan. If authorities choose to support this petition, they would be making a difficult reality even worse by endorsing discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

Kazakhstan’s international partners should publicly condemn attempts to glorify homophobic and transphobic rhetoric. The government should immediately halt this harmful proposal and work with human rights organizations and LGBT activists to improve protections rather than eroding them.",HIGH,20240710T060000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Head of Kazakhstan's Union of Parents, Kazakh authorities",Kazakhstan's Ministry of Culture and Information,Kazakhstan,"Reject the petition, enhance protections for LGBT rights, collaborate with human rights organizations",Discrimination against LGBT individuals through a proposed law banning LGBT propaganda,Kazakhstan,"Cultural stigma against LGBT individuals, influence of Russian laws on LGBT"

(Johannesburg) – Zimbabwe’s army commander has openly stated that the country’s security forces intend to play a partisan political role, threatening future elections and those participating in them, Human Rights Watch said today.

On June 29, 2024, the Zimbabwe National Army commander, Lt. General Anselem Sanyatwe, was quoted as saying that people would be marched to polling stations “whether you like it or not,” and that the ruling party, ZANU-PF, would “rule forever.” Since the August 2023 general election, in which ZANU-PF failed to win an outright majority in parliament, the country has witnessed several by-elections in constituencies where opposition members of parliament were dismissed in a bizarre ploy. The dismissals were seen as an attempt to tilt the balance of power in ZANU-PF’s favor.

“The Zimbabwe military commander’s open endorsement of the ruling party not only threatens the fairness of elections but opens the door for security force abuses against voters, the opposition, and civil society organizations,” said Allan Ngari, Africa advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. “Zimbabwe’s security forces need to comply with the country’s laws and regulations that uphold its international human rights obligations to ensure that elections are free and fair.”

For decades, Zimbabwe’s military and other state security forces have interfered in the nation’s political and electoral affairs in violation of citizens’ civil and political rights. Zimbabwe’s constitution states that no member of the security services in exercising their functions may act in a partisan manner, further the interests of any political party, or cause or violate anyone’s fundamental rights or freedoms. However, senior members of the security forces have routinely ignored these provisions with impunity.

The government should take urgent steps to end the military’s participation in partisan politics, including by disciplining or prosecuting military officers who violate laws and regulations that prohibit the security forces from directly supporting any political party.

Zimbabwe has a history of elections that fall far short of international and regional standards, characterized by the involvement of the military in deeply flawed electoral processes. The government has not remedied some of the flaws of the August 2023 election that Southern African Development Community (SADC) observers documented.

Election periods in Zimbabwe, especially in 1985, 1990, 2000, 2002, 2005, and 2008, were characterized by widespread political violence, committed mainly by ZANU-PF, its allies, and government security agencies, including sections of the army.

These problems were particularly evident during the 2008 elections, when the army was credibly implicated in numerous systematic abuses that led to the killing of up to 200 people, the beating and torture of 5,000 more, and the displacement of 36,000.

The 2017 coup against President Robert Mugabe further entrenched the military in its partisanship with the ruling party and interference in civilian affairs. The military leadership and some sections of the army have, since the coup, taken highly visible steps that adversely affect the political environment.

Lt. General Sanyatwe’s recent statements that militate against the holding of free, fair, and credible elections raise the urgency to carry out reforms to ensure that state security forces do not threaten future democratic elections and the electoral affairs of the country, Human Rights Watch said.

Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Zimbabwe is party, states that every citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without discrimination because of political opinion or other unreasonable restrictions, “to vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot, guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors.”

SADC heads of state, who will meet on August 17 in Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare, for their 44th summit, should press the Zimbabwe government to ensure the political neutrality of its security forces and noninterference in the country’s civilian and electoral affairs.

Zimbabwe is party to the SADC Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic Elections, established to promote regular free and fair, transparent, credible and peaceful democratic elections. Under these principles, countries commit to take all necessary measures and precautions to prevent political violence, intolerance and intimidation, including ensuring the neutrality of security forces in providing election security.

“Security force commanders need to speak and act in a manner that reflects a strictly neutral political position in accordance with Zimbabwe’s constitution and international law,” Ngari said. “Authorities should take appropriate disciplinary action against officers in the security forces, regardless of rank, who violate laws and regulations prohibiting partisan conduct.”",HIGH,20240710T191500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Lt.

(Beirut) – Incoming Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian should confront widespread rights violations by government agencies, including Iran’s security forces and the judiciary, Human Rights Watch said today. On July 5, 2024, Pezeshkian defeated Saeed Jalili in the second round of Iran’s presidential elections.

“Incoming Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian should confront Iran’s egregious human rights abuses, including alarming rates of executions, systemic oppression of women, and brutal repression of ethnic and religious minorities,” said Nahid Naghshbandi, acting Iran researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Ending impunity for these injustices is essential for Pezeshkian to show Iranians that the government can address their legitimate, widespread grievances and demands for fundamental change.”

A significant number of people and civil society groups boycotted the election. According to Shargh daily, the voter turnout in the election’s first round was 39.96 percent, the lowest turnout in Iran’s presidential election history, although the second round participation rate increased to 49.8 percent.

Nine women political prisoners and 55 political and civil activists inside and outside Iran, including the 2023 Nobel Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi, also emphasized in separate statements that liberation cannot be achieved through ballot boxes and the dire situation of the country will not improve with “vote therapy.” Signatories of these statements included prominent Iranian activists.

The elections were neither free nor fair. Before the election, the Guardian Council, a body of 12 male religious jurists and legal experts responsible for vetting candidates, disqualified many candidates without providing a reason, including several prominent government officials. Ali Larijani, the former speaker of parliament, and Eshaq Jahangiri, the first vice president from 2013 until 2021 in Hassan Rouhani's government, were among them. Notably, the Guardian Council has never approved a female presidential candidate.

Pezeshkian will start his presidency in August facing significant challenges. Considerable social discontent, reflected in low election participation and repeated protests along with a weak economy, are major domestic issues. The “Woman, Life, Freedom” movement and the government's brutal response have highlighted the dire state of human rights.

According to a recent Amnesty International report, Iran executed 853 people in 2023, the highest in eight years, including 481 for drug-related offenses. By March 20, at least 95 executions had been recorded during 2024. The Baluch ethnic minority, five percent of Iran's population, constituted 20 percent of people executed in 2023, with at least 172 Baluch individuals executed. A 2023 report by Iran Human Rights revealed increased executions targeting ethnic minorities in provinces such as West Azerbaijan, East Azerbaijan, Sistan and Baluchistan, and Kurdistan, with 130 executions in 2022 compared with 62 such executions in 2021 and 60 in 2020.

Pezeshkian indirectly referenced the government’s alarming use of executions in a televised debate response to Saeed Jalili, the other candidate in the runoff election. During the debate, broadcast by an Iran state television channel on July 1, Pezeshkian said: “I will withdraw from the elections if Mr. Jalili commits that if he fails to achieve eight percent economic growth in his government, they should execute him.”

Pezeshkian should also address the extensive legal and social barriers that curtail women’s lives and their access to economic opportunities, perpetuating significant gender disparities. Iran ranks poorly in global gender equality assessments, particularly in economic participation. These challenges are compounded by systematic violations of women’s rights, including Article 638 of Iran’s Islamic Penal Code, which criminalizes not wearing a “proper” hijab. The law imposes up to two months in prison and fines for the women accused of violations, in violation of their rights to privacy and nondiscrimination.

On June 21, during the third debate among the presidential candidates, Pezeshkian said: “Regarding hijab, we should not enforce it in a way that leads to dissatisfaction. Even with coercion, we cannot force our children and grandchildren into something.”

This pledge came two years after the death of Mahsa Jina Amini in custody by morality police, which sparked the 2022 nationwide protests. Iran has introduced a revamped morality police, known as “Plan Noor,” and passed a “Chastity and Hijab Bill” in parliament.

Iranian authorities’ repression of ethnic and religious minorities has also been brutal over the past several years. Human Rights Watch has documented the use of excessive and lethal force against protesters in areas with large Kurdish and Baluch populations, as well as the use of rape and torture in detention facilities in Kurdish, Baluch, and Azeri areas. In April 2024, Human Rights Watch released a report in which researchers found that decades-long systematic repression of the Baha’i minority amounts to the crime against humanity of persecution.

On June 22, during a gathering in Sanandaj, in Kurdistan province, Pezeshkian outlined the urgent need to address underdeveloped regions, particularly those near borders. “I will definitely put an end to regional injustices,” he said. The effectiveness of his plans remains to be seen given previous administrations’ failures in addressing these inequalities, Human Rights Watch said. Under both Hassan Rouhani and Ebrahim Raeesi’s presidential administrations, oppression against religious and ethnic minorities continued undiminished.

In foreign policy, the Iranian president and foreign minister face limitations on their decision-making, as decisions by the executive branch and Foreign Ministry are overseen not only by the supreme leader but also by powerful actors like the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Beyond its repressive domestic role, the Guard Corps leads Iran's regional policies, managing alliances from Yemen to Lebanon.

“Rebuilding trust with people in Iran requires more than promises that have been unmet for years,” Naghshbandi said. “It demands immediate, tangible action to improve the human rights of people across the country. A meaningful first step would be for Pezeshkian to order the release of all detained activists, peaceful protesters, and human rights defenders, who never should have been jailed in the first place.”",VERY HIGH,20240712T173000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Masoud Pezeshkian, Narges Mohammadi, Nahid Naghshbandi","Iranian government, security forces, judiciary",Iran,"Immediate action to improve human rights, release of detained activists, and addressing systemic injustices","Widespread human rights violations including executions, oppression of women, and repression of ethnic/religious minorities",Iran,"Systematic oppression, historical discrimination against minorities, economic hardships"

It’s time to change the metric by which much of the world traditionally measures economic wellbeing: gross domestic product (GDP). The drive for steadily higher GDP growth is fueling environmental disasters and worsening the lives of billions of people.

Instead of giving attention to GDP, governments should focus on developing a human rights economy which builds an economic system that enables all people to realize their human rights on a livable planet.

Fundamentally changing our economic system seems like an insurmountable challenge. But there are concrete actions states and international institutions can take to build an economic system that achieves progress for all, not just some, and safeguards our environment.

The missing ingredient from the international system is human rights. A human rights economy is experienced on a local level – by all people enjoying their rights like quality public services, universal social security systems, and fair and living wages and safe working conditions, not to mention a livable planet – but it is enabled on the global level by rewriting the rules of the global economic system to more equitably distribute global resources between countries.

Taking steps on a path towards a human rights economy was the theme of a July 2 event of the United Nations Human Rights Council. Governments from four regions – Malaysia, The Gambia, Chile, Panama, and Spain – joined with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and eight civil society organizations that work on economic justice, including Human Rights Watch, in the event on the sidelines of a UN Human Rights Council (HRC) session. It built on similar discussions that took place at the HRC session in October 2023 and at a HRC intersessional meeting in January 2024, reflecting momentum for change. Around 80 people attended, including representatives from 25 states.

At the July 2 session, the inadequacies of GDP alone as a measure for how countries and citizens are faring was a common theme. In her opening remarks, Malaysia’s ambassador to the UN, Dato’ Nadzirah Osman, said her country seeks to “collaborate with like-minded countries and international organisations to promote a fairer and sustainable global economic order, based on the principles of human rights. Malaysia is committed to playing its part in this transformation. By fostering an economy that values well-being over mere GDP growth, we can build a more just, equitable and sustainable world for all.”

Olivier de Schutter, UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, struck similar notes. “For decades, GDP growth was the dominant approach for eradicating poverty, but it never fulfilled its promise and devastated our planet,” he said. ""One concrete step that can be taken to achieve a ‘human rights economy’ is to replace GDP and a focus on growth with measures of progress grounded in human rights: meeting the challenges of the climate crisis, addressing inequalities, and eradicating poverty.”

Surya Deva, UN Special Rapporteur on the right to development, told the gathering that the current economic development model has serious deficits, as poverty isn’t being reduced enough and inequality is rising: the benefits of economic growth are not getting shared equitably. He asserted that the right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment is as important as the right to development. Also, “there is not enough or meaningful participation of people in development policies, plans and projects, leading to social conflicts and attacks against human rights defenders. In view of these development deficits, we should look for a new model of economic development. I am calling it a planet-centered participatory model of development.”

Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan have committed widespread acts of sexual violence in areas of Khartoum over which they exercise control, acts that constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity .

and . Both the RSF and the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) have attacked healthcare workers, local responders, and healthcare facilities, which are war crimes.

The African Union and the United Nations should urgently deploy a civilian protection force, and states should take steps to hold those responsible for sexual violence accountable.

(Nairobi) – Sudan’s warring parties, particularly the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), have committed widespread acts of rape, including gang rape, and forced women and girls into marriages in Khartoum, the country’s capital, since the current conflict’s onset, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today.

The 89-page report, ““Khartoum is Not Safe for Women”: Sexual Violence against Women and Girls in Sudan’s Capital,” documents widespread sexual violence, as well as forced and child marriage during the conflict, in Khartoum and its sister cities. Service providers treating and supporting victims also heard reports from women and girls of being held by the RSF in conditions that could amount to sexual slavery. The research also highlights the devastating health and mental health consequences for survivors and the destructive impact of warring parties’ attacks on health care and the Sudanese Armed Forces’ (SAF) willful blocking of aid.

“The Rapid Support Forces have raped, gang raped, and forced into marriage countless women and girls in residential areas in Sudan’s capital,” said Laetitia Bader, deputy Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “The armed group has terrorized women and girls and both warring parties have blocked them from getting aid and support services, compounding the harm they face and leaving them to feel that nowhere is safe.”

It is of paramount importance to hear directly from sexual violence survivors themselves, their experiences, views, and demands should be heard in a safe and dignified manner. Given restrictions on access to Khartoum, security challenges, lack of services for survivors, and logistical barriers, Human Rights Watch, with a few exceptions, for this report interviewed 42 health care providers, social workers, counsellors, lawyers, and local responders in the emergency response rooms that they have established in Khartoum between September 2023 and February 2024.

Eighteen of the healthcare providers had provided direct medical care or psychosocial support to survivors of sexual violence, or managed individual incidents. They said they had cared for a total of 262 survivors of sexual violence from ages 9 through 60 between the conflict’s onset in April 2023 and February 2024.

“I have slept with a knife under my pillow for months in fear from the raids that lead to rape by RSF,” a 20-year-old woman living in an area controlled by the RSF told Human Rights Watch in early 2024. “Since this war started, it is not safe anymore to be a woman living in Khartoum under RSF.”

The physical, emotional, social, and psychological scars left on the survivors are immense, Human Rights Watch found. Healthcare workers encountered survivors seeking assistance for debilitating physical injuries they experienced during rapes and gang rapes. At least four of the women died as a result. Many survivors who sought to terminate pregnancies resulting from rape faced significant barriers to abortion care. Survivors described or showed symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress and depression, including suicidal thoughts, anxiety, fear, and sleeplessness.

“I spoke to a survivor who was raped and had just discovered she was three months pregnant,” a psychiatrist said. “She was clearly traumatized and shivering, afraid of how her family would react. She said to me, ‘If they discover my situation, they will kill me.’”

Survivors told the medical providers that they were raped by as many as five RSF fighters. The RSF have also abducted women and girls and confined them in homes and other facilities they occupied in Khartoum, Bahri, and Omdurman, subjecting them to sexual violence and other abuse. RSF members have sometimes sexually assaulted women and girls in front of their family members. The RSF also forced women and girls into marriages.

Fewer cases were attributed to the Sudanese Armed Forces members, but an uptick in cases was reported after SAF took control of Omdurman in early 2024. Men and boys have also been raped, including in detention.

Both warring parties have blocked survivors’ access to critical and comprehensive emergency health care, Human Rights Watch found.

SAF has willfully restricted humanitarian supplies, including medical supplies, and aid workers’ access, imposing a de facto blockade on medical supplies entering RSF-controlled areas of Khartoum since at least October 2023. The RSF have pillaged medical supplies and occupied medical facilities.

Local responders have been compelled to play the leading role in responding to sexual violence. They are paying a heavy price, as both warring parties have intimidated, arbitrarily detained and attacked doctors, nurses, and emergency care volunteers, including because they support rape survivors. In several instances, RSF members committed sexual violence against the service providers, they said.

Conflict-related sexual violence is a war crime. As is the case with forced marriage, when sexual violence is committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population, as is happening in Sudan, it may also be investigated and prosecuted as a crime against humanity, Human Rights Watch said.

The willful obstruction or arbitrary restriction of humanitarian aid also violates international humanitarian law, and pillaging as well as attacks targeted at civilians, including health care workers and first responders, constitute war crimes. Intentionally directing attacks against humanitarian assistance operations, including personnel, premises, and vehicles, is also a discrete war crime prosecutable under the statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC).

Neither warring party has taken meaningful steps to prevent its forces from committing rape or attacking health care, nor to independently and transparently investigate crimes committed by their forces, Human Rights Watch found. On July 23, the RSF spokesperson wrote to Human Rights Watch rejecting claims that the RSF occupies any hospitals or medical centers in the three cities of Khartoum State. He did not provide evidence that it has carried out effective investigations into allegations of sexual violence by its forces, far less hold any to account.

The African Union and the United Nations should immediately work together to deploy a new mission to protect civilians in Sudan, including preventing sexual and gender-based violence, supporting delivery of comprehensive services to all survivors, and documenting conflict-related sexual violence. The mission should have a mandate and capacity to monitor the obstruction of, and facilitate access to, humanitarian assistance.

International donors need to urgently increase political and financial support to local responders. Countries should work together to impose targeted sanctions on commanders responsible for sexual violence, and attacks on healthcare workers and local responders. UN member states, particularly from the region, should continue to support international investigations into these crimes, including by the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission for Sudan. The United Nations should prioritize ensuring that it rebuilds capacity to respond to conflict related sexual violence across its system.

“Women, men, and children at imminent risk of abuses or who have survived rape in Khartoum and beyond should know that the world is willing to protect them, and guarantee their access to support services and justice,” Bader said. “The United Nations and African Union need to mobilize this protection and states should hold to account those responsible for ongoing sexual violence, attacks on local responders, health facilities, and the blocking of aid.”",VERY HIGH,20240729T074500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Laetitia Bader, deputy Africa director at Human Rights Watch",Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF),"Khartoum, Bahri, and Omdurman","Urgent increase in support for local responders, sanctions against responsible commanders, deployment of civilian protection forces",Widespread acts of sexual violence including rape and forced marriages,Sudan,Ongoing armed conflict in Sudan between RSF and SAF

Earlier this month, people being detained at California Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities began a labor and hunger strike to protest their conditions, including against the use of solitary confinement. Recent research documented the deep physical and psychological toll wrought by the use of solitary confinement in United States immigration detention centers.

Across the US, carceral facilities lock up over 122,000 people daily in solitary confinement for 22 or more hours a day. In the last five years, ICE alone has locked people in solitary confinement over 14,000 times, often for months on end.

Human Rights Watch has condemned solitary confinement practices in the US, including in immigration detention centers.

From 2018 to 2023, the average period for which ICE detention facilities imposed solitary confinement was 27 days. In hundreds of cases, solitary confinement lasted at least 90 days, and in 42 cases lasted over a year. This violates international standards barring prolonged or indefinite solitary confinement, which amounts to prohibited torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.

UN Special Rapporteur on Torture Juan Méndez has specifically concluded that solitary confinement beyond 15 days constitutes a “form of torture.” The use of solitary confinement for any duration on children and people with psychosocial disabilities also meets these criteria.

For people in US immigration detention, solitary confinement often compounds the effects of previous traumatic experiences. Segregation can cause people’s mental health to deteriorate, and they are unlikely to receive appropriate or timely mental health care. Solitary confinement is linked to anxiety, depression, and psychosis. Even a few days in solitary significantly heightens the risk of death by suicide. A recent report documented dozens of preventable deaths in ICE detention facilities, including many individuals who died by suicide after spending time in solitary confinement.

ICE’s use of solitary confinement disproportionally targets people with psychosocial disabilities and African and Caribbean immigrants. Black immigrants are overrepresented by a factor of 6.8 in solitary confinement cases.

Immigration detention itself should only be used as a tool of last resort, and the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has called for it to be gradually abolished.

Recent statements by senior Nigerian government officials and security agencies regarding the planned nationwide protests raise serious concerns. The officials' rhetoric suggests a troubling readiness to stifle dissent, heightening fears of a violent crackdown.

Calls to protest emerged following recent demonstrations in Kenya against increased taxes on essential goods and have gained traction on social media in Nigeria using the hashtag #EndBadGovernance. The Kenyan protests evolved into broader demands for government reforms, which appears to resonate with many Nigerians facing the worst cost of living crisis in nearly 30 years. By June 2024, Nigeria's inflation rate hit 34.19%, with food inflation exceeding 40%.

Organizers of the planned protests, scheduled to begin on August 1, say they are aimed at addressing both economic hardships and longstanding systemic issues, such as corruption.

Media reports quote President Tinubu and senior administration officials labeling the protests as unwarranted and politically motivated. The Department of State Services alleged the protests are intended to undermine the government and create conditions for “regime change” and will be used to incite chaos and violence. Similarly, the military warned that the protests could lead to anarchy and has promised to take proactive measures to maintain control. The police have cautioned against the protests, suggesting they could be used as a cover to unleash terror.

These pre-emptive warnings are troubling, especially given the Nigerian security forces' history of violently repressing peaceful protest. The brutal crackdown of the #EndSARS protests in October 2020, when military and police officers fired on unarmed protesters, killing at least 12, remains fresh in the memory. A recent Economic Community of West Africa Court ruling found that the Nigerian government had violated protesters' rights during the #EndSARS protests.

Rather than undermining the right to protest, authorities should address the underlying issues that are driving the protests.

The European Commission’s annual Rule of Law Report 2024 glosses over serious threats to civil society in the European Union, sending a message that the EU doesn’t take the decline of civic space in its member states seriously enough.

In the report, published July 24, the commission recognizes the essential role civil society plays, but despite mounting evidence, fails to identify intimidation and interference with the work of civil society organizations as a core challenge.

In France, civil society is curtailed by regulations, threats of cuts in state funding, and the dissolution of associations. Excessive force is often used to police protests and environmental activists face stigmatizing rhetoric and harsh penalties for their actions. Although the report praises the financial health of civil society organizations in France, it notes concerns about subsidy withdrawal and stigmatization but does not address these issues in its recommendations.

In Greece and Italy, civil society organizations, especially those working on migrant and asylum seekers’ rights, are heavily obstructed and subjected to criminalization and harassment. The report touches on some of these issues but does not address their full range or severity or direct specific recommendations to the government.

In Hungary, repressive legislation and the vilification of civil society are used to stifle civic engagement, creating a climate of fear and censorship. Even though the report mentions these issues, the commission settles for a generic recommendation to remove obstacles affecting civil society organizations and foster a safe and enabling civic space, instead of providing clear calls for action.

Civic space in Germany has diminished over the past year due to restrictions on protests and assemblies. The commission notes that Germany has not made progress in implementing new regulations to clarify the tax-exempt status of nonprofit organizations, which can negatively impact donations and public funding access. However, its recommendations do not address broader restrictions, such as pre-emptive detention of protesters and blanket protest bans.

The EU’s failure to recognize the significance of the problems facing civil society comes at a time when repressive legislation and intensified crackdowns are on the rise in its surrounding neighborhood. Those governments will only be emboldened by EU inaction at home.

(Nairobi) – The Kenyan government and International Monetary Fund should work together to ensure that the IMF program and its implementation align with human rights, Human Rights Watch said today. The focus should be on progressive revenue generation and accountability over public funds.

Following the recent nationwide protests, President William Ruto declined to sign Finance Bill 2024, which included regressive tax measures that risked undermining rights. Any alternative measures should relieve economic pressures by addressing the root causes of protesters’ anger.

“The widespread outrage sparked by proposed taxes on goods like sanitary pads and cooking oil in a country where corporate tax evasion is endemic should be a wake-up call to the Kenyan government and the IMF that they cannot sacrifice rights in the name of economic recovery,” said Sarah Saadoun, senior researcher on poverty and inequality at Human Rights Watch. “Economic sustainability can only be achieved with a new social contract that raises revenues fairly, manages them responsibly, and funds services and programs that allow everyone to realize their rights.”

Finance Bill 2024, in the context of an IMF program with Kenya, was expected to raise US$2.7 billion in additional revenues in the upcoming fiscal year, in part to meet IMF targets. The bill included several new tax provisions, such as removing exemptions from certain food items and a mobile money transfer tax, that would increase the cost of essential goods and services and fall heaviest on Kenyans with lower and middle incomes, as well as already marginalized groups such as women.

The IMF program was approved in 2021 to support Kenya’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic and global inflation, as well as devastating cycles of droughts and floods made worse by climate change. An increase in interest rates has also forced the government to spend upward of half its tax revenues to service debt.

The Kenyan government has other options to raise revenue progressively and enhance trust in the government, Human Rights Watch said. Kenya’s tax-to-GDP ratio is around 15 percent, which is the minimum threshold according to the World Bank for a viable state and economic stability.

The government could introduce tax reforms to better enforce existing tax rules, tackle mismanagement and corruption, and increase taxation on the wealthiest. Taxes on industries or products that harm the environment should also be designed so that they do not undermine rights, such as by using the revenues raised to compensate for their effects on low and middle-income people.

Under human rights law, governments, and the international financial institutions that support them, are required to respond to economic crises in ways that do everything possible to protect and advance rights. They are expected to conduct and publish human rights impact assessments to ensure that proposed reforms, including to fiscal policy and public spending, best fulfill people’s economic, social, and cultural rights, paying special attention to risks to women and economically marginalized groups. These assessments should be transparent, include public participation, and shape the measures that are ultimately enacted.

The IMF has committed $4.4 billion to Kenya, and the World Bank anticipates $12 billion in support from 2024 to 2026. Yet, the program negotiated with the IMF requires steep spending cuts and increased revenues. A June IMF statement praised the Finance Bill and the upcoming fiscal year’s proposed budget as in line with the required “sizable and upfront fiscal consolidation,” referring to reducing public expenditure or increasing revenues.

Human Rights Watch analysis of such measures shows that they frequently harm human rights. Research has also shown that these measures tend to worsen inequality, and “a large upfront fiscal consolidation can be particularly damaging,” according to the Independent Evaluation Office, an independent IMF entity.

The IMF program in Kenya has already introduced sweeping reforms, some of which exacerbated the cost-of-living crisis. These include doubling the value added tax on fuel without any compensatory measures and other efforts to raise revenues that contributed to financial hardship. Yet, the public has seen little benefit from additional revenues and the government has continued to fall short of IMF targets.

The IMF statement advised strengthening the so-called “social safety net,” referring to social security programs that provide income support, while also expressing support for the approved budget. According to an analysis submitted to the Budget and Appropriations Committee of the National Assembly by Bajeti Hub, a nongovernmental group formerly called International Budget Partnership Kenya that advocates for budget transparency, the budget presented to parliament in April included significant cuts in health, education, social protection, and water and sanitation. In 2022/23, the combined spending on these categories came to only around 6 percent of Kenya’s GDP, or 23 percent of government expenditures. This amount is far below international benchmarks and reflects a continued decrease in social spending in Kenya since 2019.

For health care, the World Health Organization recommends spending a minimum of 5 percent of GDP, and Kenya has agreed to at least 15 precent of government expenditures. Global benchmarks on education recommend spending at least 4 to 6 percent of GDP or 15 to 20 percent of national budgets to meet human rights obligations.

Anger at the bill provoked unprecedented protests across the country and online, which quickly evolved to express broader outrage at the high cost of living, corruption, poor governance, wasteful government spending, and the abysmal state of public services. Protesters said they were particularly incensed that the government would tax sanitary pads, cooking oil, and other basic goods rather than address rampant tax evasion and corruption.

The government responded by brutally cracking down on protesters, killing at least 39 people, according to the Police Reforms Working Group - Kenya. Authorities have continued to target protesters and perceived protest organizers with arbitrary arrests and detentions and, in at least 32 cases, abductions and enforced disappearances. Victims of abductionsreport being tortured by police or suspected state agents, and others have been found dead.

President Ruto sent the bill back to parliament, saying he would instead seek $1.4 billion in expenditure cuts and $1.3 billion in new borrowing. This could be a positive step against regressive tax measures, but protesters have described this as largely inadequate to address the root causes of the country’s problems or to heed public demands for reforms.

In addition, it may create fresh risks to rights, Human Rights Watch said. The president has said he would achieve the cuts by, for example, decreasing travel expenses and eliminating budget lines for the president and deputy president’s spouses, but this is unlikely to be sufficient. To reach $1.4 billion in cuts, the government could further decrease—or, at a minimum, decline to increase—chronically low social spending. A revised budget was published on July 15, but it has yet to be analyzed. At the same time, without the Finance Bill, the IMF’s Executive Board may not approve the release of additional funds.

The IMF should revisit its targets to ensure that it is not impeding the Kenyan government from meeting its human rights obligations and ensure that any policies enacted to achieve program targets do not exacerbate poverty and inequality or undermine rights. To build trust, the IMF and Kenyan government should work together to conduct and publish human rights impact assessments of both the budget and finance bills and amend them to best fulfill their rights obligations, Human Rights Watch said.

The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights noted in its 2016 periodic review of Kenya that “there is a large amount of illicit financial flows and tax avoidance” and “cases of corruption, particularly those involving high-level officials, are not thoroughly investigated.”

Further, Tax Justice Network, a nongovernmental group, ranks Kenya as highly complicit in helping multinational corporations underpay corporate income tax and says that Kenya loses $190 million annually in global tax abuse, largely committed by multinational corporations. This figure is equivalent to 9.5 percent of Kenya’s budget for health and 4 percent of education. Corporations had a tax compliance rate of 70 percent in 2023, according to data from the Kenya Revenue Authority.

Human rights law also obligates other states and public institutions to set a global environment and provide support to Kenya to best fulfill everyone’s economic, social, and cultural rights in the country. This applies, for instance, to global tax rules and the treatment of debt.

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for a “human rights economy.” This concept is rooted in the shared vision of reforming domestic economies and the international financial architecture to enable everyone to realize their economic, social, and cultural rights, as well as the rights to development and to a healthy and sustainable environment.

“Kenyans are expressing the anger of billions of people across the world who are being squeezed dry by an economic system that leaves even well-intentioned governments with little margin to meet their human rights obligations,” Saadoun said. “Only by aligning economic policies with human rights on every level, domestic and international, can we address the root of the problem.”",HIGH,20240716T044500Z,Human Rights Watch,"President William Ruto, Sarah Saadoun",Kenyan Government and IMF,"Nairobi, Kenya","Conduct human rights impact assessments, align economic policies with human rights obligations, reform tax policies and governance practices.",Failure to align economic policies and measures with human rights obligations,Kenya,"Corporate tax evasion, inadequate social spending, corruption"

Thousands of people are being deported every year for drug offenses that in many cases no longer exist under state laws, harming and separating immigrant families.

Punitive federal immigration laws separate families, destabilize communities, and terrorize non-citizens, all while overdose deaths have risen and drugs have become more potent and available.

Congress should reform immigration law to give immigration judges discretion to make individualized decisions. States should ensure drug reforms apply to non-citizens as well.

(Washington, DC, July 15, 2024) – Thousands of people in the United States are being deported every year for drug offenses that in many cases no longer exist under state laws, harming and separating immigrant families, Human Rights Watch and the Drug Policy Alliance said today.

The 91-page report, “Disrupt and Vilify,” shows that the failure to reform disproportionately harsh federal immigration law has resulted in enormous numbers of deportations, splitting families apart, disrupting communities, and destabilizing people well-established in the US. For example, federal immigration law that treats some types of marijuana use as a deportable offense is at odds with many states’ recreational marijuana laws, penalizing immigrants and non-citizens for activities that are legal for citizens at the state level. The groups found that 500,000 people whose most serious offense was for drugs were deported between 2002 and 2020.

“The uniquely American combination of the drug war and deportation machine work hand in hand to target, exclude, and punish noncitizens for minor offenses—or in some states legal activity—such as marijuana possession,” said Maritza Perez Medina, director of federal affairs at the Drug Policy Alliance (DPA). “This report underscores that punitive federal drug laws separate families, destabilize communities, and terrorize non-citizens, all while overdose deaths have risen and drugs have become more potent and available. It’s imperative that the US government revises federal law to match current state-based drug policy reforms to end and prevent the immense human suffering being inflicted in the name of the drug war.”

Human Rights Watch and the Drug Policy Alliance interviewed 42 people affected by the deportations, including immigrants, families, and attorneys. The groups also analyzed new federal government data from 2002 to 2020 and found that 500,000 people have been deported whose most serious offense was drug-related. A previous Human Rights Watch report showed that from 2002 to 2012, 260,000 people were deported for drug-related offenses. This report updates that figure with an additional 240,000 people deported between 2013 and 2020, amounting to about one of every five deportations of immigrants with a criminal conviction during this period.

Overdose numbers have drastically increased, even as the US has engaged in massive numbers of deportations over this period, underscoring the ineffectiveness of such policies and of approaches that vilify immigrants in connection with drugs.

Convictions for even the most minor drug offenses—for example, possessing a small amount of a controlled substance, including marijuana—carry devastating consequences that far outstrip the criminal sentence imposed. The groups found that between 2002 and 2020, the federal government deported at least 156,000 people whose most serious criminal offense was for drug use or possession, including over 47,000 for marijuana use or possession, even though marijuana has been legalized or decriminalized in most states. Often, the offenses that lead to deportation are decades-old or so minor they resulted in little or no prison time. Some would not be criminal offenses if committed today.

“Why should parents or grandparents be deported away from children in their care for decades-old drug offenses, including offenses that would be legal today?” said Vicki Gaubeca, associate US director for immigration and border policy at Human Rights Watch. “If drug conduct is not a crime under state law, it should not make someone deportable.”

The report focuses on deportations from states with large immigrant populations that have advanced drug policy reforms, including California, Illinois, New York, and Texas, and includes cases of:

Refugees and US military veterans separated from their homes and families due to deportations for drug offenses;

Immigrants who have lived in the United States since childhood, but have been deported for drug offenses, sometimes for marijuana offenses that would be legal in their states today;

Immigrant women who were sexually abused by corrections officers during their imprisonment for drug offenses, in part because their abusers knew they would soon be deported;

Immigrants deported due to drug offenses to countries with dangerous human rights conditions, including one man returned to Haiti.

Many of those interviewed faced automatic deportation because immigration law defines their offenses as “drug trafficking aggravated felonies,” which bars them from almost all forms of immigration relief; these include several people whose convictions were for low-level offenses. In such cases, the judge is barred from considering individual factors, like evidence of US family ties, rehabilitation, military service, and other factors, and instead must order the immigrant deported. Some of those interviewed are legal permanent residents who have not been able to become citizens because they have engaged in drug conduct, including conduct that is legal in their states like working in the marijuana industry.

“I’m not able to live and operate without fear because I’m not a citizen,” said a lawful permanent resident in California, who was convicted for marijuana and paraphernalia possession. “I’ve lived here for more than 20 years now. This is my home. I have children here. I want to be a citizen, and I’m making every effort to do that. But it seems like that’s not going to be possible.”

There are significant racial disparities in the imposition of immigration penalties. Overall, the majority of people deported from the United States for criminal offenses are Black and Brown. Even within the category of non-citizens, Black immigrants are disproportionately impacted. More than one out of every five non-citizens facing deportation on criminal grounds before US immigration courts are Black. Black immigrants are more likely to be held in immigration detention longer and are less likely to be granted release.

As the overdose crisis and immigration reform increasingly become a central focus of political debates and campaigns, the Drug Policy Alliance and Human Rights Watch emphasize the need for elected officials to show leadership by heeding the research and embracing evidence-based policies grounded in public health, safety, and human rights.

“Deportation tears families apart, and the evidence is clear that despite the US deporting 2,400 people per month for a drug offense, overdose deaths have risen,” said Perez Medina. “Our lawmakers must ensure that drug policy reforms prioritize public health policies to address the overdose crisis and problematic drug use. The exclusion and vilification of our immigrant neighbors is inhumane and fails to solve the issues our communities care about.”

The US Congress should reform immigration law to ensure immigrants with criminal convictions, including for drug offenses, are not subject to “one-size-fits-all” deportations. Instead, immigration judges should be given the discretion to make individualized decisions. As an important first step, Congress should impose a statute of limitations on deportations, so people can move beyond old offenses and get on with their lives.

States, meanwhile, should ensure that reforms to reduce criminal penalties for drug offenses and facilitate treatment and health services for those struggling with substance use are designed to allow non-citizens to benefit as well.

“Current and past administrations have recognized the disproportionate impact of harshly punitive drug policies on Black and Brown communities,” Gaubeca said. “But through their immigration policies, Congress and the executive branch are perpetuating these harms and devastating many of these same communities.”",HIGH,20240715T060000Z,Human Rights Watch and the Drug Policy Alliance,"Miguel Perez, Maritza Perez Medina, Vicki Gaubeca",US government,"United States, particularly states with large immigrant populations such as California, Illinois, New York, and Texas","Reform immigration law to allow discretion in deportation decisions, align federal law with state drug policy reforms",Deportation of immigrants for drug offenses that are legal under state laws,United States,Harsh federal immigration laws conflating drug offenses with deportable offenses

(Beirut) – Iranian authorities under the new president should halt their use of excessive and lethal force at the Iran-Iraq border against predominantly Kurdish kulbars (border couriers), who come from marginalized communities, Human Rights Watch and the Centre for Supporters of Human Rights (CSHR) said today.

Masoud Pezeshkian, the newly elected president of Iran, said during his presidential campaign in Sanandaj in June 2024: “It is shameful that our youth have to engage in kulbari [transporting goods across border] for a piece of bread. We must establish a border that facilitates trade, not kulbari.” Just three days after Pezeshkian’s election, five border couriers were shot at the border in Nowsud, in Kermanshah province, which led to the death of one of them, according to Kurdistan Human Rights Network.

“Marginalized Kurdish communities often turn to bringing goods over the border, legally or not, for lack of other economic opportunities,” said Nahid Naghshbandi, acting Iran researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Incoming President Pezeshkian should prioritize improving the state’s treatment of minorities, including the Kurdish border communities.”

On July 8, 2024, Human Rights Watch released an investigation into Iranian authorities’ serious violations against border couriers. On the same day, CSHR released a report that investigated the socioeconomic, legal, and human rights factors that shape the lives of Kurdish border couriers.

The research by CSHR and Human Rights Watch illustrates how Kurdish border couriers reflect broader systemic government failures in Iran’s underdeveloped border regions, the groups said. Driven by poverty, border couriers confront constant dangers from harsh terrain and lethal force used by Iranian security forces.

In June 2023, a member of the Iranian parliament’s National Security Commission announced the completion of a review of pending legislation, with proposed amendments that not only would broaden security forces’ ability to use firearms against border couriers but also the conditions under which they can do so. If passed into law, the amendments would put border couriers at even greater risk.

“Incoming President Pezeshkian should collaborate with the judiciary and legislative branches of the government to ensure that the pending legislation on the use of firearms prevents security forces from indiscriminately injuring and killing individuals, particularly at the border,” said Shabnam Moinipour, program director of CSHR. “It is essential that legal amendments be instituted to recognize and preserve the rights of kulbars, ensuring that perpetrators do not receive impunity.”

Iranian authorities’ use of excessive and lethal force against border couriers has had devastating consequences. Reports from the Kurdistan Press Agency (Kurdpa) state that in the first half of 2024, 33 Kurdish border couriers died and 254 were injured, including 14 children, most of them shot by security forces. Since 2011, Kurdpa has documented 2,463 deaths and injuries among couriers in Iranian Kurdish regions.

“When article 28 of the Iranian Constitution mandates the government to create jobs in all regions of Iran, it is unacceptable that this region has been neglected to the point where individuals, particularly men, must risk their lives to feed their families,” Moinipour said. “At the very least, these individuals should not be subjected to violence, driven by deeply rooted prejudice, from their fellow countryfolk.”

Many border couriers have been severely injured by landmines, including loss of limbs. While many landmines were placed in border areas during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war, some border couriers believe that Iranian security forces have used mines more recently along their routes. Iran is not among the 164 countries that have joined the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, which comprehensively prohibits antipersonnel landmines and requires mine clearance, stockpile destruction, and victim assistance. Injuries often lead to lost livelihoods.

Access to justice for border couriers remains limited, exacerbating their social and economic marginalization. Iran’s legal system prioritizes national security over individual rights, leaving the victims with little protection under the law. Efforts to seek justice are often thwarted by systemic biases, lack of transparency, and the broad discretionary powers granted to security forces. Without social or unemployment benefits in Iran, the injured cross-border couriers’ only hope is to be recognized as disabled veterans and receive disability benefits.

Iran should reassess its socioeconomic strategies for marginalized communities, including in predominantly Kurdish areas from where border couriers originate, and commit to upholding the rule of law. Measures should include stimulating economic growth in border areas, implementing labor protections, and ensuring robust social safety nets. Investment in education and vocational training is crucial to provide viable alternatives to high-risk jobs.

The United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials state that law enforcement officials shall not use firearms except in self-defense or defense of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury, to prevent a particularly serious crime involving grave threat to life, to arrest a person presenting such a danger and resisting their authority, or to prevent their escape, and only when less extreme means are insufficient. In any event, intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable to protect life.

The UN Fact-Finding Mission on Iran and the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran should monitor and report on the treatment of Kurdish border couriers in Iran.

“Incoming President Pezeshkian should work closely with Iran’s parliament to accede to the Mine Ban Treaty, facilitating Iran’s membership in this crucial international agreement,” Moinipour said. “By joining the treaty, Iran can demonstrate its commitment to protecting civilians, particularly in border regions where landmines pose a severe threat.”",HIGH,20240715T060000Z,Human Rights Watch and Centre for Supporters of Human Rights (CSHR),"Masoud Pezeshkian, Nahid Naghshbandi, Shabnam Moinipour",Iranian authorities,"Iran-Iraq border, Nowsud, Kermanshah province","Iran should reassess socioeconomic strategies, join the Mine Ban Treaty, and implement labor protections and social safety nets.",Excessive and lethal force against Kurdish border couriers (kulbars),Iran,"Poverty, lack of economic opportunities, systemic government failures"

The United States Supreme Court decision last month in Grants Pass v. Johnson gives local governments across the country the authority to ticket, arrest, and punish unhoused people for simply existing in public spaces. The ruling undermines the right to adequate housing in the US; it is also profoundly cruel and risks an increase in ineffective criminalization.

In its ruling, the Court overturned decisions by the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in this case and in Martin v. Boise, which limited punishment if there was no other place for a person legally to go or if there was no shelter available. The Court said that criminalizing a person for their unhoused status does not violate the prohibition on “cruel and unusual punishments” in the 8th amendment to the US Constitution.

The Supreme Court had previously held that authorities may not punish a person based solely on their status, as opposed to their conduct. The Grants Pass majority did not explicitly overrule that precedent, but said the 8th Amendment only applies to the form of punishment--not the outlawed conduct or status --and that state governments may choose to criminalize whatever they want without violating the Constitution. This ruling opens the door to further punishment of poverty and other statuses.

This decision gives local and state governments a green light to enact and enforce laws banning unhoused people from public spaces, regardless of whether adequate housing or shelter is available to them. States across the country, including Georgia, Texas, Florida and others, have already passed such laws. A recent study found that the majority of cities examined already had such laws in place.

In Los Angeles, previously limited by the 9th Circuit precedent, city councilmembers have already begun to explore options to further criminalize unhoused people in light of the Supreme Court decision. Other jurisdictions will likely race to take similar steps, not wanting to be the only areas in their region where unhoused people can safely stay.

Criminalization is not, as the majority opinion claims, a legitimate tool to combat houselessness as it subjects people to cruel treatment and arbitrary arrest, punishing them for simply existing in public space because they lack housing. Criminalization is also proven to be ineffective. It forces unhoused people to hide from view, separating them from helpful services. Criminalization causes suffering, but does nothing to house people. This ruling allows authorities to ignore real solutions, especially providing and preserving affordable housing, because they can simply chase unhoused people away with the threat of criminal enforcement.",HIGH,20240715T150000Z,Various human rights advocates and organizations,"US Supreme Court Justices, local government officials",United States Supreme Court,"Public spaces in various cities across the United States, including Los Angeles",Focus on providing adequate housing and eliminating criminalization of unhoused individuals.,Criminalizing unhoused individuals for existing in public spaces,United States,"Lack of adequate housing, systemic poverty"

Last week, the Congolese government’s Communication and Broadcasting Board (Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel et de la communication, CSAC) suspended journalist Jessy Kabasele for an indefinite period, following his interview with one of the country’s most famous singers, Koffi Olomide, on Le Panier The Morning Show. During the interview, aired by the state-run broadcasting company, Olomide criticized the army’s response to M23 rebels’ assault as too weak.

Congolese authorities have been fighting the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group since hostilities renewed in 2022 in the North Kivu province.

The CSAC accused Kabasele of failing to reframe Olomide’s speech which, it argued, “undermines the enormous efforts and sacrifices made by the government.” The media regulator summoned both Kabasele and Olomide last week, while Olomide’s lawyers are said to have met with a prosecutor on July 15.

Congo’s media regulator has been stifling reporting on the conflict. In February, the CSAC issued a directive requesting the media not to broadcast debates on Congolese army operations without the presence of at least one “expert on the matter.” It also requested journalists avoid radio phone-ins discussing the topic and interviewing “negative forces,” a vague and unclear term that leaves the door open to arbitrary prohibitions.

In April, the CSAC recommended that media outlets should no longer “broadcast information relating to the rebellion in eastern DRC without referring to official [government] sources.”

While international human rights law allows governments during states of emergency to derogate from some obligations to respect freedom of expression, there are strict standards on what governments can do and how. Those standards, which include restrictions having a clear legal basis, being necessary, and proportionate, ensure that the essence of freedom of expression, including freedom to seek, receive, and impart ideas and information, is safeguarded. CSAC’s inference with freedom of expression and freedom of the press fails to meet the criteria.

The cases of Olomide and Kabassele are reminiscent of other journalists and public figures who have been targeted by the authorities.

The work of Congolese journalists operating in eastern provinces has been fraught with danger and their dedication and commitment should be commended. Instead of punishing journalists and private citizens for expressing views on a crisis that is devastating the country, the authorities should protect journalists’ rights to operate safely and freely.",HIGH,20240717T144500Z,Congolese government’s Communication and Broadcasting Board (CSAC),"Jessy Kabasele, Koffi Olomide",Jessy Kabasele,"Goma, North Kivu province, Democratic Republic of Congo",Protect journalists' rights to operate safely and freely.,Failure to reframe criticism of the government's military response,Democratic Republic of Congo,Government efforts to control media narratives surrounding the conflict with M23 rebels

Hamas-led armed groups committed numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity against civilians during the October 7 assault on southern Israel.

and against civilians during the October 7 assault on southern Israel. Palestinian fighters committed summary killings, hostage-taking and other war crimes, and the crimes against humanity of murder and wrongful imprisonment.

Governments with influence over the Palestinian armed groups should press for the urgent release of all civilian hostages.

(Jerusalem) – Hamas’ military wing – the Qassam Brigades – and at least four other Palestinian armed groups committed numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity against civilians during the October 7, 2023 assault on southern Israel, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. Governments with influence over the armed groups should press for the urgent release of civilian hostages, an ongoing war crime, and for those responsible to be brought to justice.

The 236-page report, “‘I Can’t Erase All the Blood from My Mind’: Palestinian Armed Groups’ October 7 Assault on Israel,” documents several dozen cases of serious violations of international humanitarian law by Palestinian armed groups at nearly all the civilian attack sites on October 7. These include the war crimes and crimes against humanity of murder, hostage-taking, and other grave offenses. Human Rights Watch also examined the role of various armed groups and their coordination before and during the attacks. Previous Human Rights Watch reports have addressed numerous serious violations by Israeli forces in Gaza since October 7.

“Human Rights Watch research found that the Hamas-led assault on October 7 was designed to kill civilians and take as many people as possible hostage,” said Ida Sawyer, crisis and conflict director at Human Rights Watch. “The October 7 atrocities should spur a global call to action for an end to all abuses against civilians in Israel and Palestine.”

Between October 2023 and June 2024, Human Rights Watch interviewed 144 people including 94 Israeli and other nationals who witnessed the October 7 assault, victims’ family members, first responders, and medical experts. Researchers also verified and analyzed over 280 photographs and videos taken during the assault and posted on social media or shared directly with Human Rights Watch.

Time Will Tell: How Human Rights Watch Identifies Time Through Analyzing Videos For the past nine months, Human Rights Watch has continued to document ongoing atrocity crimes and human rights violations in Palestine and Israel. For this report, we analyzed over 280 videos and photographs that, combined with witness accounts, helped to identify exactly what happened on October 7, where and when and to whom, as well as who was responsible. The purpose of this research was to bring facts to light and support accountability efforts by documenting the abuses committed on October 7 and identifying those responsible.

On the morning of October 7, Hamas-led Palestinian armed groups carried out numerous coordinated attacks including on civilian residential communities and social events and on Israeli military bases in the area of southern Israel bordering the Gaza Strip. The armed groups attacked at least 19 kibbutzim and 5 moshavim (cooperative communities), the cities of Sderot and Ofakim, 2 music festivals, and a beach party. The fighting lasted much of the day and in some cases longer.

Across many attack sites, Palestinian fighters fired directly at civilians, often at close range, as they tried to flee, and at people driving through the area. The attackers hurled grenades, shot into shelters, and fired rocket-propelled grenades at homes. They set houses on fire, burning and choking people, and forcing out others whom they shot or captured. They took dozens hostage and summarily killed others.

Nirit Hunwald, a nurse from Kibbutz Be’eri, where 97 civilians were killed, described dragging a rapid response team member who had been shot into the kibbutz’s dental clinic to treat his wounds: “There was a blood trail. I cannot erase it from my mind, all the blood.”

Agence France-Presse cross-referenced numerous data sources to determine that 815 of 1,195 people killed on October 7 were civilians. The armed groups took as hostages 251 civilians and Israeli security force personnel and took them to Gaza. As of July 1, 116 remained in Gaza, including the bodies of at least 42 who had been killed, according to AFP. Bodies of another 35 who were killed were returned to Israel.

The Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, the Palestinian movement that has governed the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip since 2007, led the assault. Human Rights Watch confirmed the participation of four other Palestinian armed groups based on headbands the fighters wore to indicate their affiliation and their claims of responsibility posted to their Telegram channels on social media.

The armed groups committed numerous violations of the laws of war that amount to war crimes, including attacks targeting civilians and civilian objects; willful killing of people in custody; cruel and other inhumane treatment; crimes involving sexual and gender-based violence; hostage-taking; mutilation and despoiling bodies; use of human shields; and pillage and looting.

The widespread attack was directed against a civilian population. Killing civilians and taking hostages were central aims of the planned attack, not an afterthought, a plan gone awry, or isolated acts. Human Rights Watch concluded that the planned murder of civilians and the hostage-taking were crimes against humanity.

Further investigation is needed into other potential crimes against humanity, Human Rights Watch said, including persecution against any identifiable group on racial, national, ethnic or religious grounds; rape or other sexual violence of comparable gravity; and extermination, if there was a mass killing calculated to bring about the “destruction” of part of a population. These would amount to crimes against humanity if the crimes were part of the attack against a civilian population, under an organizational policy to commit such an attack.

Questions and Answers: The Hamas-Led Armed Groups' October 7, 2023 Assault on Israel Human Rights Watch research found that Palestinian armed groups involved in the assault on Israel on October 7, 2023, committed numerous violations of international humanitarian law – also known as the laws of war – that amount to war crimes.

Hamas authorities responded to questions from Human Rights Watch, stating that its forces were instructed not to target civilians and to abide by international human rights and humanitarian law. In many cases, Human Rights Watch investigations found evidence to the contrary.

Accounts from survivors along with verified photographs and videos show Palestinian fighters seeking out civilians and killing them across the attack sites from the moment the assault began, indicating that the intentional killing and hostage-taking of civilians was planned and highly coordinated.

Within days of the attacks, Israeli authorities cut off essential services to Gaza’s population and blocked the entry of all but a trickle of fuel and humanitarian aid, amounting to collective punishment – which is a war crime – exacerbating the impact of Israel’s more than 17-year illegal closure of Gaza and its crimes of apartheid and persecution against Palestinians.

Immediately after the attacks in southern Israel, Israeli forces began an intense aerial bombardment and later a ground incursion, which are ongoing. More than 37,900 Palestinians, most of them civilians, were killed between October 7 and July 1, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. Israeli forces have reduced large parts of Gaza to rubble and left the vast majority of Gaza’s population displaced and in harm’s way.

All parties to the armed conflict in Gaza and Israel should fully abide by international humanitarian law. The Palestinian armed groups in Gaza should immediately and unconditionally release civilians held hostage. They should take appropriate disciplinary measures against members responsible for war crimes and should surrender for prosecution anyone facing an International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant.

“Atrocities do not justify atrocities,” Sawyer said. “To stop the endless cycle of abuses in Israel and Palestine, it’s critical to address root causes and hold violators of grave crimes to account. That’s in the interests of both Palestinians and Israelis.”",VERY HIGH,20240717T051500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Ida Sawyer, Nirit Hunwald",Hamas-led armed groups,"Southern Israel, including Kibbutz Be'eri, Sderot, Ofakim","End hostilities, release of hostages, accountability for war crimes.",War crimes and crimes against humanity against civilians,Israel,"Ongoing conflict, history of violence"

(Beirut) – Iran’s Revolutionary Court has sentenced a labor activist to death on a charge of “armed rebellion against the state,” based on an allegation of membership in an opposition group, Human Rights Watch said today. The court on July 4, 2024, communicated the verdict against Sharifeh Mohammedi to her husband, Sirous Fathi, Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) reported.

HRANA reported on July 4, that intelligence agents arrested Mohammadi at her home in Rasht on December 5, 2023. A source close to Mohammadi’s family told HRANA that she had been a member of the Association of Labor Organizations until 2013. This group has no connection to Komala, a Kurdish social democratic party that had previously engaged in armed conflict in Iran and reportedly still maintains an armed wing, to which she was accused of belonging.

“Iranian authorities’ not only relentlessly target women activists, but they carry out additional attacks and repression on women from ethnic and religious minorities, said Nahid Naghshbandi, acting Iran researcher at Human Rights Watch. “If incoming President Pezeshkian wants to signal that he represents real change, he should start by halting this ongoing repression, including death sentences.”

Mohammadi was born in East Azerbaijan and was a member of the Coordination Committee to Help Form Workers’ Organizations. The committee was founded in 2005 by several Kurdish activists to assist and facilitate the creation of independent labor organizations. Iran’s security agencies considered this committee to be affiliated with the Komala group without evidence. Although the founders and members of this committee have been arrested and imprisoned multiple times, none of them have been accused of “armed rebellion against the state.”

Sixteen women political prisoners from Evin prison wrote in a letter on July 9, that they “stand alongside Sharifeh Mohammadi and all those threatened by the death penalty.” The letter stated that “Sharifeh Mohammadi, a labor activist, was sentenced to death after seven months of detention, torture, and interrogation based on baseless accusations.” The Nobel Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi was among the signatories.

Since the 2022 “Woman, Life, Freedom” protests, Iranian authorities have intensified their crackdown on women activists and human rights defenders, employing harsher measures and issuing severe sentences to suppress dissent and silence opposition voices. This includes sentencing 11 women's rights and political activists to prison terms on March 27.

The targeting of ethnic and religious minorities is apparent in state crackdowns in regions like Kurdistan and Sistan and Baluchistan. Two other Kurdish women political activists, Pakhshan Azizi and Warisha Moradi, are on trial in Tehran on charges of “armed rebellion against the state.”

The Kurdistan Human Rights Network (KHRN) reported that intelligence agents arrested Moradi, a member of the East Kurdistan Free Woman Society (KJAR) on August 1, 2023, in Kermanshah. She is also accused of “armed rebellion against the state.”

KHRN said that she faced pressure and threats to make forced confessions. On December 26, 2023, after five months in solitary confinement, she was moved to the women's ward of Evin prison. She continues to be denied her right to make phone calls and meet with her family.

KHRN said that intelligence agents arrested Azizi on August 4, 2023, also on charges of “armed rebellion against the state.” She was previously arrested by security forces in 2009 during a protest gathering of Kurdish students at the University of Tehran against political executions in Kurdistan. She was released on bail after being detained for four months. Several members of her family were also detained but released after a few days of interrogation. She has not been allowed to see a lawyer and has faced threats and pressure to confess, according to KHRN.

Jina Modares Gorji, a journalist and women's rights activist from Sanandaj, was sentenced to 21 years in prison and exile by the Revolutionary Court in Sanandaj in May 2024. She faced charges of “forming illegal groups with the aim of overthrowing the state,” “collaborating with hostile groups and governments,” and “propaganda against the state.”

“Iranian authorities have demonstrated their disregard for minority and women's rights through the brutal repression of protests and arrests and mistreatment of women’s activists,” Naghshbandi said. “They should release Sharifeh Mohammadi without delay.”",VERY HIGH,20240718T091500Z,Iranian authorities,"Sharifeh Mohammadi, Sirous Fathi, Nahid Naghshbandi",Sharifeh Mohammadi,"Rasht, Iran; Evin prison; Kermanshah; Sanandaj","Release Sharifeh Mohammadi and other activists, halt repression of dissent",armed rebellion against the state,Iran,"Political repression, targeting of dissent, historical marginalization of ethnic minorities"

Since Egypt’s last Universal Periodic Review (UPR) in 2019, Egyptian authorities continued to systematically detain and punish peaceful critics, while activists and security agencies continued to torture and hold detained dissidents in incommunicado detention for long periods. Egyptian authorities have failed to uphold and fulfill many aspects of Egyptians’ economic rights amid recurring economic crises and severe inflation.

Freedom of Association and Attacks on Human Rights Defenders

In its 2019 UPR, Egypt accepted recommendations on the right to freedom of association. Civic space has remained severely curtailed, however, as independent organizations operating under draconian laws have faced continued judicial and security harassment.

In January 2021, the government issued implementing regulations for the 2019 NGO Law, following which existing nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) faced a deadline to register by April 2023 or be dissolved.[1] Even if an organization is able to register successfully, the law allows the government to intervene in or restrict a groups’ day to day activities and prohibit a wide range of other activities such as conducting opinion polls without government approval.[2] The law prohibits other activities under vaguely worded terms such as “political” work or any work that undermines “national security.” The new law also prohibits collaboration with foreign NGOs or experts, imposes a strict system of prior approval for foreign organizations to work in the country, and allows for government surveillance and monitoring of organizations’ activities.[3]

Authorities also used other laws such as the 2015 counterterrorism law and the 2014 terrorist entities law to detain and punish human rights defenders and civil society activists. This includes the detention of Gasser Abdel Razek and two of his colleagues with the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights in November 2020 and the March 2023 harsh sentencing of the director of the Egyptian Center for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) and others in retaliation for peaceful human rights work.[4]

Authorities continued to target some of the most prominent human rights organizations and defenders in the protracted investigations of Case 173 of 2011, in which the authorities prosecuted dozens for receiving foreign funds. In this and other cases, authorities used arbitrary travel bans to target key members of civil society for their peaceful work, including rights lawyers, journalists, feminists, and researchers.[5] Beginning in 2022, authorities gradually lifted travel bans against many human rights defenders. In March 2024, authorities announced the closure of the infamous Case 173. However, several of the activists involved still face asset freezes and terrorism charges.[6]

Recommendations:

Release and drop charges against all those detained for peacefully exercising their right to freedom of association, including those detained solely for actual or perceived links to political parties or groups.

Repeal Law No. 10 of 1914 which limits the right to peaceful assembly.

Repeal or rigorously amend Law No. 107 of 2013 which restricts freedom of assembly, to bring it in line with international human rights standards.

Repeal the repressive 2019 NGO Law and remove restrictions on the work of civil society groups. Work with independent human rights organizations to adopt a new legislative framework upholding the right to freedom of association in accordance with international human rights standards.

Lift arbitrary asset freezes and travel bans against members of civil society for their peaceful work, including rights lawyers, journalists, feminists, and researchers.

Facilitate without further delay visits requested by the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of peaceful assembly and of association and the Special Rapporteur on counter-terrorism and human rights.

Abuses by Security Forces

Egypt failed to implement the 2019 UPR recommendations to prosecute and punish possible crimes committed by security officers and to ensure all detained persons are protected by law against torture and all other ill-treatment.

Interior Ministry police and National Security agents continued to forcibly disappear or hold incommunicado critics and dissidents in official and unofficial detention places, where authorities frequently subjected them to torture and forced them to confess. Perpetrators have enjoyed near-absolute impunity.[7]

The government also failed to amend the definition of torture in the penal code to meet its obligations under the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment to properly define and penalize torture.

Prison conditions remained dire with widespread and systematic abuses, including in the newly built prisons that the government has highlighted in public relations campaigns to whitewash its abuses.[8] The ban on visits by family members and lawyers and the denial of adequate medical care to prisoners remained pervasive.[9]

In April 2023, prosecutors refused a request by the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression to reopen an investigation into the ill-treatment and suspicious death in custody of Egyptian economist Ayman Hadhoud.[10]

In 2023, Human Rights Watch and the Egyptian rights group Sinai Foundation for Human Rights documented Egyptian security forces’ arbitrary detention and abuse of women and girls between 2017 and 2022, all of whom were related to suspected members of Wilayat Sina’ in North Sinai, the local affiliate of Islamic State (ISIS).[11]

In a 2021 report, HRW documented security forces killing of dozens of dissidents and suspects in apparent extrajudicial executions that authorities disguised as “shootouts.” Evidence gathered demonstrates that many of those killed were being held in secret detention at the time.[12]

Recommendations:

Ensure that all those detained are protected from torture or other ill-treatment, and that detention conditions meet international human rights standards.

Ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.

Ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance .

. Establish torture-prevention mechanisms including by allowing independent oversight over all places of detention.

Ensure that investigations into human rights violations are impartial, independent, and effective. The Justice Ministry should appoint a commission composed of law professors, legal experts, human rights activists, and prosecutors with concrete powers to transparently and openly initiate criminal investigations into torture and disappearances.

Bring the crimes of torture and enforced disappearance in national law into conformity with the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.

Ensure security forces act in accordance with international human rights law and standards on the use of force, including the UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials.

Allow regular visits by family and lawyers to detainees.

Refugee , Asylum Seeker , and Migrant Rights

Human Rights Watch and other organizations have documented serious abuses against migrants, asylum seekers, and refugees by Egyptian authorities. These include arbitrary detentions in poor conditions in police stations, forced labor and physical abuse in some cases during or following raids to check residency permits; and summary deportations or expulsions of asylum seekers to countries where they faced credible risk of persecution, torture, or other serious human rights abuses—in violation of the principle of nonrefoulement under international law.[13]

Official numbers show that sexual and gender-based violence is a pervasive problem for Egypt’s refugee communities.[14] In 2021, UNHCR said it provided gender-based violence response services to more than 2,300 registered refugees.[15] During October 2019 alone, the agency received reports of 85 rapes and 30 other sexual assaults, 18 physical assaults, and six cases of psychological abuse.[16] Human Rights Watch documented in 2022 how refugees and asylum seekers who are survivors of abuses, including sexual and gender-based violence, faced barriers to reporting abuse to the police and to accessing medical assistance. The authorities failed to provide them with protection and access to justice, as police refused to register survivors’ complaints or pursue investigations.[17]

In June 2023, following the outbreak of conflict in Sudan, the Egyptian government imposed a visa requirement for all Sudanese citizens entering Egypt. The decision made it more difficult for those previously exempted from visa requirements to flee the conflict, including women, children, and older people.[18]

Authorities have repeatedly deported large numbers African asylum seekers, including Sudanese and Eritreans, without adequate assessment of their refugee claims—against the principle of non-refoulement.

Recommendations:

Open an independent investigation into the failure of the police to investigate sexual violence against vulnerable refugees, asylum seekers, and migrants—particularly black African women and girls.

Ensure that migrant and refugee survivors of sexual violence have access to police and medical assistance.

End all arbitrary arrests and physical abuse by the Egyptian security forces of refugees, asylum seekers, and migrants.

End unlawful expulsions and deportations of refugees and asylum seekers, in accordance with the principle of nonrefoulement. Ensure all individuals facing deportation are able to challenge their deportations before an independent court.

Combat racist views against migrants and promote awareness of the positive contribution of refugees to society.

Cease harassment and persecution—including through defamation campaigns and threats—of refugee activists exercising their right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.

Gender-based Discrimination and LGBT Rights

Though Egypt accepted the 2019 UPR recommendation to take “measures to eliminate discrimination against women,” Egyptian women continued to face discrimination under Egypt’s personal status law on equal access to divorce, child custody, and inheritance. A Human Rights Watch report released in July 2023 found that male guardianship policies continued to hinder women’s travel and mobility.[19] For instance, Egypt’s Personal Status Law provides that a woman can be deemed disobedient by a court and lose the right to spousal maintenance (nafaqa) from her husband if she leaves the marital home or works without her husband’s consent, with some exceptions.

The law deems fathers, but not mothers, guardians of their children.[20] Though children need just one parent’s approval to obtain a passport,[21] the authorities in practice sometimes require the consent of the father as the “natural guardian.”[22]

Egypt also accepted the 2019 UPR recommendation to adopt legislation to “criminalize all forms of violence against women,” yet no law was issued to combat domestic violence—including to prevent abuse, protect survivors, and prosecute abusers. Sexual harassment and sexual violence remain a pervasive problem in Cairo and other cities.[23]

Authorities in recent years have relentlessly prosecuted women social media influencers on vague charges such as violating “public morals” and “undermining family values.”[24] For example, in April 2023, a court sentenced the Egyptian model and influencer Salma al-Shimy to two years in prison and an EGP 100,000 (about US$3,237) fine for publishing videos deemed “sexually provocative.”[25]

Egypt does not explicitly criminalize same-sex relations. However, several Egyptian laws restrict the rights to freedom of expression and privacy. Egyptian security agencies have waged a relentless campaign of repression against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people and activists, one of the worst in Egypt in recent decades. Security officers arbitrarily arrest people in public places based on their gender expression, and detain them in inhuman conditions, systematically subjecting them to ill-treatment including torture.[26] In addition, security forces entrap LGBT people through dating apps and other pervasive online targeting.[27]

Recommendations:

Take measures to eliminate discrimination against women under Egypt’s personal status law and grant equal rights in the areas of divorce, child custody, and inheritance.

Stop prosecuting women social media influencers on ill-defined morality charges.

End all persecution of people based on their suspected same-sex conduct or sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

Investigate and hold accountable individuals making online or offline statements that incite or threaten violence against LGBT people.

Death Penalty and Unfair Trials

Egypt did not accept its 2019 UPR recommendation on death sentences and courts continue to issue death sentences for a wide range of crimes. These include cases of alleged political violence and terrorism, in which defendants’ claims of forced disappearance and torture almost always went uninvestigated by judges.

According to the Egyptian Front for Human Rights, during the first half of 2020 Egyptian military and civilian courts issued 171 death sentences and upheld the sentences of 10 others, including seven in a case of alleged political violence.[28] From January to late October 2020, authorities executed at least 83 persons, 25 of whom were charged in cases involving alleged political violence, according to numbers compiled by Human Rights Watch and the Egyptian Front for Human Rights.”[29] EFHR also reported that Egyptian civilian criminal courts issued death sentences against at least 348 individuals in about 222 cases.[30]

Egypt remains in the top ten countries in the world in number of executions and death sentences according to Amnesty International.[31]

Since its 2019 UPR, Egypt also failed to implement recommendation to ensure “fair, equitable and independent judicial procedures.” Since 20217, Egyptian authorities have used Emergency State Security Courts to prosecute dissidents and political opponents. Even after the removal of the state of emergency in 2021, the courts are proceeding with existing cases.[32]

Authorities continued to prosecute civilians before military courts in a wide range of cases. In 2024, parliament approved amendments (Law No. 3 of 2024 and amendments to Law No. 25 of 1966) that entrench and widen the already broad powers of the military over civilian life in a manner that undermines basic rights. [33]

Recommendations:

Repeal all laws that permit subjecting civilians for trial in military trials, and end ongoing military trials of civilians.

Halt ongoing trials in Emergency State Security Courts and amend laws to fully abolish them.

Ensure that all those detained on recognizably criminal charges are tried in proceedings that fully conform with international fair trial guarantees, without recourse to the death penalty.

Issue a moratorium on the death penalty as a matter of priority.

Open investigations into allegations that evidence obtained under torture was used in convictions and death sentences

Conflict in North Sinai

In April 2022, President al-Sisi announced an end to ongoing military operations in North Sinai against the local extremist armed group Islamic State (also known as ISIS) affiliate Wilayat Sina.[34] But in July and August, videos and photographs circulated on social media by groups representing army-affiliated militias showed three extrajudicial executions of shackled or wounded men in custody in North Sinai.[35]

The Egyptian army has conducted a massive demolitions campaign that included destroying over 12,300 buildings in North Sinai from 2013 to July 2020, without upholding its human rights obligations on forced evictions. Many of these demolitions lacked evidence of “absolute” military necessity, likely making them war crimes. Hundreds of families remain uncompensated.[36]

Recommendations:

Halt abusive home demolitions and forced evictions in North Sinai.

Fairly and fully compensate all families evicted from their homes, land, and farms and those who lost sources of income. Allow recourse through independent judicial review.

Make public information regarding compensation issued for families affected and the time frame for when those displaced will be allowed to return to their homes.

Social and Economic Rights

The authorities failed to implement the accepted 2019 UPR recommendation by taking adequate steps to mitigate the impact of the economic crisis on people’s rights.

Nearly one-third of Egyptians were in poverty in 2019, a percentage which has almost certainly increased since then due the economic crisis. Inflation, which hit a 40 percent record in late 2023, has further undermined people’s rights, particularly to food.[37]

The government has failed to reach constitutionally mandated levels of spending on the health and education sectors. Although it has expanded its social security system from four to five million households, this still excludes millions of households in or near poverty and the benefit amounts have been significantly eroded due to inflation.

With very little civic, judicial, or parliamentary scrutiny, the authorities have faced virtually no accountability for regressive policies, pervasive corruption, and poor governance.

Recommendations:

Expand social security to a universal system and increase benefits to adequate levels.

Update: On July 19, the UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced to the House of Commons that “I can confirm to the House that we are overturning the suspension of UNRWA funding. Britain will provide £21 million in new funds.” Lammy added “we are reassured that UNRWA is ensuring that it meets the highest standards of neutrality and is strengthening its procedures, including on vetting.” With the UK’s decision to restore its financial support to UNRWA, the United States government remains the lone holdout on aid suspension.

(New York) – The governments of the United States and the United Kingdom have yet to restore critical funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), Human Rights Watch said. Both governments should act immediately to reinstate their support to the agency, the largest relief organization in Gaza.

On July 12, 2024, the US and UK endorsed a set of shared commitments alongside 116 other governments acknowledging the “extremely critical financial situation” facing UNRWA and “recognizing the serious humanitarian, political and security risks that would result from any interruption or suspension of its vital work.” But neither country has reversed its January decision to cut off funds.

“The US and UK are now shameful outliers as most donors have resumed funding UNRWA,” said Akshaya Kumar, crisis advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. “Cutting off aid was disproportionate to the allegations against UNRWA from the start. Palestinians in Gaza are facing catastrophic food insecurity, massive shortages of medical supplies, and repeated displacement, and there’s no substitute for UNRWA’s networks, experience, and capacity to provide relief.”

The aid cutoffs were based on Israeli authorities’ allegations that 19 people, out of UNRWA’s 30,000 staff, had participated in the October 7 attack in Israel, which Human Rights Watch found included war crimes and crimes against humanity. An independent review released on April 20 and a published update on ongoing inquires by the UN’s own internal investigators both stated that they have not found evidence, or been supplied the evidence by Israeli authorities, to support the key allegations.

Ninety percent of Gaza’s population have been displaced or forced to flee their homes, many repeatedly, and 96 percent are projected to face crisis or worse levels of food insecurity by September.

According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, pregnant women in Gaza are finding it increasingly challenging to access the lifesaving care they need, and some emergency deliveries are taking place in tents without medical support. Comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care are available at only 11 facilities, where dire fuel shortages are hampering the functioning of incubators and other equipment.

In a July 14 statement, an UNRWA official described the conditions at Nasser hospital, where “many patients were treated on the ground without disinfectants,” there were “not enough beds, hygiene equipment, sheeting, or scrubs,” and he saw “toddlers who are double amputees, children paralyzed and unable to receive treatment, and others separated from their parents.”

UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini told a pledging conference at the UN that UNRWA still faces a financial crisis and “the Agency’s ability to operate beyond September depends on Member States disbursing planned funding and making new contributions to the core budget.” UNRWA relies primarily on donations from individual governments to fund its work in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Gaza, and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Contributions by governments to UNRWA are voluntary and discretionary.

In January, UNRWA immediately terminated the contracts of 10 of the staff members allegedly involved in the October 7 assault. Two others had died by the time accusations were made public. The UN’s internal investigator, the Office of Internal Oversight Services, opened investigations into all 12 UNRWA staff members initially identified and later added 7 more, but subsequently suspended inquires in 4 cases for insufficient evidence and closed one case because Israel had not provided any supporting evidence. Inquiries into the other cases are ongoing.

Separately, the UN secretary-general appointed an independent panel headed by former French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna to assess UNRWA’s neutrality. The panel publicly released its own report with 50 recommendations in April, and UNRWA has since set up an internal task force to oversee implementation of the recommendations.

In response to Israel’s allegations in January, UNRWA said 16 countries suspended their donations to the agency and others indicated they would set conditions on further funding. The vast majority, including Australia, Austria, Canada, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and Sweden, have since resumed payments.

Other donors, including France, Denmark, Switzerland, New Zealand, and the European Union, never suspended donations and instead released funds they had previously planned to give to the UNRWA over time, keeping some remainder in tranches subject to certain conditions. The Netherlands had already disbursed its annual contribution to UNRWA before the allegations emerged in January but announced it would pause further funding. In June, the Netherlands earmarked and indicated willingness to release further funding as UNRWA implements the independent panel’s recommendations.

In early March, UNRWA provided the EU with “written confirmation” that it would “deliver on agreed conditions and measures,” including an audit, strengthened internal controls, and screening and vetting of staff.

Governments including Belgium, Ireland, Luxembourg, Norway, and Slovenia never cut off or slowed funding and called on others to keep funds flowing, while others like Iraq, Qatar, and Spain increased their donations as the humanitarian situation in Gaza worsened.

Historically, the US has been the largest donor to UNRWA, accounting for a third of the agency’s budget in 2023. After the Biden administration announced in late January that it was pausing payments, Congress passed a law prohibiting any further funding to UNRWA until at least March 2025. Officials in the Biden administration told Human Rights Watch it diverted the funds intended for UNRWA to other aid agencies for use in Gaza.

The UK’s newly elected Labour government has yet to announce a change in policy, leaving the previous government’s UNRWA suspension in place. While in opposition, David Lammy, now the foreign secretary, and other senior Labour party members publicly criticized the Conservative government for its January decision to cut aid to UNRWA and urged it to restore funding. Lammy indicated on July 15 that he would make a statement to parliament in the “coming days” on UNRWA.

Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA commissioner-general, said that the agency has also faced a sustained campaign of reputational, legal, and physical attacks by Israeli authorities. On January 31, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a delegation of UN ambassadors that “UNRWA’s mission has to end,” while Foreign Minister Israel Katz has made clear his intention that UNRWA will “not be part of the day after.” In February, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich blocked the delivery of a US funded shipment of flour to UNRWA, forcing the delivery through the World Food Programme instead.

Israeli authorities are also seeking to rescind the tax exemptions UNRWA receives and have made moves to shut down UNRWA’s offices located on Israeli state property, limit the length of visas for international UNRWA staff, and refuse visas to staff.

Human Rights Watch has documented two strikes that hit UNRWA aid workers who had communicated their precise GPS coordinates to Israel for their presumed protection, one on a guest house in December 2023 and the other on a convoy in February 2024.

“By continuing to withhold funds, the US and UK are exacerbating the effects of the Israeli government’s campaign against UNRWA and the people who depend on the agency,” Kumar said. “These governments say they’re concerned about the starving people of Gaza, but they’re starving the agency best placed to feed them.”",HIGH,20240719T004500Z,Israeli authorities,"Akshaya Kumar, Philippe Lazzarini, David Lammy",United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA),UNRWA facilities in Gaza,Immediate reinstatement of funding to UNRWA by US and UK,Involvement of UNRWA staff in attacks against Israel,Gaza,"Allegations made by Israeli authorities, historical conflict between Israel and Palestine"

(Jakarta) – The Indonesian police and military should investigate the deadly arson attack against a journalist and three members of his family in Kabanjahe, a small town in North Sumatra, Human Rights Watch said today. While three men have been arrested, the authorities should also question other possible conspirators.

Rico Sempurna Pasaribu, 47, of the Medan-based Tribata TV, and his family were found dead inside their small wooden house in Kabanjahe on June 27, 2024. The dead included his wife, Elparida Ginting, 48, his daughter, Sudi Investi Pasaribu, 12, and a 3-year-old grandson Louin Arlando Situngkir, for whom the Pasaribus were babysitting that night. The eldest daughter, Eva Meliani Pasaribu, 22, whose young son died in the fire, is now campaigning for justice.

“Indonesian police should conduct a credible and timebound inquiry to identify everyone involved in the attack, including any military personnel,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The military should cooperate with the police to ensure that any army officer involved in gambling and arson is properly prosecuted.”

On June 22, Tribata TV published on its website Pasaribu’s story, “Gambling Location on Captain Bom Ginting Street Turns Out to Belong to an Army Officer with the Rank of Corporal, Member of the 125th Battalion.” The report included a picture of a house, allegedly the office of the illegal online gambling business, citing its proximity to the barracks of the Army 125th battalion in Kabanjahe.

While the story did not have a byline, Pasaribu posted a link on his Facebook page, stating that the gambling was controlled by an army officer he named.

After the report was published, the soldier allegedly threatened Pasaribu, according to the Medan-based Journalist Safety Committee, which published the first report on the arson attack. The soldier also asked Tribata TV’s chief editor Edrin Adriansyah to take down the report, according to Adriansyah and the committee. Both declined to take down the report.

The Journalist Safety Committee is a coalition of organizations, including the Alliance of Independent Journalists and the Medan Legal Aid Institute. Medan is the capital of North Sumatra province. Pasaribu had reported that the soldier had threatened him, according to some of his journalist colleagues, and, the committee said, had decided to stay away from his house for a few days fearing an attack.

Bayu Wardhana, secretary-general of the Alliance of Independent Journalists, said they feared a cover-up. “The case requires special attention due to suspicions of military involvement,” he said. “Rico had reported on online gambling activities allegedly backed by military members shortly before his death.”

An army spokesperson said that the authorities had questioned the soldier named in the report but found that he was not involved in gambling. The Indonesian military has a long history of protecting its soldiers from prosecution for human rights violations, Human Rights Watch said.

Gambling is a rampant social problem in Kabanjahe, the capital of the Karo regency. On June 26, several religious organizations staged a protest outside the 125th battalion headquarters, demanding that they stop the gambling business.

Pasaribu came out of hiding to cover the protest, publishing the story on Tribata TV’s website. He also posted some photos on his Facebook page. He then returned to his house.

The attack occurred at 3:40 a.m. on June 27, based on CCTV footage. The North Sumatra police have arrested three suspects: Yunus Saputra Tarigan, also known as Selewang, Rudi Apri Sembiring, and Bebas Ginting. The wooden house was part of a shop where Pasaribu’s wife sold snacks, cigarettes, and kerosene, and it burned rapidly, the police and the committee stated.

The police said that they had questioned 28 witnesses. Ginting, 62, one of those arrested, is the former head of the Angkatan Muda Pembaharuan Indonesia (AMPI), a youth organization linked to the Golkar Party, one of the largest political parties in Indonesia, which had official ties to the Indonesian military during President Soeharto’s three decades in power.

Indonesian authorities have failed to arrest suspects in killings of journalists over the last three decades, including the 1996 murder of Fuad Muhammad Syafruddin, who had published several news reports on corruption in the Bantul regency in the months before his death.

In 1999, Sander Thoenes, a Dutch journalist who worked for the Financial Times, was killed in Becora, outside Dili, East Timor, by Indonesian soldiers of the Army’s Battalion 745. The case was eventually dropped after Major Jacob Djoko Sarosa, the battalion commander, who was indicted by an Indonesian human rights committee over the killing, never responded to a summons.

“The grotesque killing of Sempurna Pasaribu and his family should serve as warning to Indonesian authorities that political protection emboldens criminals, including to punish journalists and whistleblowers,” Ganguly said. “Soldiers who engage in corruption, extortion, threats, or killings should know that they have no place in the army, and instead belong in jail.”",VERY HIGH,20240719T091500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Eva Meliani Pasaribu, Meenakshi Ganguly, Edrin Adriansyah, Bayu Wardhana",Indonesian police and military,"Kabanjahe, North Sumatra, Indonesia","Investigate all parties involved, ensure accountability for military personnel, protect journalists from threats.","Failure to investigate the arson attack on journalist Rico Sempurna Pasaribu and his family, potential military involvement in gambling and arson.",Indonesia,"Corruption, military influence in illegal gambling, lack of accountability for human rights violations"

(Beirut) – Forces linked with the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC), which governs the southern Yemen city of Aden, seized an independent women’s shelter on May 26, 2024, Human Rights Watch said today. The STC and its affiliated Southern Women’s Union threatened the independent Yemen Women’s Union staff and women sheltering there. Yemeni Archive also released an investigation today with similar findings.

“While the Southern Transitional Council rhetorically supports women’s rights, its actions have repeatedly shown that it is restricting civil society, including those working to support women,” said Niku Jafarnia, Yemen and Bahrain researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The Southern Transitional Council should take immediate measures to remove the Southern Women’s Union from the premises of the Yemen Women’s Union, which is one of the few safe spaces that women fleeing abuse can rely on.”

The raid is the latest in a series of STC actions that seek to replace independent institutions with entities it supports. The STC should cease its violations of women’s rights as well as its broader attacks on civil society.

The Yemen Women’s Union is one of the oldest civil society organizations dedicated to serving Yemeni women. It operates shelters throughout the country for survivors of gender-based violence, including women and children. The shelters provide mental, legal, social and economic support for the women. It is a vital resource, particularly in a country in which the law still restricts women’s freedoms, Human Rights Watch said.

For nearly a month, the attackers maintained full control over the Yemen Women’s Union offices and shelter in Aden. They prevented staff from caring for a sick boy in the shelter, and only allowed the Yemen Women’s Union staff to bring those in the shelter some limited food supplies, placing women and children in the shelter at risk. Though the staff were able to re-enter their offices on June 23, the STC demanded that they provide half of the building space to the government-affiliated Southern Women’s Union and remove the word “Yemen” from their name to signify that they only support women in Yemen’s south.

Human Rights Watch interviewed six people, including lawyers and others who are aware of the raid, and verified videos and photographs sent directly to researchers and found on social media platforms showing the raid. Human Rights Watch also reviewed official documents relevant to the seizure.

The STC is part of the internationally recognized Yemeni government’s coalition: the eight-member Presidential Leadership Council, which replaced former President Abdo Rabbu Mansour Hadi in 2022, and includes STC leaders. The STC, on its own, also maintains significant control in Aden as well as in several other governorates in southern Yemen.

Human Rights Watch asked the STC for comment. They replied on June 6 stating that the Southern Women’s Union is an independent organization, and that STC forces were not in control of the building. They added that if STC forces were there, it would be to secure the building as (is the case) with others. They also provided Human Rights Watch with a document from the Social Affairs Ministry stating that the Southern Women’s Union, which was established on January 6, 2024, during a women’s conference in Aden, is the official women’s union recognized by the Yemeni government. However, while the STC established this new women’s union, it rejected renewing the registration of the independent Yemen Women’s Union.

People interviewed said that the STC began harassing the Yemen Women’s Union in early May, refusing to renew its license, even though the Union had fulfilled the necessary requirements for renewal.

On May 12, representatives of the Southern Women’s Union demanded that the Yemen Women’s Union hand over its offices and exclusively serve women from the south and not those from “northern governorates,” even if they were living in Aden.

“We are a civil society organization,” a woman working with the Yemen Women’s Union said that she told the Southern Women’s Union. “We receive all women from everywhere, including some from Somalia and Ethiopia. We cannot turn away those seeking protection no matter where they are from.”

A woman working with the Yemen Women’s Union said that the next day, a building guard called the office to say that a group of women and men had stormed the office and replaced the Yemen Women’s Union sign with the Southern Women Union’s and raised a South Yemen flag, which is also the STC’s flag. Photographs shared on Facebook and X, formerly known as Twitter, on May 14 and verified by Human Rights Watch show a group of men and women carrying the Southern Women’s Union sign.

The Yemen Women’s Union contacted a woman in the office of the STC’s leader, Aidarous Al-Zabidi, asking the STC to recall their forces and order the Southern Women’s Union representatives to vacate the Yemen Women’s Union buildings. The woman they spoke with asked the armed men to withdraw, and they did.

However, on May 26, a group of men and women affiliated with the Southern Women’s Union stormed the office again. In one video, directly shared by an interviewee, a group of at least 40 women are seen outside the main gate. At least five women repeatedly pushed at the gate. Several people broke the main door of the office, disabled the cameras, and took over the office, a staff member said.

The people who raided the building were escorted by a military vehicle belonging to the STC’s Storm Brigade, said a person who was there and asked the soldiers herself. Human Rights Watch received two photographs from a witness who said they were taken on June 6 from inside the Yemen Women’s Union office. They show a tan-colored pickup truck with a heavy machine gun mounted in its bed, matching vehicles driven by the STC and the Yemeni military, parked next to a building. Human Rights Watch could not confirm to whom the vehicle belonged, but multiple people interviewed said that the STC is the only authority in Aden with armed forces and military vehicles.

“[The trespassers] insulted the women, questioned their honor, and threatened them with death,” a Yemen Women’s Union staff member said. “[The women] came to the shelter seeking protection, and instead, they were threatened with death and insulted. We are very concerned about them.”

Another video sent by the same source, shows three men using a hammer to try to break the lock on the main building’s door. Researchers could not establish when this video was recorded.

Human Rights Watch reviewed an official document dated May 26 from a public prosecutor in Aden addressed to the police station in Crater, the district of Aden where the Yemen Women’s Union office is located, ordering them to stop the attack, and send the attackers to the site where people are held during investigations. The Yemen Women’s Union lawyer said that she went to hand over the document to the Crater police station, which is under the STC’s authority, but that a police officer threw it on the ground, saying that the police did not recognize or accept these orders.

“We are living through a terrible time,” said a Yemen Women’s Union staff member, describing the conditions of the women and children who were trapped in the shelter. “We can’t sleep or do anything, we can’t go and visit them in the shelter.” She said that while sometimes employees have been able to drop off some food for the women sheltering there, those occupying the building did not allow them to bring medicine to one of the sheltered women’s sons who is sick, or allow the boy to leave for a hospital.

On June 23, the Yemen Women’s Union were able to reenter the building and continue working from their offices. However, staff members told Human Rights Watch that the Southern Women’s Union continues to occupy part of the building, based on STC directives to the Yemen Women’s Union that the building be shared.

This is not the first time the STC has seized the buildings of civil society organizations and other unaffiliated institutions. On February 28, 2023, STC-affiliated forces seized the headquarters of the Yemeni Journalists Syndicate. According to the Syndicate, the STC-backed Southern Media and Journalists’ Syndicate removed the Yemeni Journalists Syndicate’s sign from the building and replaced it with their own sign. In June 2021, STC-affiliated armed forces raided and seized control of the offices of Saba News Agency, the official news agency of the government of Yemen.

Other warring parties in Yemen, in particular the Houthis, have also repressed civil society in the country. Most recently, the Houthis have arbitrarily arrested and forcibly disappeared dozens of civil society and UN staff, apparently based on their employment.

(Paris) – The Olympic and Paralympic Games in France should usher in reforms to ensure tolerance, nondiscrimination, and the defense of fundamental human rights, Human Rights Watch said today in a new guide published for reporters covering the Games. The Paris 2024 Summer Games will hold its opening ceremony on the Seine River on July 26, 2024.

The 35-page “Reporters’ Guide: 2024 Paris Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games” summarizes rights concerns relevant to both the Paris Games and broader human rights concerns in France. The guide also describes the role of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and other Olympic committees and their relevance to promoting human rights at the Paris Olympics.

“The Olympic Games are a good moment to shine a light on France’s deteriorating rights record,” said Bénédicte Jeannerod, France director at Human Rights Watch. “For example, contrary to Olympic values of inclusion and nondiscrimination, racialized minorities, including migrants, face systemic abuse and discrimination in France.”

The upcoming Games take place against the backdrop of the recent snap legislative elections in France called by President Emmanuel Macron following the victory of the far-right National Rally (Rassemblement National) party in the June 9 European Parliament elections. The electoral campaign in France was marred by a rise in racist, xenophobic, and discriminatory rhetoric, alongside extreme political polarization. Civil society mobilized massively in favor of tolerance and nondiscrimination, and a majority of voters rejected being governed by the far-right. The new government has not yet been appointed.

The 2024 Games in Paris mark the centennial of the 1924 Paris Olympics and the third time Paris will host the Summer Games. With more than 200 countries competing at the Olympics and Paralympics, an expected 15 million tourists, and a global television audience of 5 billion, these Games are projected to be the most-watched ever.

The slogan for Paris 2024 is “Games Wide Open” or “Ouvrons grand les Jeux” in French. This motto is meant to show these Games will be more inclusive, open, and equal, including with gender parity in athlete participation.

France’s Olympic and Paralympic Games are the first to take place since the IOC adopted a human rights framework in 2022. The IOC has called Paris 2024 “the first edition of the Games that will embed human rights throughout the organisation and delivery of the event.”

But instead of raising the bar for human rights, as the Games open, there is worrying erosion of the rule of law in France and concerning reports of human rights violations.

The Olympic Charter expressly bans “discrimination of any kind” as a “fundamental principle of Olympism.” Headscarf restrictions for women athletes were overturned in global sport starting in 2014 because the ban excluded millions of women and girls from participation in sports like football and basketball.

However, in France, sporting authorities have put in place bans on French athletes wearing headscarves both at Paris 2024 and beyond, across all levels of sport. The country’s discrimination against women and girls wearing the hijab is particularly concerning given the IOC’s celebration of Paris 2024 as the first “Gender Equal Olympics.”

The effect of these bans is that women athletes from the Olympics’ own host nation are discriminated against and prevented from exercising their human rights. French Muslim women and girls who choose to wear hijab will never be able to qualify for these or future Games, since they are excluded from the necessary training and competition opportunities to reach the Olympic level. Muslim women athletes from other nations will compete at the Olympics and Paralympics wearing the hijab without restrictions.

Restrictions on fundamental freedoms are on the rise in France, with increasing limitations on freedom of expression, the right to peaceful protest, and freedom of association. The erosion of civic space is compounded by the expansion and use of invasive mass surveillance technologies, justified under the guise of security measures for events like the Olympics and Paralympics. France’s new “Olympics” surveillance law is the first of its kind in the European Union to explicitly legalize the use of controversial algorithm-driven video surveillance that risks discrimination against racialized minorities at the Games.

“International sports competitions should not have long-term negative policy consequences that reduce freedoms and basic rights for people in France and beyond,” Jeannerod said.

As thousands of national athletes arrive in Paris from all corners of the globe, the guide also covers abuse against athletes worldwide, including sexual and gender-based violence, child abuse in sport, and sex testing of women athletes. In research ranging from Japan and Haiti to Mali and India, Human Rights Watch has worked with athlete whistleblowers and survivors of abuse to report abuse and understand how sport creates systems that allow human rights abuses to flourish. Athletes and survivors are demanding reforms from national and international sport federations to put meaningful systems in place to safely report and investigate abuse.

Human Rights Watch reporters’ guide provides an overview of the human rights context in France and in global sport relevant to covering the Olympics and the Paralympics. It includes background on the Olympics and human rights, athletes who face systemic discrimination in participating in sports, communities whose members face systemic racism by French law enforcement, systemic abuses and reform efforts in the Olympic movement, and recent developments of human rights violations and cases of interest to cover.

“The true legacy of these Summer Games should not be measured only in medals or records but in the French government’s unwavering commitment to establish a lasting respect for human rights,” Jeannerod said.",HIGH,20240718T144500Z,Human Rights Watch,Bénédicte Jeannerod,French government and sporting authorities,"Paris, France","Reforms to enhance human rights, inclusivity, and address discrimination",Systemic abuse and discrimination against racialized minorities and women athletes wearing hijabs,France,"Rise in racist, xenophobic rhetoric; discrimination against women wearing hijabs"

(New York) – The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion on July 19, 2024, with significant consequences for human rights protections in Palestine under Israel’s 57-year occupation. The opinion stems from a December 2022 request by the United Nations General Assembly to the court to consider the legal consequences of Israel’s policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.

The following quote can be attributed to Tirana Hassan, Human Rights Watch Executive Director:

An Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) working group should show it is genuinely interested in engaging with civil society if it wants to produce an effective environmental rights declaration, as it resumes drafting today in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

The working group released its first – and so far only – version of the draft declaration in March 2024 and solicited public comments. Human Rights Watch made a submission in April raising concerns over the text’s lack of protections for Indigenous peoples and failure to include provisions on corporate accountability and climate-related mobility – when the effects of climate change compel people to move.

Other environmental and human rights groups in the region also made submissions to improve the draft. For example, in April, the Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact, which has 46 members across Asia, called attention to the absence of Indigenous representation in the drafting process. It also expressed concern that the draft was already complete when the working group consulted stakeholders, a process that goes against the right to information that the declaration aims to enshrine.

The working group met again in May in Jakarta, Indonesia, where it began considering the public submissions, but it has not released an updated version of the declaration since then. It has not published the submissions sent by civil society groups, despite a pledge to make these available via the Asia-Pacific Environmental Rights Observatory.

News of proposed guidelines in the Philippines that would make it easier for companies to conduct activities on Indigenous peoples’ land without their free, prior, and informed consent illustrate the need for stronger environmental rights protections. Human Rights Watch research in Indonesia, Malaysia, and elsewhere show Indigenous peoples are often dispossessed of land they have protected for generations.

After convening this week, the working group should publish the most recent version of the declaration and facilitate opportunities to hear from communities affected by environmental destruction. It should not submit the declaration for adoption until stakeholders have a real opportunity to consider whether it reflects the concerns of those at the front lines of environmental protection in the ASEAN region.",HIGH,20240701T010000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Activists, participants in the ASEAN working group",ASEAN working group,"Jakarta, Indonesia","Publish updated declaration, include community perspectives",Lack of protections for Indigenous peoples,Indonesia,"Corporate accountability issues, climate change impacts"

(Brussels) – The European Union should reconsider its bilateral human rights dialogue with Vietnam and adopt more effective measures to address the Vietnamese government’s intensifying repression, Human Rights Watch said today, based on its submission to the EU. The next round of the EU-Vietnam Human Rights Dialogue will take place on July 4, 2024, in Brussels.

The EU and Vietnam have engaged in human rights discussions since the 1990s. Over the years, the Vietnamese government has made very little progress on numerous issues raised by EU officials, and in recent years its repression has considerably intensified.

“The EU’s human rights dialogues with Vietnam have had little impact on Hanoi’s repression,” said Claudio Francavilla, associate EU advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. “More of the same won’t lead to different results. The EU needs a more effective approach to address Hanoi’s crackdown on basic freedoms.”

More than 160 people are currently imprisoned in Vietnam for criticizing the government, which is a criminal offense under the penal code. The authorities are increasingly targeting environmental activists, just as the EU and Vietnam have signed over €500 million (US$537 million) in agreements to support Vietnam’s transition to renewable energy. The Vietnamese Communist Party controls all media, and the government is the world’s third largest jailer of journalists. On June 1, the police arrested the prominent journalist Huy Duc and the lawyer Tran Dinh Trien for their pro-democracy posts on Facebook. Both were charged with “abusing the rights to democracy and freedom to infringe upon the interests of the State,” under article 331 of Vietnam’s penal code.

The authorities carry out intrusive surveillance of the internet, and posting or sharing criticism of the government online could lead to a long prison sentence.

Some of these abuses are linked to the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement, which entered into force in August 2020. Notably, the activists Mai Phan Loi and Dang Dinh Bach were arrested as they tried to join the Domestic Advisor Group (DAG), the entity tasked with monitoring implementation of the agreement. Mai Phan Loi was eventually released, in September 2023, but Dang Dinh Bach is still serving a five-year prison sentence. The activist Pham Chi Dung remains behind bars, serving a 15-year sentence for his peaceful advocacy in 2019 urging the EU to leverage Vietnam’s appetite for trade deals to secure human rights progress in the country; a call that Human Rights Watch and many other rights groups supported.

Vietnam has not ratified International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 87 on Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize, despite a specific pledge to do so by 2023, made ahead of the European Parliament’s February 2020 vote on the trade agreement.

These and other developments, recently acknowledged by all EU member states, members of the European Parliament, and European members of the Domestic Advisory Group, run counter to Vietnam’s pledges, including those undertaken in the EU trade deal. The European Commission stated that the deal “includes an institutional and legal link to the EU-Vietnam Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, allowing appropriate action in the case of serious breaches of human rights,” but no action has been taken. Some nongovernmental organizations have urged the suspension of the deal over labor abuse complaints.

The EU should not repeat fruitless human right dialogues that merely cultivate the illusion of addressing Vietnam’s human rights crackdown, Human Rights Watch said. The EU should consider more effective tools to press Vietnamese authorities to halt their abuses. In particular, the EU should review Vietnam’s compliance with its human rights commitments under the bilateral political and trade deals, and lay out the consequences for persistent failure to comply. Furthermore, the EU should consider adopting targeted sanctions against those responsible for systemic human rights abuses in the country, including Vietnam’s leadership, and take the lead in international forums to secure independent monitoring and reporting on Vietnam’s human rights record.

“Only targeted sanctions and concrete consequences for political and trade relations will flag to Hanoi that the EU is serious about human rights,” Francavilla said. “Unless the human rights dialogue is used to lay out those consequences, and benchmarks to avoid them, it will remain just another box-ticking exercise.”",HIGH,20240703T054500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Huy Duc, Tran Dinh Trien, Pham Chi Dung, Mai Phan Loi, Dang Dinh Bach",Vietnamese government,Vietnam,"More effective measures from the EU, targeted sanctions, independent monitoring of human rights record",Intensifying repression and lack of progress on human rights issues,Vietnam,"Government control over media, lack of political freedoms, punitive laws against dissent"

Mr. President,

Human Rights Watch thanks the Special Rapporteur for her report and tireless work to document the human rights situation in Belarus.

Her mandate has been a lifeline for civil society and human rights defenders as the authorities have sought to stamp out civic space and freedom of expression and association – we thank her for that.

With partners, Human Rights Watch has documented systematic and widespread retaliation against lawyers, who are being targeted for representing clients in politically motivated cases. At least six lawyers are currently serving sentences ranging from 6 to 10 years on bogus politically motivated charges.[1] One of them, Maksim Znak, has been held in incommunicado detention since February 2023. Many more have been arbitrarily detained, had their licenses arbitrarily revoked on politically motivated grounds, and subjected to other forms of harassment and threats. This tactic of repression is making a mockery of the judicial system and depriving Belarusians of their right to a fair trial and equal protection under the law.

We remain deeply alarmed by the harassment of families of those detained, and the increased use of incommunicado detention, contributing to the wider climate of fear.

Given the conclusion of the OHCHR examination that some of these rights abuses committed in the context of the increased repression since 2020 may amount to crimes against humanity, member states should implement the Special Rapporteur’s recommendations to protect Belarusians in exile and advance accountability for international crimes.

We would like to ask the Special Rapporteur which testimonies she has heard over the past six years have marked her the most.

The US State Department has released its annual Trafficking in Persons (TIPs) Report ranking nearly 200 countries’ anti-trafficking efforts.

The report finds perpetrators increasingly use “social media, online advertisements, websites, dating apps, and gaming platforms” to force, defraud, or coerce job seekers into labor and sexual exploitation, and encourages technology companies to use “data and algorithm tools to detect human trafficking patterns, identify suspicious and illicit activity, and report” these to law enforcement.

Sweeping calls to collect data on marginalized populations and automate decisions about what constitutes a human trafficking pattern are dangerous. Women of color, migrants, and queer people face profiling and persecution under surveillance regimes that fail to distinguish between consensual adult sex work and human trafficking.

The TIPs report says artificial intelligence (AI) language models, can “detect, translate, and categorize key words used by traffickers to identify trafficking communication patterns.” Unfortunately, language models are likely to be built on discriminatory stereotypes which have plagued anti-trafficking efforts for decades.

A Department of Homeland Security campaign, for example, instructs hotels to train housekeeping staff to report “signs of human trafficking” based on indicators that conflate sex work with trafficking. Victims allegedly request “additional towels,” “wait at a table or bar to be picked up,” “dress inappropriately,” “rent rooms by the hour,” and collect cash “left on tables.” Such tropes cause disproportionate surveillance of poor, racialized, and transgender sex workers, and inaccurately categorize standard safety tactics - public first meetings, hygiene, avoiding traceable payments - as trafficking indicators.

Studies show that digital tools and policies which take an similarly broad approach to collecting evidence of alleged exploitation online are dangerous and counterproductive. A 2024 report found platforms are “incentivized to overreport” potential child sexual abuse material (CSAM), leaving law enforcement “overwhelmed by the high volume” and unable to identify perpetrators. A 2022 study into technology which scraped and analyzed advertisements for sexual services found “misalignment between developers, users of the platform, and sex industry workers they are attempting to assist,” concluding that these approaches are “ineffective” and “exacerbate harm.”

Trafficking survivors, meanwhile, have warned that “trafficking data is both limited and notoriously inaccurate [and] bad data means bad learning.” Outsourcing to an algorithm the detection and reporting of “suspicious and illicit activity” is a recipe for perpetuating violence and discrimination against already marginalized people.",HIGH,20240701T104500Z,US State Department,"Trafficking survivors, Department of Homeland Security",Perpetrators of human trafficking,"Online platforms, hotels","Need for nuanced understanding of trafficking, caution against broad data collection and use of AI in detecting trafficking patterns",Exploitation of job seekers through digital platforms,United States,"Discriminatory stereotypes, lack of distinction between consensual sex work and trafficking"

(Beirut) – The United Nations Human Rights Council should establish an international fact-finding mission into the August 4, 2020 blast at Beirut’s port, 18 organizations including Human Rights Watch, and dozens of relatives of the victims of the blast said in a statement released today.

Nearly four years after the blast, nobody has been held to account, and the Lebanese authorities have continuously obstructed the investigation, leading to its suspension in December 2021.

“While other countries have condemned the Lebanese authorities’ continuous interference into the domestic investigation, authorities have blatantly ignored demands for accountability,” said Ramzi Kaiss, Lebanon researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Human Rights Council member states should take action at their current session to support the establishment of an international fact-finding mechanism if there ever is to be justice for the disastrous Beirut blast.”",HIGH,20240701T104500Z,Human Rights Watch and 18 organizations,Ramzi Kaiss,Lebanese authorities,Beirut port,Establishment of an international fact-finding mechanism,Obstruction of the investigation into the Beirut port blast,Lebanon,Continuous interference by Lebanese authorities

(Nairobi) – Kenyan security forces shot directly into crowds of protesters on June 25, 2024, including protesters who were fleeing, Human Rights Watch said today.

Protests began in cities and towns across Kenya and online after the Finance Bill 2024 was introduced in parliament on June 18. The protests have been organized largely by Kenyans between the ages of 18 and 35, airing their grievances notably through social media. They expressed outrage over provisions of the bill that would raise taxes on goods and services that many people depend on, such as bread, and on mobile money transfers, to meet International Monetary Fund (IMF) revenue targets. Government spending on social programs has already been steadily decreasing and reports of wasteful public spending with impunity abound.

“Shooting directly into crowds without justification, including as protesters try to flee, is completely unacceptable under Kenyan and international law,” said Otsieno Namwaya, associate Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “The Kenyan authorities need to make clear to their forces that they should be protecting peaceful protesters and that impunity for police violence can no longer be tolerated.”

Kenyan authorities should ensure that security agencies deployed to protests protect the right to peaceful protest and refrain from using excessive and lethal force, Human Rights Watch said. The authorities should take immediate steps to investigate the killings of over two dozen people protesting the government’s proposed tax measures. On May 26, the president announced that he would not sign the Finance Bill and was instead sending it back to parliament with a proposal to delete all the clauses. He also said he would introduce austerity measures across the executive branch.

On June 25, protesters gathered in cities and towns across the country, including outside of parliament in Nairobi. In the afternoon, as parliament was meeting, the police opened fire on protesters in and around parliament, witnesses and journalists told Human Rights Watch. Although there is no confirmation on the exact number of people killed in Nairobi and other towns, Human Rights Watch found that at least 30 people had been killed on that day based on witness accounts, publicly available information, hospital and mortuary records in Nairobi, as well as witness accounts in Nakuru, Eldoret, and Meru. The Police Reforms Working Group - Kenya reported that 23 people had also been shot dead by the police by the evening of June 25, most of them over the course of the previous week.

Human Rights Watch interviewed 11 people including three family members of victims, a mortuary attendant, two parliamentary staff present in parliament on the afternoon of June 25, two photojournalists covering the protests, and three human rights activists involved in efforts to locate many of those missing in various parts of the country.

The journalists and parliamentary staff said that around 2 p.m., the General Service Unit, a paramilitary force deployed around the parliament, shot directly at unarmed people attempting to force their way into the National Assembly. Media reported that eight protesters were killed, though the actual number is most likely higher. At around 4 p.m., protesters breached the security and perimeter walls and stormed parliament, forcing legislators to seek shelter in other parts of the building.

Media reported that the General Service Unit and military forces were deployed around 5 p.m. to rescue the lawmakers. Five witnesses said that some members of the security forces shot indiscriminately at fleeing protesters, killing an unknown number. Footage on KTN TV at around 5 p.m. captured police beating and shooting at fleeing protesters inside the precincts of parliament.

The two journalists and one parliamentary staff member said they saw armed personnel on the parliament building roof and on top of the 28-floor Kenyatta International Conference Centre shooting at protesters.

At least three people interviewed, including one family member of a young man who was killed, said that at around 5:30 p.m. in the Githurai area of Nairobi, several military officers from Kahawa Barracks arrived to find a section of the Nairobi-Thika Highway barricaded with stones by protesters, who had set a police anti-riot vehicle on fire.

A human rights activist in the area said that when the military officers arrived, “Eight military officers came out and just opened fire on people. They killed several people, including those who were not part of the protests. It is not known how many people in total were killed, but at around 8 p.m. when the military officers stopped shooting at people, we confirmed at least 22 were dead.” The activist said that the shooting by the military joined by the police resumed at 10 p.m. and continued until 11 p.m. Police told the media that 20 of their officers were injured in Githurai after more than 6,000 youth attacked them. The Law Society of Kenya has called for an independent investigation into the events in Githurai.

On June 26, Human Rights Watch visited Kenyatta National Hospital’s mortuary and saw six bodies of protesters that hospital records showed had been brought in by officers from both the Nairobi central police station and Kamukunji police station. Researchers found six more bodies at the Nairobi City Mortuary brought in by officers from Kamukunji police station, along with an additional six at Mama Lucy Hospital and eight at Kenyatta University Referral Hospital. Human Rights Watch research shows that police killed at least three people in the town of Eldoret, one person in Nakuru, and one in Meru.

Researchers also visited several hospital wards. At Kenyatta hospital an official said that at least 165 people injured during the protests on June 25 had been admitted. A doctor at Kenyatta National Hospital said that two were dead on arrival, 24 needed immediate surgery, and 72 were treated for injuries and discharged. The majority of those admitted had blunt force trauma injuries from being hit by kinetic impact projectiles and bullet wounds.

Several people told Human Rights Watch that their relatives are missing. Kenyan authorities should provide timely information about the whereabouts and situation of people reported missing, Human Rights Watch said.

On June 24, pro-government protesters erected pro-Finance Bill 2024 banners in downtown Nairobi. Two human rights activists who participated in the anti-Finance Bill protests said that on the morning of June 25, the pro-government protesters briefly clashed with the anti-Finance Bill protesters in downtown Nairobi and in Eldoret town. Kenyan media reported that pro-government protesters in Eldoret, who chanted war songs, were back on the streets on June 27, this time armed with batons, bows, and arrows, but later returned their weapons to the Eldoret county government offices on the evening of June 27.

Speaking to the media on the evening of June 25, President William Ruto described protesters as “treasonous” and “organized criminals” who hijacked the protests to cause mayhem. He also announced the deployment of the army to support the police.

Kenyan human rights groups have criticized the president for deploying the military without getting the parliamentary approval required under Kenyan law. The Law Society of Kenya challenged the constitutionality and sequencing of the deployment in court, and on June 27 the High Court ruled that the deployment was legal and necessary, giving the cabinet secretary two days to regularize the deployment by publishing in the official government gazette details about the area, duration, and nature of the deployment as required by Kenyan law. Military forces were deployed in several parts of Nairobi at renewed protests on June 27. Meanwhile, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights said it would launch an inquiry into the excessive use of force and indiscriminate shooting by the security forces.

Kenya’s international partners should continue to actively monitor the situation and any likely prosecutions resulting from the protests, and further urge Kenyan authorities to speedily but credibly and transparently investigate abuses by the security forces, Human Rights Watch said. International human rights bodies, including the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights and UN special rapporteurs, should monitor the crisis and consider requesting to visit Kenya to investigate any alleged abuses. The authorities should grant the special rapporteurs together with other independent rights monitors access to conduct such investigations, Human Rights Watch said.

The Finance Bill 2024 was introduced in the context of an IMF program approved in 2021. It includes several revenue-raising measures that would increase the costs of many goods and services essential for rights, particularly for Kenyans with lower and middle incomes and for women. The IMF program introduced sweeping reforms, some of which have already exacerbated a cost-of-living crisis. The bill was expected to raise an additional US$2.3 billion in the next fiscal year, in part to meet IMF requirements to increase revenues.

The IMF should assess the conditions of its program with Kenya, revising them and the social spending floor to ensure that the program is not exacerbating poverty or inequality or preventing the government from meeting its human rights obligations, Human Rights Watch said.

“Widespread outrage should be a wake-up call to the Kenyan government and the IMF that they cannot sacrifice rights in the name of economic recovery,” Namwaya said. “Economic sustainability can only be achieved by building a new social contract that raises revenues fairly, manages them responsibly, and funds services and programs that protect everyone’s rights.”",VERY HIGH,20240701T104500Z,Human Rights Watch,"President William Ruto, Otsieno Namwaya (Human Rights Watch)",Kenyan Security Forces,"Cities and towns across Kenya, including Nairobi","Investigate police violence, protect the right to protest, assess IMF program impact on human rights",Excessive and lethal force against peaceful protesters,Kenya,Proposed Finance Bill 2024 raising taxes on essential goods and services

Of all the countries with the most appalling human rights records, Eritrea is probably the least known internationally.

Even folks who don’t have anything to do with foreign affairs are generally aware of North Korea’s horrors and Saudi Arabia’s long list of abuses.

Eritrea’s? Not so much.

However, once you learn about this country in the Horn of Africa, you’ll never forget.

For more than 30 years since gaining independence in 1993, Eritrea has suffered under the one-man rule of unelected President Isaias Afewerki. There are no independent courts, no legislature – essentially nothing to check his power.

Afewerki and his regime call all the shots, and no dissent is allowed. Opposition parties can’t operate. There are no independent civil society groups and no independent media.

Perhaps the most serious set of human rights abuses in the country concerns the government’s policy of indefinite national service, including compulsory military conscription.

The authorities draft Eritreans – both men and unmarried women, including students and children – and you have to stay in the military or civil service until… who knows? Two years, five years, fourteen years, more? That’s the “indefinite” part: your national service doesn’t end until the government says it ends. It’s completely arbitrary.

And for all those uncountable years you’re a conscript, you’ll often be facing inhuman and degrading punishment, including torture. Oh, and if you try to evade the draft, the authorities will retaliate against your family.

It’s no wonder so many Eritreans try to escape the country and end up as refugees abroad. Often they attempt to get to the EU, where most people are unaware of their plight and where some people elect politicians promising to punish refugees on the misguided notion that being cruel here will somehow stop people fleeing unknown situations elsewhere.

International ignorance about Eritrea (and other human rights crisis zones) is thus not just a shame intellectually; it has impacts on politics close to home.

One of the few ways the international community draws at least some attention to Eritrea’s abuses is through the office of the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Eritrea, Dr. Mohamed Abdelsalam Babiker. He recently delivered a report to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, outlining the horrors mentioned above and much more.

Next week, his mandate comes up for renewal. Some countries, like Russia and Iran, are trying to sink it, but let’s hope other countries manage to push it through.

(Brussels) – Judges are set to deliberate on a verdict in a landmark domestic trial in Guinea for gross human rights abuses committed by government security forces in 2009, Human Rights Watch said today. The closing arguments of all parties in the trial concluded on June 26, 2024. The judges indicated they will deliberate on a verdict until July 31.

The trial examines one of Guinea’s worst episodes of abuse. On September 28, 2009, Guinean security forces opened fire on a peaceful protest against a bid for the presidency by the then-coup leader Moussa Dadis Camara. More than 150 people were killed and more than 100 women were raped in a stadium in Conakry, the capital. Security forces then engaged in a cover-up, burying bodies in mass graves.

“All eyes will be on Conakry as the long-awaited verdict will provide a measure of reckoning with the brutal abuses of nearly 15 years ago, the effects of which continue to be felt by victims and survivors,” said Tamara Aburamadan, international justice counsel at Human Rights Watch. “The Guinean government should support further national accountability efforts to strengthen its system for addressing serious international crimes.”

Guinean victims and survivors have repeatedly called for revealing the truth and holding those responsible for the brutal 2009 events to account.

This trial is the first of its kind involving human rights violations of this scale in Guinea. It has widely captured the nation’s attention, amid a sustained crackdown on the opposition, dissenters, and the media, leaving hundreds dead and hundreds more injured at the hands of state security forces in Guinea, according to a report by Amnesty International.

Since the trial commenced on September 28, 2022, judges have heard from each of the 11 accused, among them a former president and government ministers, more than 100 victims, and over a dozen witnesses, including high-level government officials. Before the closing arguments started on May 13, judges heard again from three of the accused, among others, during what is known as the “confrontations” phase.

Over the past few weeks, all parties in the trial presented their closing arguments. Thirteen lawyers acting as civil parties – that is, victims with a standing in the case – were followed by the prosecution and the defense counsel for the 11 accused.

Based on Human Rights Watch’s monitoring of the trial and media reports, the victims’ lawyers laid out the horrific events of 2009 and detailed the alleged individual criminal responsibility of each of the accused. Some of the victim’s lawyers requested convictions for crimes against humanity and life sentences for the accused.

In the event of convictions, at least five victims’ lawyers asked the judges to grant a range of reparations claims – between one to three billion Guinean francs (approximately US$115,000 to $345,000) – for each group of victims, including those who have suffered physical and psychological trauma.

Many victims, including survivors of rape and sexual violence, still lack the resources to access medical care for the injuries they suffered in the attack on the stadium and the events that followed, according to the Association of Victims, Relatives and Friends of September 28, 2009.

During the closing arguments phase, the prosecution restated its March request to reclassify the charges to crimes against humanity against the 11 accused and further requested sentences ranging from 14 years to life. Judges have indicated they will only rule on the reclassification of charges request when delivering the verdict.

The defendants include Claude Pivi, a former government minister who remains a fugitive at the time of writing after leaving the detention facility in November 2023 with armed forces and three others of the highest-level accused, including former President Dadis Camara. All the other ten accused, including the three who left the detention facility, are now detained.

In its closing arguments, the defense counsel requested acquittals and responded to the prosecution’s reclassification of charges request. They argued that issuing a reclassification decision at the time of the verdict would violate fair trial rights of the accused, leaving them without the opportunity to defend against the new charges.

Guinean law on criminal procedure provides for internationally accepted rights of the accused, including the right to adequate time and facilities to prepare a defense and the right to a fair hearing.

After the verdict is delivered, the accused and the civil parties have the right to appeal within 15 days. The prosecution has two months to appeal.

Over the years, Guinea’s international partners, including the United Nations, the European Union, and the United States, have encouraged advances in the pursuit of justice for the September 28, 2009 crimes in Guinea. The International Criminal Court (ICC) Office of the Prosecutor also sought to constructively engage with the Guinean authorities to press them to deliver on their early commitment to bring justice in this case.

The role of international actors, including the ICC, appears to have been a major factor in galvanizing progress over time. Continued international support and engagement with the Guinean authorities on the critical importance of justice, including reparations processes, will be essential.

“The conclusion of the stadium massacre trial and the prospect of a verdict provide a glimmer of hope for Guinean victims and survivors that justice can prevail over impunity,” Aburamadan said. “They deserve to see justice realized in a manner that is fair and effective.”",VERY HIGH,20240701T054500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Moussa Dadis Camara (former coup leader), Claude Pivi (former government minister), victims' lawyers, international organizations",Guinean government security forces and former officials,"Stadium in Conakry, Guinea",Support for national accountability efforts; better access to medical care for victims; international engagement for justice,Gross human rights abuses during the 2009 stadium massacre,Guinea,Political instability and violent crackdowns on dissent

(Berlin, July 1, 2024) – Uzbekistan authorities have increasingly cracked down on calls for independence in the autonomous republic of Karakalpakstan since protests broke out there two years ago, Human Rights Watch said today.

But Uzbekistan has also yet to hold any senior officials accountable for the excessive force used to quell the protests against proposed constitutional amendments in July 2022. The amendments would have stripped the region of its autonomous status and barred a referendum for independence.

“Uzbekistan’s leadership has not only failed to ensure justice for those killed in the Karakalpakstan protests two years ago, but we’ve also seen a notable increase in repression of other Karakalpak activists ever since,” said Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Uzbekistan’s partners should renew calls for justice and condemn the ongoing crackdown on activists both inside and outside Karakalpakstan.”

On July 1 and 2, 2022, Uzbekistan’s security forces used unjustified lethal force and other forms of excessive force, including discharging small arms and grenades to disperse mainly peaceful protesters in Karakalpakstan. At least 21 people died, including 4 law enforcement officers. Over 270 were injured.

Uzbek authorities backed off the proposed constitutional changes, but they have since taken a heavy hand to anyone who has spoken out or acted in favor of Karakalpakstan’s independence.

The authorities arrested more than 500 people in the immediate aftermath of the protests, and in two high-profile criminal trials, prosecuted a total of 61 people, including lawyers, bloggers, activists, and journalists, for their alleged involvement. Dauletmurat Tazhimuratov, a blogger and lawyer who first called for peaceful protests, was sentenced to 16 years in prison. Police and the courts ignored his allegations of ill-treatment and torture.

Human Rights Watch has reviewed court documents from the prosecution since July 2022 of nine Karakalpak activists on criminal charges of “attempting to overthrow the constitutional order” and “producing or distributing material that threatens public safety.” Human Rights Watch also reviewed media reports and statements issued by rights groups. In mid-June, Human Rights Watch wrote to the Uzbek government to request information about the cases but has received no response.

The arrests and prosecutions, including of diaspora Karakalpaks, for no more than peaceful expression of their political opinions, violates internationally protected rights to freedom of expression and assembly, and are inconsistent with Uzbekistan’s reform pledges and purported human rights agenda, Human Rights Watch said.

Two activists – Saaditdin Reimov, 57, and Kungratbay Redzhepov, 57 – were sentenced in December 2022 to four and seven years in prison, respectively. Reimov had expressed his support for a peaceful protest on September 1, 2022, to demand the release of political prisoners, while Redzhepov had called in October 2020 for a rally to demand independence for Karakalpakstan. Both had previously served 15-day administrative sentences for trying to go to the Karakalpakstan capital, Nukus, during the 2022 protests.

Arepbay Aitmuratov was sentenced to seven years in a prison colony on May 10, 2023, for videos he shared in Telegram channels that, according to a state-ordered expert analysis, allegedly contained “ideas of separatism information aimed at inciting panic among the population.” The verdict, which effectively criminalized the expression of ideas, did not specify what language served as the basis for the criminal charges.

An ethnic Turkmen from Karakalpakstan, Jumasapar Dadebaev, 37, who had been living in Türkiye, was forcibly returned to Uzbekistan in January 2022, then arrested. On August 10, 2022, following a closed trial, a Tashkent court convicted Dadebaev of over a dozen criminal charges, including “attempting to overthrow the constitutional order,” “insulting the president,” and “producing or distributing materials containing a threat to public order,” and sentenced him to 12 years in prison.

While Dadebaev was not involved in the July 2022 protests, he had previously called for Karakalpakstan’s independence, criticized government officials, and called for peaceful protests.

Uzbekistan has also targeted diaspora activists, in particular those living in Kazakhstan, with unfounded criminal charges. In September 2023, Uzbekistan courts prosecuted in absentia five diaspora Karakalpaks, – Koshkarbai Toremuratov, Zhangeldy Zhaksymbetov, Raisa Khudaibergenova, Ziyuar Mirmanbetova, and Tleubike Yuldasheva – sentencing them to between 3 years and 10 years and 1 month in prison. Police in Kazakhstan have arrested three more Karakalpaks since the start of this year. Uzbekistan has sought their extradition.

On February 22, 2024, Uzbekistan’s Supreme Court ruled that Alga Karakalpakstan, an opposition group in Karakalpakstan, is “extremist” and banned its activities in Uzbekistan. The movement’s leader, Aman Sagidullaev, a Karakalpak activist who has political asylum in Norway, was prosecuted in absentia in connection with the July 2022 protests and sentenced to 18 years in prison.

A human rights defender Vitaliy Ponamarev, told Human Rights Watch that at least one person, Parakhat Musapbarov, has already been prosecuted for alleged membership in Alga Karakalpakstan. On May 30, 2024, the Khojeli district court sentenced Musapbarov to six years in prison under article 244-2, or “membership in a banned extremist organization.”

In the meantime, authorities have failed to ensure justice for the people killed or injured in the 2022 protests, Human Rights Watch said.

Three police officers have been prosecuted for “illegal actions” during the protests. The Kagan City Court on August 4, 2023, sentenced two of them to seven years in prison for torture, and another to three years in prison for perjury and leaving a person in danger resulting in his death in connection with the Karakalpakstan events. But information about the prosecutions was only made public after sentencing, and little is known about the cases, including the specific crimes.

In December 2022, the Prosecutor General’s Office announced that it was investigating two deaths and the use of weapons to dispel the protests in Karakalpakstan, but no further information about the investigations has been made public.

A so-called independent parliamentary commission tasked in July 2022 with investigating human rights violations committed during and after the events has yet to publish its findings.

Uzbek authorities should stop imprisoning Karakalpaks for peacefully expressing a desire for an independent Karakalpakstan, release those who have been wrongfully imprisoned, and take urgent steps to ensure justice for those killed during the 2022 events, Human Rights Watch said.

Uzbekistan’s partners, in particular the European Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany, all of whom have representatives in Tashkent, have an important role to play to hold Uzbekistan accountable for ensuring justice for those killed in the protests in July 2022, and in securing the release of wrongfully imprisoned Karakalpak activists and others, Human Rights Watch said.

“Locking up Karakalpak activists for alleged ‘anti-constitutional’ activities, while ignoring the need to ensure accountability for the lives lost during the events of July 2022 is deeply cynical on the part of Uzbek authorities,” Williamson said. “Uzbekistan’s partners, who have made muted references to this recent crackdown, need to speak up, and do so urgently.”",HIGH,20240701T054500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Dauletmurat Tazhimuratov, Saaditdin Reimov, Kungratbay Redzhepov, Arepbay Aitmuratov, Jumasapar Dadebaev",Uzbekistan authorities,"Karakalpakstan, Uzbekistan","Stop imprisoning Karakalpaks for peaceful expression, ensure justice for victims of protests",Crackdown on calls for independence and excessive force used to quell protests,Uzbekistan,Proposed constitutional amendments stripping autonomous status

(Geneva) – All victims of gross human rights violations in Palestine and Israel are owed reparation, Human Rights Watch said today. Human Rights Watch on June 26 submitted recommendations to the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967. The rapporteur, Francesca Albanese, had invited input to inform her October 2024 report to the United Nations General Assembly on the ongoing hostilities.

Under international law, governments responsible for abuses are obliged to provide effective remedies for human rights violations, including through truth, justice, compensation, memorialization, and guarantees of non-recurrence. Non-state armed groups also have responsibilities to provide reparation. Reparation processes should center on the rights of victims and be carried out after meaningful and effective consultations with them. Other countries that have, or whose businesses have, supported one side or the other should contribute to reparations and all other countries should press the parties to the conflict to commit to provide reparations.

“The parties to the conflict need to repair the harm they have caused to victims in the ongoing hostilities,” said Clive Baldwin, senior legal adviser at Human Rights Watch. “Governments supporting Israel and Palestinian armed groups should not only use their leverage to stop further abuses, but also to ensure that victims and survivors receive meaningful reparations.”

Albanese sought submissions from civil society, academics, governments, and others on her upcoming report, which will examine “how Israel’s post-October-7 policies and practices have impacted the rights of the Palestinian people in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem (since 7 October 2023), and in Gaza (since 1 March 2024, which marked the end of the last reporting period).”

Israeli forces have unlawfully attacked residential buildings, medical facilities, and aid workers, and used starvation as a weapon of war in the Gaza Strip, which has suffered a staggering toll of 37,600 people killed. Israel has restricted imports of aid to Gaza as well as medical evacuations, leaving people who have been wounded, women and girls giving birth, people with disabilities and chronic conditions, and others with no or inadequate medical treatment, with devastating consequences. Israeli authorities have detained and mistreated thousands of Palestinians, with persistent reports of torture.

In the Gaza Strip, Israeli forces have displaced the majority of the population, including through unlawful evacuation orders, and destroyed the majority of homes, schools, hospitals, agricultural land, and other civilian infrastructure, with many forced to live in unsafe, unsanitary conditions. In the West Bank, where Israeli forces have killed over 500 Palestinians, Israeli authorities have forcibly displaced entire Palestinian communities. These abuses take place in a context in which Israeli authorities are accelerating illegal settlement expansion, subjecting Palestinian prisoners to deteriorating conditions, and committing the continuing crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution against Palestinians.

Palestinian armed groups on October 7 killed over 800 civilians in southern Israel, mistreated and inflicted sexual and gender-based violence on people they detained, took 251 hostages, destroyed homes, and have continued to launch indiscriminate rockets at population centers.

Both the Israeli authorities and Palestinian armed groups should cease all violations, guarantee that they will not recur, and that they will take measures to address the harm they have done, Human Rights Watch said.

In particular the Israeli authorities should ensure that wounded Palestinians in need of medical treatment and rehabilitation can exit Gaza to obtain it and guarantee their right to return.

Israel should also ensure financial and other support and cooperation to rebuild Gaza, and support the return of Palestinians to homes from which they were displaced in the West Bank. Israel should provide restitution by lifting the ban on Palestinians’ permanently returning to their former communities in what is now Israel, Human Rights Watch said. It should provide financial compensation to all Palestinians for the harm suffered from the crimes committed against them, including physical, psychological, and economic harm.

Israel should support survivors’ access to the truth by allowing visits by independent rights investigators, complying with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) order to provide fact-finding and investigative bodies unimpeded access into Gaza, and ceasing reported efforts to undermine the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor’s investigation.

On their side, Palestinian armed groups and Hamas should immediately release civilian hostages, ensure accountability, and provide compensation to victims’ families and to survivors of unlawful attacks and other serious violations in Israel, Human Rights Watch said.

All parties should bring legislation and military orders into compliance with international law. For example, Israel should affirm the applicability of international law to its obligations in occupied Palestinian territory, and dismantle all forms of systematic oppression and discrimination, including laws and policies that violate the prohibitions on apartheid and persecution.

Third countries that provided offensive weapons to the parties to the conflict despite awareness of gross human rights abuses – including among others Germany, Iran, Italy, the UK, and the US as the largest arms supplier – should contribute to reparation. The home countries of businesses that have contributed to or benefited from Israel’s military campaign in Gaza should also ensure reparation for businesses’ roles in violations. Governments should commit to support and assist Palestinians’ return to their communities in Gaza, the West Bank, and in Israel, and third states and others should support compensation as needed.

Reparation could include full apologies from Israel, the United States, Hamas, and Islamic Jihad, as well as investigations into atrocity crimes in Palestine and Israel and accountability for those responsible.

“It is vital for any future reparation discussions to ensure meaningful and effective consultations with Palestinian and Israeli victims, as reparation should be centered around their rights,” Baldwin said.",VERY HIGH,20240701T051500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Clive Baldwin, Francesca Albanese",Israeli authorities and Palestinian armed groups,Gaza Strip and West Bank,"Reparations for victims, cessation of violations, compliance with international law.",Gross human rights violations and failure to provide reparations to victims.,Palestine and Israel,Conflicts and hostilities between Israel and Palestinian armed groups; illegal settlement expansion

Ethiopian security forces have committed widespread attacks amounting to war crimes against medical professionals, patients, and health facilities in the Amhara region.

against medical professionals, patients, and health facilities in the Amhara region. Civilians are bearing the brunt of fighting between the Ethiopian military and Amhara militia known as Fano, which began in August 2023.

Ethiopia’s international partners should call for accountability and an end to attacks on healthcare and should resume increased scrutiny of the rights situation in the country.

(Nairobi) – Ethiopian security forces have committed widespread attacks amounting to war crimes against medical professionals, patients, and health facilities in the country’s northwestern Amhara region, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today.

The 66-page report, “‘If the Soldier Dies, It’s On You’: Attacks on Medical Care in Ethiopia’s Amhara Conflict,” documents how Ethiopian federal forces and a government-affiliated militia have attacked medical workers, healthcare facilities, and transports in at least 13 towns since the outbreak of fighting between Ethiopian federal forces and Amhara militia known as Fano in August 2023. Ethiopia’s international partners should call for accountability and an end to attacks on healthcare and should resume increased scrutiny of the rights situation in the country.

“Ethiopian federal forces operating with near impunity are unsurprisingly disregarding civilian lives by attacking medical facilities that are providing desperately needed care,” said Laetitia Bader, deputy Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “So long as the government feels no pressure to hold abusive forces to account, such atrocities are likely to continue.”

Between August 2023 and May 2024, Human Rights Watch interviewed remotely 58 victims and witnesses to abuses as well as medical professionals and aid workers. Human Rights Watch also reviewed satellite imagery and verified videos and photographs following an apparent government drone strike on an ambulance in November.

Human Rights Watch found that Ethiopian forces endangered or disrupted the functioning of hospitals. Soldiers beat, arbitrarily arrested, and intimidated medical professionals for providing care to the injured and sick, including alleged Fano fighters. The soldiers also unlawfully attacked ambulances and medical transports, interfered with access to humanitarian assistance, and denied the Amhara population the right to health.

In January, Ethiopian soldiers detained and interrogated a medical professional for several days in a military camp. “The colonel [interrogating me] called me a ‘Fano doctor,’” he said. “He started asking why I was giving treatment to the Fano. He said [the Fano] are not humans … they are monsters.”

Federal forces have obstructed access to medical facilities, including by wrongfully arresting patients on mere suspicion of a Fano affiliation, causing widespread fear for those that may seek or need treatment.

International humanitarian law, also known as the laws of war, prohibits attacks on civilians and civilian objects. In addition, it affords special protections to health facilities, medical professionals, patients, and ambulances. Even during an armed conflict, international human rights law remains in effect and contains core obligations for countries to maintain minimum essential levels of the right to health.

The fighting in Amhara has disrupted the delivery of medical supplies, leading to acute and prolonged shortages of essential medicines in hospitals and health centers, affecting their ability to provide adequate care.

Doctors and health staff have worked under dire and difficult conditions. “We have shortages of oxygen and medication, and since there is no power, we are struggling,” said one doctor working in a hospital in November 2023. “The blood bank has stopped collecting blood. ... Yesterday, we had to tell an expectant mother’s family to come with 20 liters or any amount of fuel they can bring so we can operate on them using the generator.”

Doctors seeking to replenish depleted hospital supplies have aroused the suspicion of government forces and in some cases have come under attack, affecting their ability to provide care to patients in a safe environment. On November 30, an apparent drone strike on a clearly marked ambulance in Wegel Tena town killed at least four civilians, badly wounded one, and destroyed much-needed medical supplies. “Psychologically, hospital staff are disturbed and living in fear of another attack,” a doctor said. “All the medications in the ambulance burned. We had used the little budget we had left to procure the medications.”

Humanitarian aid agencies working to fill gaps in medical supplies and equipment have also faced an increasingly difficult operating environment since August 2023. Their work has been affected by ongoing fighting, attacks on aid workers, towns frequently changing control, and movement restrictions, including difficulty moving to Fano-controlled areas. Nine aid workers have been killed in Amhara since the fighting started, at least four of them since January.

In March, Amhara regional health officials acknowledged that the ongoing conflict in the region between government forces and Fano militias have caused extensive damage to the healthcare system, though they claimed that “extremist forces” had pillaged 967 facilities and seized 124 ambulances.

Human Rights Watch wrote to Ethiopian authorities in June concerning the organization’s findings. The Ethiopian government has not responded.

Since the United Nations Human Rights Council failed to renew the UN-mandated inquiry on Ethiopia in October 2023, there has been limited international monitoring of the human rights situation in the country. Independent journalists have also had little access to the Amhara region. As part of its global mandate, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights released a report on the human rights situation in Ethiopia on June 14, saying that Ethiopian federal forces and the Fano militia had been involved in numerous violations of international humanitarian law, resulting in over 2,000 civilian casualties in the Amhara region.

The Ethiopian government should immediately end attacks on medical professionals, patients, health facilities, and transports in the Amhara region. Ethiopian authorities should also work to strengthen the country’s legal framework to protect health care by passing specific legislation that protects healthcare workers, medical professionals, and health facilities.

International donors have acted to rehabilitate damaged health facilities in Amhara and other conflict-affected areas, but concerned governments have not publicly condemned attacks by Ethiopian federal forces nor urged the government to hold those responsible for abuses to account, Human Rights Watch said.

Ethiopia’s international partners, notably the African Union and the European Union, should press for resumed international scrutiny of the human rights situation in Ethiopia in multilateral forums. They should also increase support for health services in Amhara, ensure robust independent human rights monitoring in their agreements with the Ethiopian government, and publicly denounce restrictions on aid and attacks against aid workers.

“Foreign governments and international organizations have sought to return to ‘business as usual’ with the Ethiopian government despite the absence of normality on the ground,” Bader said. “Continued civilian suffering from the conflict in Amhara means much greater international scrutiny is needed in Ethiopia.”",VERY HIGH,20240703T064500Z,Human Rights Watch,Laetitia Bader (deputy Africa director at Human Rights Watch),Ethiopian security forces,"Amhara region, Ethiopia","End attacks on healthcare, strengthen legal protections for medical professionals, increase international scrutiny","Widespread war crimes against medical professionals, patients, and health facilities",Ethiopia,Ongoing conflict between Ethiopian federal forces and Amhara militia (Fano)

(Bangkok) – Cambodian government-aligned unions are harassing and threatening legal action against the labor rights organization Center for Alliance of Labor and Human Rights (CENTRAL) and its leadership following the group’s report on freedom of association violations in Cambodia, Human Rights Watch said today. The report was released with partners from Better Factories Cambodia (BFC), part of the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) Better Work program, which operates in 13 countries, including Cambodia.

The ILO and global brands and retail partners who engage with BFC, including Adidas, C&A, Gap Inc., H&M, Inditex, and Nike, should urge the Cambodian authorities to cease efforts to intimidate or censor CENTRAL and its leadership and engage with the report’s recommendations to improve the program.

“The smearing and judicial harassment of CENTRAL for their work on freedom of association for workers and unions threatens not just labor rights but all critical reporting by civil society in Cambodia,” said Bryony Lau, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The ILO, Better Factories Cambodia, and the brands who rely on their reporting should condemn efforts to hinder their work.”

CENTRAL’s report, “Barriers to Representation: Freedom of Association in Cambodia - an assessment of Better Factories Cambodia’s FOA compliance monitoring,” released on June 4, 2024, includes findings from a series of focus group discussions with 78 union representatives from 24-factory level unions in 22 factories in December 2022. These discussions were held with union representatives affiliated with the Cambodian Alliance of Trade Unions and the Coalition of Cambodia Apparel Worker Democratic Unions. In June 2023, the researchers also carried out a small-scale survey with local union representatives from 14 factories registered with the ILO-BFC program.

The report provides important “shadow data” and documents obstructions to freedom of association, including verbal intimidation, threats, harassment, and blacklisting, which it says have “severely” affected independent unions’ ability to function. It also includes workers’ knowledge about BFC compliance data, including the digital literacy of factory-level union representatives and workers, their ability to find the monitoring program’s summary findings online, the inability of unions to purchase the program’s full findings (priced at US$1,500 per report), and the barriers independent unions experience in engaging constructively in factory-level Performance Improvement Consultative Committees.

CENTRAL makes concrete recommendations regarding the ways the ILO-BFC could improve its program, including through more robust disclosures, making its full reports available to workers, and introducing a specialized grievance-redress mechanism for ILO-BFC factories on inaccurate monitoring data. Such measures are important to ensure constructive dialogue to better protect workers’ freedom of association and improve the ILO-BFC program, including its Transparency Database, which reports information about a range of compliance issues, including freedom of association.

BFC is a joint program of the International Finance Corporation, a World Bank Group institution that promotes the private sector in developing countries, and the ILO. Publicly available documents from this year’s International Labour Conference, which took place between June 3-14 in Geneva, indicate that the ILO is concerned about severe problems workers and trade unions face in Cambodia, including “serious violations of basic civil liberties essential to the exercise of freedom of association … violence, intimidation, arrest and imprisonment of trade unionists for carrying peaceful industrial action.”

Following publication of the report, many unions widely considered to be government-aligned have initiated an apparently coordinated effort to urge Cambodia’s Interior Ministry to investigate CENTRAL’s operations and finances, participating in protests on June 14 and June 20 outside CENTRAL’s office. They accused CENTRAL of “damaging the country’s international reputation” and “impacting the national economy and the welfare of workers, purportedly at the behest of foreign donors.”

Three government-aligned unions have also filed unwarranted complaints with the Interior Ministry, requesting investigations of CENTRAL and its leadership.

On June 27, the government-aligned Cambodian Confederation of Workers Rights Protection Unions, filed a complaint at the Phnom Penh Municipal Court, the first of three complaints directed at CENTRAL. It alleged that CENTRAL’s program manager, Tharo Khun had publicly defamed it and accused him of incitement to discrimination, a crime that carries a one to three-year prison sentence. The complaint against Tharo’s alleged comments do not fit the definition of incitement to discriminate under article 496 of Cambodia’s criminal code. Cambodia’s incitement law is problematic and has been found by the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention to be inconsistent with international human rights standards. During a 2022 UN Human Rights Committee dialogue, a committee expert also expressed concern at the number of people who had been imprisoned under the criminal code provisions on incitement, insult, and defamation in the past five years.

On June 27, 44 civil society and community groups issued a joint statement against the Interior Ministry’s decision to investigate CENTRAL as a “clear reprisal and an attempt to intimidate an NGO [nongovernmental organization] that is committed to improving the freedom of association for all Cambodian workers and unions.” The statement also calls on the ILO, the International Finance Corporation, and BFC “to publicly acknowledge the value of critical research in improving its programmes’ operation and implementation.”

On June 28, Interior Minister Sar Sokha issued a letter to the executive director of CENTRAL, Moeun Tola, demanding information about all its bank accounts in Cambodia within 30 days. This action foreshadows an arbitrary investigation into CENTRAL’s activities and its compliance with its bylaws under Cambodia’s highly criticized Law on Associations and NGOs. The consequences for CENTRAL could be dire, potentially leading to its registration being revoked, Human Rights Watch said.

On June 30, the government-aligned National Labour Confederation of Cambodia also submitted the second of three complaints in the form of a petition to the Interior Minister, urging an expedited investigation and legal action against CENTRAL and reportedly stating that if CENTRAL fails to retract its report as “demanded by numerous union leaders,” the confederation would consider taking legal action against it.

On July 2, a government-aligned union, National Trade Union Coalition submitted the third of three complaints to the Ministry of Interior, demanding the ministry investigate CENTRAL’s June 4 report and the organization’s activities and alleging that the report lacked clear sources and evidence, was not scientifically researched, and defamed the freedom of trade unions in Cambodia.

CENTRAL have previously faced direct and indirect threats in the past but this particular smear campaign is unique in that it appears to be a coordinated attack to force them to change their reporting or risk facing legal action or being shut down.

In May 2024, a number of UN member states also made recommendations at the UN Human Rights Council, calling on Cambodia to ensure an enabling environment for civil society, labor groups, and freedom of association, including the improvement of working conditions and labor standards.

“Cambodia’s Ministry of Interior should make clear that reporting on freedom of association is not an illegal activity and is no basis for punitive investigations into the operations of labor rights organizations,” Lau said. “Governments, embassies, and global brands invested in Cambodia’s garment, footwear, and travel goods sector should speak out against government harassment of CENTRAL and promote freedom of association, independent labor advocacy, and the security of rights defenders in Cambodia.”",HIGH,20240703T021500Z,Cambodian government-aligned unions,"Tharo Khun (CENTRAL’s program manager), Moeun Tola (CENTRAL's executive director)",Center for Alliance of Labor and Human Rights (CENTRAL),"Phnom Penh, Cambodia",Urging the ILO and global brands to support labor rights and condemn harassment of CENTRAL.,Harassment and legal threats against CENTRAL for reporting on freedom of association violations,Cambodia,Government alignment with unions; restrictions on civil society and labor rights

Throughout its Universal Periodic Review – a state-to-state rights review process at the United Nations Human Rights Council that concluded today – the Chinese government issued blanket denials in the face of well-documented and egregious rights violations in Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong, and across mainland China and dismissed recommendations on ending such abuses.

China rejected all calls to implement the recommendations of the landmark 2022 UN report on Xinjiang, concluding that abuses against Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim groups in the region may amount to crimes against humanity, dismissing the well-founded report as “illegal and void.”

Such outright refusal to meaningfully address allegations of crimes against humanity is no surprise but should be of grave concern to all UN member states.

China was also disdainful in the face of other grave concerns, rejecting recommendations from a range of countries to end reprisals against human rights defenders, to repeal and cease use of the Hong Kong national security law, and to end arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, and residential surveillance.

However, a few less direct recommendations that offered no rebuke but requested the protection of rights were accepted. These include Gambia’s recommendation to “reinforce the safeguarding of ethnic and religious minorities’ rights by promoting the preservation of cultural identities,” Indonesia’s to “strengthen protection of freedom of religion or belief,” and Estonia’s to “enable all members of civil society to freely engage with international human rights mechanisms without fear of intimidation or reprisals.” These countries should follow up on these recommendations and push for their implementation, which would represent a reversal of current Chinese government policy.

Now that the review has concluded, it is time for robust collective follow-up.

Nearly two years since the UN report on Xinjiang, UN rights chief Volker Türk should provide a public update on the situation. He should also do more to shed light on the worsening situation in Tibet.

Countries from all regions should work together to advance recommendations made by over 50 UN experts and hundreds of rights groups from around the world to hold the Chinese government accountable for its abuses, including convening a dedicated discussion at the Human Rights Council and launching a probe to further investigate and report on serious abuses.

Workers would have to submit their leave or departure requests through the Ministry of Interior’s “Metrash” online portal at least five days ahead of their proposed date of departure. They would be allowed to appeal if their employer did not approve their request.

If the motion is accepted, Qatari authorities risk severely backtracking on their labor reforms introduced in 2020. Under these reforms, Qatar extended a 2018 reform that removed an exit permit requirement for migrant workers to leave the country to include domestic workers.

Although a marked improvement, the 2020 reforms were far from perfect and still required domestic workers to inform employers about their wish to leave Qatar at least 72 hours in advance. This is a glaring flaw of the reform, especially for those in abusive or exploitative situations or who fear retaliation. Human Rights Watch stressed that abusive employers, after receiving notice of their employee’s intent to leave, could retaliate by confining the worker to the house or filing trumped-up criminal charges against them.

Instead of removing this notification requirement, the new Shura Council motion would make it even more difficult for domestic workers to leave the country and put them at greater risk of exploitation and abuse.

Additional measures proposed by the Shura Council would further penalize and endanger domestic workers, among them: making domestic workers who their employers have reported as “absconded,” or those housing or employing them, responsible for deportation expenses; increasing penalties against runaway domestic workers and those who provide them shelter and employment; and preventing workers reported as absconding from transferring their sponsorship.

(Bangui) – The Special Criminal Court (SCC) in the Central African Republic has announced that on June 16, 2024, it arrested a former anti-balaka leader, Edmond Beïna, for crimes committed in 2014, Human Rights Watch said today. The arrest is a step toward assuring justice for victims of serious crimes in the country.

The court confirmed the arrest on June 21. The court charged Beïna with crimes against humanity and war crimes allegedly committed in Guen, Gadzi, and Djomo, in the Mambéré-Kadéï province in the southwestern part of the country, in February and March 2014. Anti-balaka groups under the command of Beïna and a fellow armed group leader, Matruin Kombo, attacked civilians, killing at least 72 Muslim men and boys, some as young as 9, in attacks on February 1 and 5, 2014. The court arrested Kombo in November 2022. In addition to Kombo and Beïna, three other co-accused are detained by the court, charged with crimes arising out of the same facts.

“To date, there has been no accountability for the horrendous crimes committed in Guen, and impunity continues in the Central African Republic,” said Lewis Mudge, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “The Special Criminal Court can change that narrative and finally deliver some justice to victims and their families who have been waiting for so long.”

The SCC was established to investigate and prosecute serious international crimes committed in the Central African Republic since 2003. It is based in Bangui, the capital and is staffed by national and international judges and personnel. It began its operations in 2018.

The anti-balaka militias rose up across the country to fight the Seleka, a predominantly Muslim coalition that took control of Bangui on March 24, 2013. The anti-balaka quickly began to target Muslim civilians, particularly in the west, equating them with Seleka or the coalition’s sympathizers.

In March 2014, a Human Rights Watch researcher spent several days in the country, speaking with survivors of the Guen and Djomo attacks. The victims, all Muslims and mostly elderly women and children, had sought refuge at a Catholic parish, where they were attacked.

The father of 10-year-old Oumarou Bouba said:

“I took my son when the anti-balaka attacked. As we were running away, he was shot by the anti-balaka. He was shot in the right leg and he fell down, but they finished him off with a machete. I had no choice but to run on. I had been shot too. I later went to see his body and he had been struck in his head and in the neck.”

On February 5, after looting Guen’s Muslim neighborhoods, the anti-balaka attacked a property where hundreds of Muslims had sought refuge. In this attack, the anti-balaka divided approximately 45 men into two groups, led them out of the compound, forced them to lie on the ground, and executed them.

Witnesses said that on March 6, the anti-balaka, under the command of Beïna and Kombo, went to the parish searching for the local imam from Djomo, Abdoulaye Liman, who had sought refuge at the parish, and killed him.

The Guen massacre demonstrated the utter lawlessness of the anti-balaka, the urgent need at the time for peacekeepers to act quickly to protect civilians, and the importance now—10 years on—to enforce the rule of law and deliver justice, Human Rights Watch said.

Beïna’s arrest comes as the SCC has made progress on some important cases. In October 2022, the court convicted three members of the 3R rebel group for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in May 2019 in the northwestern part of the country. The conviction was confirmed on appeal in July 2023.

The court’s second trial started in December 2023 and is ongoing. It relates to alleged crimes committed by factions of the Popular Front for the Renaissance of the Central African Republic (Front populaire pour la renaissance de la Centrafrique, FPRC), an armed group, in 2020 in the town of Ndele. Another trial for crimes allegedly committed by the group in Ndele in 2020 started in June 2024. In September 2023, the SCC also announced charges against Abdoulaye Hissène, an FPRC leader, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in 2017; he remains in pretrial detention.

At the same time, the SCC continues to face challenges, including arresting some suspects. In May, the court issued an arrest warrant for former president François Bozizé, who is charged with crimes against humanity allegedly committed between February 2009 and March 23, 2013, by the Presidential Guard and other security services at a military training center north of Bangui. Bozizé, who returned to the country in 2019 as it was wracked with conflict and later emerged as a key leader in a rebel coalition, is currently hiding in Guinea-Bissau.

The current minister of livestock and animal health, Hassan Bouba, was arrested on November 19, 2022, on war crimes and crimes against humanity charges. He was escorted out of detention by national gendarmes in defiance of court orders on November 26, 2022, and failed to appear before the court.

While the security situation in the country has improved over the past decade, impunity for those responsible for serious crimes continues to fuel recurring cycles of violence, and armed groups continue to commit atrocities, leaving trails of death, displacement, and destitution.

The SCC plays an important role in ensuring justice for attacks on civilians over the past decade, like those at Guen or on camps for the internally displaced. The government and the court’s international partners should step up their efforts to support the court to ensure that it can effectively deliver on its crucial mandate, including through adequate resources and the prompt execution of pending arrest warrants, Human Rights Watch said.

“If adequately supported, the Special Criminal Court holds the promise of delivering justice for victims of the most serious crimes,” Mudge said. “Beïna’s arrest and charging show that justice, no matter how long it takes, will be served, and this is a clear warning to others who continue to commit atrocities in the Central African Republic.”",HIGH,20240702T220000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Edmond Beïna, Matruin Kombo, Abdoulaye Liman",Edmond Beïna and anti-balaka groups,"Guen, Gadzi, and Djomo, Mambéré-Kadéï province",Enhance support for the SCC to improve justice delivery and enforce the rule of law.,Crimes against humanity and war crimes,Central African Republic,Ethnic and religious tensions exacerbated by armed clashes

Alleged crimes by former Afghan government officials and United States security force personnel have also not been subject to formal investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC). When opening the court’s probe in Afghanistan in 2021, ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan announced he would focus on abuses committed by the Taliban and the Islamic State Khorasan Province armed group and deprioritize investigations into the former government and US forces, raising concerns about double standards in victims’ access to justice.

Last week, some 70 political figures from the former Afghan government met in Vienna to condemn the Doha meeting and call for an inclusive political process. However, they lost moral ground by including in their ranks individuals who themselves should be investigated for serious abuses. They include politicians like Mohammed Mohaqiq, whose militia forces were responsible for massacres and rapes in the early 2000s but who travels freely in Europe without fear of arrest. Also traveling the globe is former defense minister Asadullah Khalid, who has been implicated in the torture of detainees, extrajudicial killings, and rape. He has frequently visited the US and recently obtained a state of Dominica “golden passport.”

The Afghan human rights group Rawadari has called on states to use universal jurisdiction to bring Afghan leaders suspected of serious crimes, whether Taliban or former officials, to justice in countries where they live or travel. Under this legal principle, national courts can pursue cases for serious crimes regardless of where they were committed and the nationality of either perpetrator or victim. A few countries, notably the Netherlands, have done so against human rights abusers in the past.

A deeply problematic bill for a new Criminal Code is now approaching final approval in the Dominican Republic's Senate. The bill, which the Senate approved on first review on June 26, maintains the country's complete ban on abortion. It also reduces penalties for sexual violence within marriage, classified as ‘non-consensual sexual activity,’ and continues to exclude sexual orientation from the list of characteristics protected from discrimination, thus failing to afford equal protection to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people.

The Dominican Republic is one of only five countries in Latin America and the Caribbean that maintains a total prohibition on abortion and imposes incarceration for women and girls seeking abortions, as well as for those performing them. For decades, women's rights organizations have called for access to safe and legal abortion.

Local organizations have urged Congress to amend the penal code to legalize abortion under three circumstances: when the woman’s life is at risk, when the pregnancy is not viable, or in cases of rape or incest. They also call for amendments that protect LGBT people against discrimination and protect women and girls from all forms of violence, including sexual violence within marriage.

The criminalization of abortion is incompatible with the Dominican Republic's international human rights obligations. Denying girls, women, and other pregnant people’s access to abortion is a form of discrimination that jeopardizes human rights including to life; health; freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment; nondiscrimination; privacy; and access to information. Human rights treaty bodies have consistently urged the Dominican Republic to decriminalize abortion entirely, or at minimum, to ensure safe and legal access when the health of the pregnant woman or girl is threatened and for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest or involving severe fetal impairment.

Decriminalizing abortion is an urgent public health and human rights imperative.

Here we go again. Since shortly after the beginning of Syria’s civil war, countries faced with the prospect of hosting Syrian refugees have touted the idea of “safe areas” within Syria to which refugees could be returned, despite the fact that such zones historically have frequently been unsafe, even treacherous. Turkey has tried to carve out such an area, which is demonstrably among the most dangerous places in the country. Not to be deterred, some European Union countries are at it again.

The Czech Republic is reportedly organizing a fact-finding mission to establish a safe zone in Syria that would enable EU countries to deport Syrian refugees to a supposed safe spot there where they won’t be harmed. They have their eyes on Damascus and Tartous, both in government-held areas. The article reporting on it says the mission “may also involve Cyprus, which has pushed to establish so-called safe zones in Syria for those returning.”

Cyprus is not waiting for the results of any fact-finding mission but has already been pushing back boats of Syrian refugees to Lebanon, whose armed forces have a record of summarily deporting Syrians to Syria. Cyprus has also suspended asylum processing for all Syrians in Cyprus. Cyprus has simply closed its eyes to the reality that the very same Syrian government that caused more than half a million deaths and 12 million people to be forcibly displaced since 2011 is still in power.

Let’s be clear: in a country with a purely localized threat, in which the central government is not implicated, it might be reasonable to expect an internally displaced person to seek refuge within government-controlled areas of their own country before seeking asylum outside the country.

That is not the case in Syria.

Syria’s central government of President Bashar al-Assad is the persecutor, and while it may not exercise effective control across all the country, there is not a safe zone anywhere within it – government controlled or not.

(Sydney) – Personal photos of Australian children are being used to create powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools without the knowledge or consent of the children or their families, Human Rights Watch said today. These photos are scraped off the web into a large data set that companies then use to train their AI tools. In turn, others use these tools to create malicious deepfakes that put even more children at risk of exploitation and harm.

“Children should not have to live in fear that their photos might be stolen and weaponized against them,” said Hye Jung Han, children’s rights and technology researcher and advocate at Human Rights Watch. “The Australian government should urgently adopt laws to protect children’s data from AI-fueled misuse.”

Analysis by Human Rights Watch found that LAION-5B, a data set used to train popular AI tools and built by scraping most of the internet, contains links to identifiable photos of Australian children. Some children’s names are listed in the accompanying caption or the URL where the image is stored. In many cases, their identities are easily traceable, including information on when and where the child was at the time their photo was taken.

One such photo features two boys, ages 3 and 4, grinning from ear to ear as they hold paintbrushes in front of a colorful mural. The accompanying caption reveals both children’s full names and ages, and the name of the preschool they attend in Perth, in Western Australia. Information about these children does not appear to exist anywhere else on the internet.

Human Rights Watch found 190 photos of children from all of Australia’s states and territories. This is likely to be a significant undercount of the amount of children’s personal data in LAION-5B, as Human Rights Watch reviewed fewer than 0.0001 percent of the 5.85 billion images and captions contained in the data set.

The photos Human Rights Watch reviewed span the entirety of childhood. They capture intimate moments of babies being born into the gloved hands of doctors and still connected to their mother through their umbilical cord; young children blowing bubbles or playing instruments in preschools; children dressed as their favorite characters for Book Week; and girls in swimsuits at their school swimming carnival.

The photos also capture First Nations children, including those identified in captions as being from the Anangu, Arrernte, Pitjantjatjara, Pintupi, Tiwi, and Warlpiri peoples. These photos include toddlers dancing to a song in their Indigenous language; a girl proudly holding a sand goanna lizard by its tail; and three young boys with traditional body paint and their arms around each other.

Many of these photos were originally seen by few people and previously had a measure of privacy. They do not appear to be possible to find through an online search. Some photos were posted by children or their family on personal blogs and photo- and video-sharing sites. Other photos were uploaded by schools, or by photographers hired by families to capture personal moments and portraits. Some of these photos are not possible to find on the publicly accessible versions of these websites. Some were uploaded years or even a decade before LAION-5B was created.

Human Rights Watch found that LAION-5B also contained photos from sources that had taken steps to protect children’s privacy. One such photo is a close-up of two boys making funny faces, captured from a video posted on YouTube of teenagers celebrating Schoolies week after their final exams. The video’s creator took precautions to protect the privacy of those featured in the video: Its privacy settings are set to “unlisted,” and the video does not show up in YouTube’s search results.

YouTube’s terms of service prohibit scraping or harvesting information that might identify a person, including images of their faces, except under certain circumstances; this instance appears to violate these policies. YouTube did not respond to our request for comment.

Once their data is swept up and fed into AI systems, these children face further threats to their privacy due to flaws in the technology. AI models, including those trained on LAION-5B, are notorious for leaking private information; they can reproduce identical copies of the material they were trained on, including medical records and photos of real people. Guardrails set by some companies to prevent the leakage of sensitive data have been repeatedly broken.

Moreover, current AI models cannot forget data they were trained on, even if the data was later removed from the training data set. This perpetuity risks harming Indigenous Australians in particular, as many First Nations peoples restrict the reproduction of photos of deceased people during periods of mourning.

These privacy risks pave the way for further harm, Human Rights Watch said. Training on photos of real children enables AI models to create convincing clones of any child, based on a handful of photos or even a single image. Malicious actors have used LAION-trained AI tools to generate explicit imagery of children using innocuous photos, as well as explicit imagery of child survivors whose images of sexual abuse were scraped into LAION-5B.

Likewise, the presence of Australian children in LAION-5B contributes to the ability of AI models trained on this data set to produce realistic imagery of Australian children. This substantially amplifies the existing risk children face that someone will steal their likeness from photos or videos of themselves posted online and use AI to manipulate them into saying or doing things that they never said nor did.

In June 2024, about 50 girls from Melbourne reported that photos from their social media profiles were taken and manipulated using AI to create sexually explicit deepfakes of them, which were then circulated online.

Fabricated media have always existed, but required time, resources, and expertise to create, and were largely unrealistic. Current AI tools create lifelike outputs in seconds, are often free, and are easy to use, risking the proliferation of nonconsensual deepfakes that could recirculate online forever and inflict lasting harm.

LAION, the German nonprofit organization that manages LAION-5B, confirmed on June 1 that the data set contained the children’s personal photos found by Human Rights Watch, and pledged to remove them. It disputed that AI models trained on LAION-5B could reproduce personal data verbatim. LAION said, “We urge the HRW to reach out to the individuals or their guardians to encourage removing the content from public domains, which will help prevent its recirculation.”

Mark Dreyfus, Australia’s attorney general, recently introduced a bill in parliament banning the nonconsensual creation or sharing of sexually explicit deepfakes of adults, noting that such imagery of children would continue to be treated as child abuse material under the Criminal Code. However, Human Rights Watch said that this approach misses the deeper problem that children’s personal data remains unprotected from misuse, including the nonconsensual manipulation of real children’s likenesses into any kind of deepfake.

In August, Australia’s government is set to introduce reforms to the Privacy Act, including drafting Australia’s first child data protection law, known as the Children’s Online Privacy Code. This Code should protect the best interests of the child, as recognized in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and their full range of rights in the collection, processing, use, and retention of children’s personal data, Human Rights Watch said.

The Children’s Online Privacy Code should prohibit scraping children’s personal data into AI systems. It should also prohibit the nonconsensual digital replication or manipulation of children’s likenesses. And it should provide children who experience harm with mechanisms to seek meaningful justice and remedy.

Australia’s government should also ensure that any proposed AI regulations incorporate data privacy protections for everyone, and especially for children.

“Generative AI is still a nascent technology, and the associated harm that children are already experiencing is not inevitable,” Han said. “Protecting children’s data privacy now will help to shape the development of this technology into one that promotes, rather than violates, children’s rights.”",HIGH,20240704T053000Z,Human Rights Watch,Hye Jung Han,Companies using LAION-5B data set,Various locations in Australia,"Adopt laws to protect children's data privacy, enforce regulations against scraping personal data, create mechanisms for justice for harmed children.",Unauthorized use of children's personal photos to create AI tools and deepfakes,Australia,"Lack of laws protecting children's data from AI misuse, exploitation of personal images"

The African Union Commission and its specialized agency on girls and women’s education is currently hosting a conference in Addis Ababa with government ministers, education experts, and civil society representatives to accelerate progress on girls’ and women’s education.

Fifty-one million girls are out of school across Africa. Globally, nine of the ten countries with the highest education exclusion rates for girls are in sub-Saharan Africa, according to recent UNESCO data.

It is encouraging that issues faced by pregnant and parenting students are firmly on the agenda. One in every five girls in Africa is pregnant before age 19. Thousands of girls who are pregnant or parenting are not in school. Girls often face insurmountable barriers to staying in school, which leads to low school retention and even lower completion.

Girls experience the consequences of prevailing negative and discriminatory policies, and attitudes often push them to end their education abruptly. Human Rights Watch’s comprehensive index shows mixed practices in how AU member countries hinder or protect girls’ right to education. While most African countries have policies related to pregnant or parenting students, the responses of many governments are lacking. To address girls’ needs, governments should find an approach that binds education, health, and social protection systems to adequately support girls who are bearing the brunt of becoming parents at a very young age.

This is where the African Union plays a key role: it should tap into its convening power and ability to propose AU-wide policy frameworks to guide member states in effectively implementing human rights obligations.

At the Addis Ababa conference, AU institutions, including its human rights bodies, should encourage African governments to proactively examine education policy frameworks and their implementation in schools. They should also heed calls for the AU to work on a continental framework to guide governments on the rights of girls who are pregnant or parenting. The AU and other education actors supporting African governments should encourage all governments to adopt robust human rights-compliant policy frameworks to guide school officials, teachers, and others working in the education system.",HIGH,20240704T053000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Ministers, education experts, civil society representatives",African Union member states,"Kibera slums, Nairobi, Kenya",Adopt robust human rights-compliant policy frameworks to support pregnant and parenting girls in education.,Barriers to education for pregnant and parenting girls,Kenya,Negative and discriminatory policies and attitudes towards girls

New judiciary guidelines in China specify that crimes of secession by Taiwanese “separatists” are punishable under Chinese law. The guidelines authorize the use of trials in absentia and even the death penalty for anyone asserting Taiwan’s independence.

The People’s Republic of China since its founding in 1949 has never ruled Taiwan and has no jurisdiction over Taiwan, which is democratically governed.

The guidelines regarding Taiwanese “separatists” are stark reminders that the Chinese government routinely threatens Taiwan and its 23 million inhabitants and has expanded its aggressive efforts to stifle their basic freedoms.

China’s 2005 Anti-Secession Law made vague threats of using “other measures” against “Taiwanese secessionist forces” without specifying what constituted “secessionist.” The new guidelines make a criminal offense anything related to Taiwanese independence, including “establishing a ‘Taiwan Independence’ separatist organization,” “promoting Taiwan’s entrance into international organizations,” and deviating from the Chinese narrative of Taiwan “in fields such as education, culture, history, or news media.” Other overly broad offenses include “conduct seeking to separate Taiwan from China” and “otherwise actively participat[ing]” in Taiwanese “separatist organizations.”

The guidelines threaten in absentia trials with no statute of limitations for those who evade being tried. They also do not differentiate between Taiwanese and foreign nationals.

The new guidelines also threaten the death penalty for “crimes” considered “especially serious or … vile.” The Chinese government carries out the most executions in the world, although the exact number remains a state secret. Human Rights Watch opposes the death penalty in all circumstances because of its inherent cruelty.

Taiwan has raised its alert levels for Taiwanese nationals traveling to China, citing recent cases of arbitrary arrests, detention, and interrogations. These new guidelines are likely to have a further chilling effect on the approximately 150,000 Taiwanese nationals living in China, for whom self-censorship is routine.

The new court guidelines are the Chinese government’s latest effort to control people’s right to freedom of expression beyond its borders.

(Sydney) – Australian leaders should discuss human rights issues with Indonesian President-elect Prabowo Subianto Djojohadikusumo during meetings in Canberra on August 20, 2024, Human Rights Watch said today. Australia should seek commitments from Prabowo to uphold religious freedom, protect Indigenous and religious minorities, and revise government policies that discriminate against women and girls, people living with disabilities, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people.

Prabowo, presently Indonesia’s defense minister, won the presidential election on February 14, along with outgoing President Joko Widodo’s son, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, as his vice presidential running mate. He is in Canberra in advance of his inauguration on October 20 to discuss a defense pact between Indonesia and Australia, which will be signed later in Jakarta. But he will also meet with the Australian prime minister and foreign minister.

“Australian government leaders should urge Prabowo to fulfill the human rights-related commitments that previous Indonesian administrations had made but failed to meet,” said Daniela Gavshon, Australia director at Human Rights Watch. “These include some difficult issues such as the mandatory hijab rules, the crackdown on LGBT people, and the government’s unwillingness to allow foreign journalists and United Nations officials to visit West Papua.”

Prabowo, 72, is a former son-in-law of Soeharto, Indonesia’s authoritarian president from 1965 to 1998. Prabowo, a former special forces commander, was dismissed from the Indonesian army in 1998 for kidnapping student activists. Earlier, he had been indicted for the Kraras massacre in East Timor in 1983 but failed to answer a summons from the UN Special Prosecutor’s Office in Dili. A UN-sponsored report on East Timor accused him of commanding massacres that resulted in the deaths of as many as 200 Timorese men, accusations that Prabowo denied.

In their meetings with Prabowo, Australian leaders should set out key human rights expectations, Human Rights Watch said. These should include delivering on human rights commitments made by previous Indonesian governments, including those made to the UN Human Rights Council during Indonesia’s Universal Periodic Review, and implementing the recommendations of UN human rights bodies. Indonesia should also issue a standing invitation to UN experts to visit Indonesia.

Australian leaders should also raise concerns about the deteriorating human rights situation in the Indonesian provinces of West Papua. Ongoingabuses against Indigenous Papuans include killings, enforced disappearances, torture, and mass displacement of people. The UN estimated that since the escalation of violence in December 2018 between Indonesian security forces and West Papuan militants, some 60,000 to 100,000 Papuans have been displaced. The authorities arrested nearly 250 people for joining protests against racism and discrimination against Papuans across over 30 cities in West Papua in 2019. At least 100 were jailed for “treason” between 2019 and 2022.

Australia’s leadership should urge Prabowo to renew the Indonesian government’s 2018 invitation to the UN human rights office to visit West Papua to investigate the human rights situation. A previous meeting was delayed because of disagreements over timing and personnel.

“Australian leaders should not let Prabowo’s egregious rights record deter them from forcefully raising current human rights concerns,” Gavshon said. “They should emphasize that the new president has an important opportunity to restore Indonesia’s standing on West Papua and other human rights issues.”",HIGH,20240820T010000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Prabowo Subianto, Joko Widodo, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, Daniela Gavshon",Prabowo Subianto,"West Papua, Indonesia","Ensure commitments to human rights, allow UN visits, address discrimination against minorities.",Failure to uphold human rights commitments and ongoing abuses in West Papua,Indonesia,"Historical abuses, government policies, authoritarian regime legacy"

This submission is an update to our August 2022 pre-sessional submission and includes updated information on judicial and prosecutorial independence, corruption, and access to abortion and contraception.[1]

This update comes amid challenges to realizing economic, social and cultural rights in Honduras that are reflected in the high level of poverty and inequality as well as lack of access to public services. According to official government data, in 2023, 64 percent of the population lived below the poverty line (down from 73.6 percent in 2021, during the Covid-19 pandemic), and about 41.5 percent lived in extreme poverty (down from 53.7 percent in 2021).[2] Honduras faces one of the highest levels of income inequality in Latin America, with a Gini index of 0.52 in 2023.[3]

Honduras has made progress in developing infrastructure needed to ensure universal access to services such as water, electricity, and sanitation, but still faces significant gaps. National data indicate that while a high percentage of the population has access to piped water (87.5 percent) and public electricity (89 percent), which have slightly improved from 2019, less than half of the people in Honduras have sewer-connected toilets (40 percent) or public garbage collection (47 percent).[4]

Right to Education (articles 13 and 14)

According to UNESCO, Honduras provides three years of free pre-primary education, one year of which is compulsory, and 11 years of free primary and secondary education. UNESCO says that in 2022, the adjusted net enrollment rate in organized learning one year before the official primary education school entry age was 64 percent; with 92 percent of children completing primary education; but only 50 percent completing secondary education.

In 2023, according to government data, working-age Hondurans completed just an average of 7.5 years of schooling, significantly lower than the Latin American average of 10.1.[5] Government expenditure on education in 2023 as a percentage of GDP was 4.44 percent, which is at the lower level of the international target of 4 to 6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) spent on education.

Illiteracy is a significant problem in Honduras. 13.7 percent of people over 15 years old could not read or write in 2023. The data indicate that the illiteracy rate continues to be higher in the rural population.[6]

In July 2024, Honduras co-sponsored, along with 48 other states, a proposal advanced by Luxembourg, the Dominican Republic, and Sierra Leone at the UN Human Rights Council to establish a working group of countries to consider and draft a new optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child explicitly recognizing every child’s right to early childhood education, free public preprimary education, and free public secondary education. The UN Human Rights Council approved the proposal in July.6

Human Rights Watch encourages the Committee to:

Congratulate and thank Honduras for their support of proposals to strengthen the right to free education from pre-primary through secondary under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as a reflection of their obligations under article 2(1) of the Covenant.

Ask the representatives from Honduras why expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP declined between 2019 and 2023, and what activities the government is undertaking to prevent school dropouts.

Right to the Highest Attainable Standard of Health (article 12)

Recent analysis of data from the World Health Organization (WHO) conducted by Human Rights Watch found that more than fifty cents of every dollar spent on health care in the country in 2021 came from out-of-pocket fees levied against individuals and families. The burden of out-of-pocket healthcare spending can create discriminatory barriers to accessing health care based on income and impede the enjoyment of the right to the highest attainable standard of health. But our research suggests that increasing public spending appears to have a strong effect on lowering healthcare systems’ reliance on these kinds of regressive and rights-harming user fees.[7]

Honduras spent the equivalent of 3.44 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on health care through public means in 2021, the most recent year for which data is available. While the government of Honduras' public healthcare spending as a percent of GDP increased by nearly one-fifth from pre-pandemic levels in 2019, it still fell short of the 5-percent-of-GDP public healthcare spending indicator that the WHO uses to assess governments’ funding of public health care, and which is associated with greater achievement towards universal health coverage and related healthcare goals fundamental to the realization of the right to health.[8]

Among 53 lower-middle-income countries included in the WHO’s Sustainable Development Goal 3.8.1 index on coverage of essential health services, Honduras ranked 18th, indicating an opportunity for improvement alongside increased commitment to funding health care. This is similarly reflected in the government of Honduras’ national budget for the year 2021, which allocated roughly 12 percent of spending towards the health sector, placing it among the highest-spending lower-middle-income countries, but still falling short of the 15-percent-of-national-budget benchmark embraced by the African system of human rights.[9]

Human Rights Watch recommends that the Committee call on the government of Honduras to:

Set a goal to spend through domestically generated public funds the equivalent of at least 5 percent of GDP or 15 percent of general government expenditures on health care, or an amount that otherwise ensures the dedication of the maximum available resources for the realization of rights, including the right to health.

Seek to increase public revenues for allocation to public health care through progressive taxes and changes to policy and enforcement to reduce tax abuses.

Judicial and Prosecutorial Independence (article 2)

Honduras’ justice system has suffered political interference for years, and the lack of judicial independence has significant implications for the realization of economic and social rights under the ICESCR.

Every seven years, Congress selects all 15 members of the Supreme Court from a list of at least 45 candidates prepared by a nominating committee. Several sources shared that once the list gets to Congress, in practice, political parties have split the 15 vacancies among them, according to the proportion of seats they hold.[10] In addition, Human Rights Watch was told that when a case involving a political party arrives at the Supreme Court, the case is typically assigned to a justice sympathetic to that party.[11]

In July 2022, under intense domestic and international pressure, Congress adopted a law regulating the functioning of the nominating committee, laying out concrete criteria for the selection of justices and making the process more transparent.[12] In February 2023, Congress appointed 15 new justices selected from a list prepared by the committee, based on merit, but legislators split vacancies among political parties.[13]

Lack of transparency and clear criteria continues to plague the selection of lower-court judges and decisions over their careers. The Supreme Court president has ultimate power over selection, promotion, transfer, and discipline of lower-court judges. We received information on several cases in which candidates had obtained high scores in selection processes, but other candidates with lower scores were appointed instead. Authorities rarely explained the basis for those appointments.[14] The Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the UN special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers have warned that the excessive concentration of power in the Supreme Court is troublesome and that the internal disciplinary system for judges in Honduras lacks independence.[15]

The mechanism to appoint the attorney general lacks transparency and is highly vulnerable to political interference. In November 2023, a Congressional commission, dominated by pro-government legislators, appointed an interim attorney general and deputy attorney general, without the constitutionally required majority vote. [16] Subsequently, in February 2024, following the established legal process, the Congress ratified the attorney general and named a new deputy.[17]

Human Rights Watch recommends that the Committee call on the government of Honduras to:

Introduce a bill to improve the independence of the judiciary, in accordance with international standards,[18]including by: Creating a judicial governance system that includes a fair, transparent, and independent mechanism for disciplinary actions for judges, administered by a body that is separate from the Supreme Court and independent of political and other outside pressures, and establishing that judges may only be suspended or removed for reasons of incapacity or behavior that renders them unfit to discharge their duties; Establishing clear rules for the appointment, transfer, and promotion of judges, based on their qualifications and integrity, and with a commitment to increasing female representation on the Supreme Court;

Ensuring the prompt appointment of tenured judges; and Establishing clear rules for distribution of cases among judges, to prevent conflicts of interest and vulnerability to internal and external pressures.

Seek legal changes, including through introduction of legislative proposals, to modify procedures for appointing the attorney general and other high officials to ensure their selection is transparent and based on clear criteria, including qualifications and evidence of integrity, and to prevent political interference.

Corruption (article 2)

Corruption is a structural problem in Honduras. The Mission to Support the Fight against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH), backed by the Organization of American States (OAS), resulted in several convictions in corruption cases against high-level officials, many involving the alleged embezzlement of funds that had been allocated to programs necessary to protect and fulfill human rights, such as the rights to health, water, and education, and to alleviate poverty. In 2020, the government of former President Juan Orlando Hernández refused to renew its mandate.

Local prosecutors who had worked for MACCIH were integrated into a new prosecutorial unit, Unidad Fiscal Especializada Contra Redes de Corrupción (UFERCO), but they did not receive the same resources and support that they had received for MACCIH and their capacity to investigate corruption plummeted.[19]

Some laws enacted before, during, and after MACCIH that have hindered the fight against corruption and reduced transparency and accountability include:

Decree 418/2013: the so-called official secrets law, which authorities abused to classify, for up to 25 years, a wide array of documents and actions, including budgets and expenses that had nothing to do with national security;[20]

Decree 117/2019: shielding legislators, barring any civil, administrative, and penal sanction against them, for actions that they take in the exercise of their duties as legislators, which has been interpreted broadly in at least one case to close an investigation into alleged forgery of official documents;[21]

Decree 93/2021: weakening the criminal definition of money laundering, by making it harder to prove money laundering when the origin of assets is unknown, allowing dismissal of many cases under investigation;[22] and

Decree 4/2022: granting amnesty to people who were public officials during President Manuel Zelaya’s term in office (2006-2009) and were charged or convicted for “actions related to the exercise of their public function” after the 2009 coup against Zelaya. This provision came as part of a broader amnesty, lauded by human rights organizations, for people charged or convicted “on political grounds” for protesting or defending land and other rights.[23]

President Xiomara Castro signed the repeal of the official secrets law in March 2022.[24] This may help to reinvigorate the Institute for Access to Public Information, which had been unable to provide much information due to the official secrets law.[25]

In December 2022, the Castro administration signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Nations to establish the International Commission against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (CICIH). Between July and October 2023, UN experts conducted three visits to Honduras to assess the viability and legal framework of such a commission. In 2023, Congress abrogated and modified previous decrees – including 57-2020, 116-2019, and 93-2021 – to remove several obstacles which had hampered domestic anti-corruption efforts.[26] However, progress on establishing the CICIH remains slow.[27]

Human Rights Watch recommends that the Committee call on the government of Honduras to:

Collaborate with corruption investigations by providing government information about contracts, spending, and other issues of interest to prosecutors.

Ask Congress to abrogate or amend legislation that has unnecessarily hindered the fight against corruption, including decrees 117/2019, and 4/2022.

Continue to work with UN agencies, donors, and other international actors to establish an anti-corruption commission with a broad mandate that includes: (i) investigation and prosecution of individual corruption cases; (ii) proposal of legislative reforms to strengthen the fight against corruption and the rule of law; (iii) training of Honduran prosecutors, judges, police, and others to fight corruption effectively; (iv) close collaboration with the Consejo Nacional Anticorrupción (CNA), an independent organization mandated by law to fight corruption, and civil society organizations to ensure government accountability for the use of public funds.

Access to Abortion and Emergency Contraception (article 12)

Abortion remains illegal under all circumstances, including when the life of the woman, girl or pregnant person is in danger. People who have abortions, and those who provide them, face up to six years in prison. In 2019, Human Rights Watch documented how Honduras’ total ban on abortion and emergency contraception violates the rights of women and girls and puts their health and lives at risk.[28] In January 2021, Congress passed a constitutional amendment increasing the majority needed to amend the provision banning abortion from two-thirds to three-quarters, complicating future reform.[29] In March 2023, the Supreme Court ruled again that the abortion ban is constitutional, and, in July 2023, President Castro vetoed a law mandating comprehensive sexual education aimed at preventing teenage pregnancies.[30]

In December 2022, President Castro approved a protocol providing a guide for the attention of survivors of sexual violence in health centers which allowed access to emergency contraceptives for these cases.[31] Following this, in March 2023, President Castro signed an executive order that ended the country’s ban on the use and sale of emergency contraception.[32]

However, the Strategic Group on Emergency Contraception (Grupo Estratégico PAE), a coalition of various human rights and healthcare organizations, has reported that emergency contraception is still not available in the public health system, access is not free, nor has the protocol for survivors of sexual violence been implemented.[33] According to Doctors Without Borders, although distribution of kits for sexual assault cases, which contain emergency contraceptives, began after the approval of the protocol in December 2022, they are not being effectively implemented due to the lack of identified health centers and public awareness of where to seek medical assistance. In 2023, they reported 719 cases of sexual violence, but only 12 percent of victims sought help within 72 hours of the event, and emergency contraception was utilized in only 45 of these cases.[34]

The total abortion ban and barriers to accessing emergency contraception are particularly harmful given the country’s high rates of sexual violence, especially among adolescents.

In 2023, the Public Ministry received 2,641 complaints of sexual violence against women and girls. Based on this data, the most affected age groups include girls between the ages of 10-18 (representing 61.5 percent of cases), and women between the ages of 20-29 (21.7 percent).[35]

Honduras has the second highest rate of teenage pregnancies among Latin American countries.[36] In 2024, the adolescent birthrate was 97 per 1,000 girls aged 15-19,[37] higher than the regional average of 61, and more than double the world average.[38] In 2020, 23,180 girls between the ages of 10 and 19 gave birth.[39] While not all these pregnancies are unwanted, adolescents can have more to lose from an unplanned pregnancy – like missing out on school or being pressured to get married – and often have less access than adults to information, resources, and support to be able to safely end a pregnancy.

Abortion bans do not end the practice. Instead, they push women, girls and pregnant people, especially those living in poverty and rural areas, out of the national health system and into unregulated settings. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), lack of access to safe, affordable, timely and respectful abortion care, coupled with the stigma associated with abortion, poses risks to women’s physical and mental well-being throughout their lives.[40]

Fear of criminalization can push women, girls and pregnant people to not seek medical attention when they need it. This was indeed the result for a 22-year-old woman Human Rights Watch spoke to in 2019, who after going to the hospital to treat a miscarriage, was arrested after doctors called the police for a suspected abortion. She was placed under pretrial supervision and waited over two years for her court date.[41]

Human Rights Watch research worldwide shows that criminalizing abortion not only undermines the ability of women and girls to access essential reproductive health services, but it also exacerbates inequalities and discrimination.[42]

In April 2024, the Center for Reproductive Rights and Centro de Derechos de la Mujer lodged a case before the UN Human Rights Committee on behalf of Fausia, an indigenous Honduran woman who became pregnant after being raped in retaliation for her human and environmental rights work. Under Honduras’ total ban on abortion and, at the time, emergency contraception, she was forced to proceed with her pregnancy and faced threats and intimidation while seeking medical assistance.[43]

Human Rights Watch recommends that the Committee call on the government of Honduras to:

Decriminalize abortion as a matter of urgency by removing all criminal penalties for abortion from the criminal code, and ensure all pregnant people have effective access to reproductive healthcare including safe and legal abortion.

Ensure access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health information, psychosocial support for women and girls in the event of unwanted pregnancies, and post-abortion care.

Implement the protocol for the care of survivors of sexual violence and ensure that emergency contraception is accessible in public health services.

Propose a bill, or use its executive powers, to protect patient-doctor confidentiality. No criminal proceeding should be started based on information given while seeking health care.

(Nairobi) – Two human rights defenders who held a news conference to criticize the Democratic Republic of Congo’s “state of siege” in eastern provinces have been held without charge since August 1, 2024, Human Rights Watch said today.

Jack Sinzahera, 35, one of those held, a member of the citizens’ movement Amka Congo (Wake up Congo), is a longtime activist and campaigner who advocates lifting the “state of siege” imposed in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces. Gloire Saasita, 27, also held, is a member of the Génération Positive citizens’ movement, which fights for the defense of human rights in Congo. Neither has been taken before a judge, which Congolese law requires within 48 hours of an arrest. The government should immediately release them.



“Human Rights Watch is deeply concerned for the safety of activists Jack Sinzahera and Gloire Saasita,” said Carine Kaneza Nantulya, deputy Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “Congolese authorities should release them and stop using the ‘state of siege’ to crack down on the rights to free expression and association.”

These arrests occurred at a time when armed conflict in eastern Congo has intensified as Rwandan-backed M23 continue to seize territory around the eastern city of Goma. In May 2021, President Félix Tshisekedi, who was re-elected in December 2023, declared martial law – a “state of siege” – in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces. The military has taken over civilian authority in both provinces since then, and martial law has remained in effect. Armed groups continue to attack civilians with little protection from the Congolese army despite the “state of siege.”



Activists who were at the August 1 news conference told Human Rights Watch that at about 10:45 a.m., Sinzahera and Saasita were in the basketball stadium of Goma's Institut Supérieur de Commerce (Higher Institute of Commerce) giving interviews to journalists when men in civilian clothes approached them. The activists interviewed said they recognized the men as being from the Goma intelligence police, known as P2.

They said one of the men told Sinzahera that they had come to arrest him and another told Saasita: “As you're covering yourself with the country's flag and you're a patriot, you too can come and explain yourself afterwards.” The men put the two activists into a private car and drove away.

A family member and a human rights defender based in Kinshasa, the Congolese capital, told Human Rights Watch that on August 10, the two activists were transferred to the General Directorate of Intelligence (Direction Générale des Renseignements) in Kinshasa. The families said the authorities have not told them the reason for the arrests.

An activist from Goma said he was able to visit once the two activists in custody after paying a bribe. He said that Sinzahera and Saasita told friends when they visited them that they were arrested for criticizing the “state of siege.”

Human Rights Watch previously reported that the military and police have used martial law to curtail freedom of expression, put down peaceful demonstrations with lethal force, and arbitrarily detain and prosecute activists, journalists, and political opposition members.

On April 2, 2022, Mwamisiyo Ndungo, an activist with Lucha, an organization which fights for the protection of rights and freedoms in Congo, was arrested and later convicted and sentenced to five years in prison for criticizing the “state of siege” on his X, formerly Twitter, account. These latest arrests further highlight the government’s growing intolerance toward voices critical of the “state of siege” in North Kivu, Human Rights Watch said.

Under martial law orders, military authorities are able to ban meetings deemed against public order and arrest anyone for disrupting public order. Civilians are prosecuted before military courts, which violates Congo’s obligations under international human rights law to ensure due process and fair trial rights.

Under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Congo is a party, certain rights may be suspended under a state of emergency but must be tailored to the “exigencies of the situation” and be lawful, necessary, and proportionate, including when martial law is in effect.

A portion of the proceeds will benefit Human Rights Watch.

The artworks consist of three series of 99 lithographs released in three colors: “Malibu,” “Sunshine,” and “Peach.” They resemble a geometric tile consisting of surveillance cameras, Twitter birds, and handcuffs to symbolize the struggle for freedom of speech. The “Grass Mud Horse” lithographs are all numbered and signed by Ai Weiwei. The title in Chinese is a homophone for either a mythical animal or a vulgar profanity used to insult a person’s mother. The animal, which resembles a llama, has become a Chinese internet meme as a tongue-in-cheek icon of resistance to censorship by China's online communities.

“Ai Weiwei is an inspiration to people fighting oppression the world over,” said Tirana Hassan, executive director of Human Rights Watch. “We are absolutely thrilled to be working with him again and to partner with JRP|Editions to release his very first lithographic editions.” The lithographs will be released at 12 p.m. ET/6 p.m. CEST on Tuesday, September 10 and can be preordered for CHF 1,500 (roughly US$1,750) each.

Ai Weiwei is the son of a poet who fell out of favor with the Chinese Communist party and was sent to a labor camp. A conceptual artist who fuses traditional craftsmanship and his Chinese heritage, Ai Weiwei’s work often revolves around human rights and democracy themes. The Chinese government held him in a secret police detention center in 2011 without any formal charges and confiscated his passport. In 2015, he left China when his passport was returned.

He previously partnered with Human Rights Watch during the Covid-19 pandemic, printing his artwork on masks in a mass activism project. The project focused on the simple face mask, a ubiquitous form of protection during the pandemic but one that is banned in Hong Kong, where pro-democracy protesters used masks before the emergence of Covid-19 to evade police tear gas and facial recognition technology.

His works of art were printed on the masks, including symbols of free speech, surveillance, persecution, mass obedience, and defiance. This project of mass activism raised $1.4 million for Human Rights Watch’s work on human rights in the pandemic and also benefited two colleague organizations, Refugees International and Médecins sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders).

This new partnership was created under the initiative of Deborah Najar, a cultural strategist, and Helena Bjäringer, Human Rights Watch’s Geneva Committee member, who has been involved in the organization’s Art+Activism initiative, which engages artists, curators, and galleries in the human rights movement.

(Bangkok) – Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar are facing the gravest threats since 2017, when the Myanmar military carried out a sweeping campaign of massacres, rape, and arson in northern Rakhine State, Human Rights Watch said today. August 25, 2024, marks the seventh anniversary since the start of the military’s crimes against humanity and acts of genocide that forced more than 750,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh.

In recent months, the Myanmar military and the ethnic Arakan Army have committed mass killings, arson, and unlawful recruitment against Rohingya communities in Rakhine State. On August 5, nearly 200 people were reportedly killed following drone strikes and shelling on civilians fleeing fighting in Maungdaw town near the Bangladesh border, according to Rohingya witnesses. About 630,000 Rohingya remain in Myanmar under a system of apartheid that leaves them exceptionally vulnerable to renewed fighting.

“Rohingya in Rakhine State are enduring abuses tragically reminiscent of the military’s atrocities in 2017,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Once again, armed forces are driving thousands of Rohingya from their homes with killings and arson, leaving them nowhere safe to turn.”

Rohingya have been caught in the middle of the fighting since hostilities resumed in November 2023, ending a year-long unofficial ceasefire. As the Arakan Army has rapidly expanded its control across Rakhine State, the military has responded with indiscriminate attacks on civilians using helicopter gunships, artillery, and ground assaults. In late April, Arakan Army forces began attacking Rohingya villages in Buthidaung, culminating in their May 17 capture of the town, during which they shelled, looted, and burned Rohingya neighborhoods.

Armed clashes have since moved west to Maungdaw, spurring further abuses and displacement, including arson and looting. Four videos from the August 5 attacks shared on X, formerly Twitter, on August 6 show dozens of bodies of men, women, and children. Geoconfirmed identified the location, which Human Rights Watch corroborated, at the western edge of Maungdaw town. Rohingya witnesses told Human Rights Watch they believed the Arakan Army was responsible. The junta and Arakan Army have blamed each other for the attacks.

“Over the last two months, there was serious fighting between the Arakan Army and Myanmar military, with artillery shells and drones,” said a 24-year-old Rohingya man from Myo Ma Ka Nyin Tan, Maungdaw, in August. “Many Rohingya villagers were killed and injured every day. I went to several funerals.” He fled on August 5 when fighting descended on his neighborhood. “We made our way to the riverbank to cross, where thousands of people were making the journey. Suddenly, drones appeared and started dropping bombs on the crowd. In our group of 70 to 80, close to 20 were killed, and 10 others, including myself, were injured.”

“The Naf River was full of dead Rohingya bodies as we fled,” said another villager, 18, who told Human Rights Watch that his father was killed in a drone attack. “I saw many dead bodies in the paddy fields and on the riverbank.” His boat capsized in the river while crossing into Bangladesh, drowning two dozen people. He and his brother found a plastic barrel which they floated on to the shore. The Border Guard Bangladesh arrested his mother while she attempted to cross the border and have detained her since, he said. Border guards have increased pushbacks of asylum seekers along the Rakhine border since January.

The conflict has displaced more than 320,000 people in Rakhine State and southern Chin State since November 2023. Meanwhile, the junta has ramped up its deadly blockages of humanitarian aid as a form of collective punishment, which is in violation of international humanitarian law and contrary to the 2022 United Nations Security Council resolution and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) five-point consensus.

Rohingya are being pressured from all sides in Myanmar and Bangladesh, Human Rights Watch said. In recent months, the junta has unlawfully recruited thousands of Rohingya men and boys from Rakhine State and the refugee camps in Bangladesh, with support from Rohingya armed groups, inflaming tensions between the Rohingya Muslim and Rakhine Buddhist communities.

In Bangladesh, about one million Rohingya refugees are facing increasingly dire conditions in the Cox’s Bazar camps amid surging violence by armed groups and criminal gangs. In August alone, there have been reports of members of the Rohingya Solidarity Organisation and Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army carrying out killings, abductions, forced recruitment, extortion, and robbery. Bangladesh authorities have failed to ensure refugees access’ to protection, education, livelihoods, and movement.

“My heart aches for the safety of our Rohingya students and the entire community in the area,” a Rohingya teacher in the camps wrote in a note to Human Rights Watch. His students have been increasingly absent from classes, he said, either abducted for ransom, unlawfully recruited, or kept home by their parents out of fear. “Brutal gang activity has created a climate of terror. The fear is palpable, a suffocating weight.”

Bangladesh’s interim prime minister, Muhammad Yunus, said he will “continue to support the million-plus Rohingya people sheltered in Bangladesh,” although his foreign adviser told Reuters that they are not in a position to accept more refugees. Bangladesh is bound by the customary international law prohibition on refoulement not to forcibly return anyone to a place where they would face a threat to life or a real risk of persecution, torture, or other ill-treatment.

Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh have consistently said they want to go home but only when their safety, access to land and livelihoods, freedom of movement, and citizenship rights can be ensured. Since January 2023, more than 5,000 Rohingya have attempted dangerous boat journeys to Indonesia and Malaysia in the hope of a better life. An estimated 520 of them have died or gone missing.

While the international response to the 2017 violence was meager and no one has yet been held to account for the crimes against the Rohingya, there have been some important steps toward justice, Human Rights Watch said. In June, an Argentine prosecutor requested arrest warrants for 25 individuals within the Myanmar political and military authorities. The case was filed under the principle of universal jurisdiction, which allows national authorities to prosecute suspects of grave crimes regardless of nationality or where the crimes were committed.

In July, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) accepted the interventions of seven governments in Gambia’s case against Myanmar under the Genocide Convention. Hearings on the merits of the case will most likely take place in 2025. At the same time, the International Criminal Court (ICC) has an ongoing investigation into the situation, although its jurisdiction is limited to alleged crimes committed at least in part in Bangladesh, an ICC member country.

The UN Security Council should expand the ICC’s jurisdiction in the case by referring the situation in Myanmar to the court, Human Rights Watch said. Council members have so far not followed up on the December 2022 resolution with tangible measures, fearing vetoes by China and Russia.

Security Council members should support holding an open meeting to address the deteriorating situation in Rakhine State and build momentum for a follow-up resolution under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. The council should also play a role in enforcing the binding provisional measures ordered by the ICJ in the genocide case, which the military has blatantly disregarded.

“Over the past seven years, UN bodies and governments haven’t done enough to end the system of apartheid and persecution that has exposed Rohingya to further suffering,” Pearson said. “Ending the ongoing cycles of abuses, destruction, and displacement requires international efforts to hold those responsible to account.”",VERY HIGH,20240823T003000Z,Human Rights Watch,Elaine Pearson (Asia director at Human Rights Watch),Myanmar military and Arakan Army,"Rakhine State, Myanmar","Support international legal actions, humanitarian aid, pressure Myanmar for accountability",Crimes against humanity and acts of genocide against Rohingya Muslims,Myanmar,"Historical discrimination against Rohingya, military control, ethnic tensions"

On Tuesday, Australia’s National Children’s Commissioner released a report, “Help way earlier!”, that finds that Australia is failing to protect children’s rights in its criminal justice system.

Commissioner Anne Hollands based her findings on interviews with 150 children and young people who have experienced the system firsthand. The report makes 24 recommendations, including banning solitary confinement for children throughout Australia and raising the age of criminal responsibility to 14. In most parts of Australia today, children as young as 10 can be detained.

The report finds that First Nations children with intergenerational trauma and children with disabilities were too often being criminally prosecuted. Many of these children were experiencing poverty, marginalization, and systemic racism, but their basic needs, such as safe housing, were not being met. Instead, they faced incarceration.

The report also highlighted that that many of the children detained are living with disabilities and mental health conditions, which can be exacerbated by harsh conditions, including solitary confinement.

Previous reports, including the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability, have also made recommendations to ban solitary confinement and raise the age of criminal responsibility. However, most Australian state and territory governments have not acted on these recommendations.

Last week, Victoria’s government announced it had abandoned its plans to raise the age of criminal responsibility to 14 and said it would only raise it from 10 to 12.

No jurisdiction in Australia currently prohibits the use of solitary confinement with children. Solitary confinement is damaging for all prisoners but it is particularly harmful for children and people with disabilities. The stress of a closed and heavily monitored environment, absence of meaningful social contact, and lack of activity can exacerbate trauma and cause long-term, serious, and irreparable harm to children and people with disabilities. In 2018, Human Rights Watch found that people with disabilities in Australian prisons were disproportionately placed in solitary confinement.

The Commissioner’s report concluded that while criminal justice was largely the responsibility of states and territories in Australia, national leadership is needed. It calls on the federal government to introduce a National Children’s Act alongside a Human Rights Act.

Mistreatment at the hands of the criminal justice system can have devastating and even deadly impacts on children. All Australian jurisdictions should respond swiftly and decisively to the Commissioner’s recommendations.",HIGH,20240821T210000Z,National Children’s Commissioner,Commissioner Anne Hollands,Australian state and territory governments,Australia,"Ban solitary confinement for children, raise the age of criminal responsibility to 14, introduce a National Children’s Act and a Human Rights Act",Failure to protect children’s rights in the criminal justice system,Australia,"Intergenerational trauma, systemic racism, poverty, lack of basic needs such as safe housing"

Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan have committed widespread acts of sexual violence in areas of Khartoum over which they exercise control, acts that constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity .

and . Both the RSF and the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) have attacked healthcare workers, local responders, and healthcare facilities, which are war crimes.

The African Union and the United Nations should urgently deploy a civilian protection force, and states should take steps to hold those responsible for sexual violence accountable.

(Nairobi) – Sudan’s warring parties, particularly the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), have committed widespread acts of rape, including gang rape, and forced women and girls into marriages in Khartoum, the country’s capital, since the current conflict’s onset, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today.

The 89-page report, ““Khartoum is Not Safe for Women”: Sexual Violence against Women and Girls in Sudan’s Capital,” documents widespread sexual violence, as well as forced and child marriage during the conflict, in Khartoum and its sister cities. Service providers treating and supporting victims also heard reports from women and girls of being held by the RSF in conditions that could amount to sexual slavery. The research also highlights the devastating health and mental health consequences for survivors and the destructive impact of warring parties’ attacks on health care and the Sudanese Armed Forces’ (SAF) willful blocking of aid.

“The Rapid Support Forces have raped, gang raped, and forced into marriage countless women and girls in residential areas in Sudan’s capital,” said Laetitia Bader, deputy Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “The armed group has terrorized women and girls and both warring parties have blocked them from getting aid and support services, compounding the harm they face and leaving them to feel that nowhere is safe.”

It is of paramount importance to hear directly from sexual violence survivors themselves, their experiences, views, and demands should be heard in a safe and dignified manner. Given restrictions on access to Khartoum, security challenges, lack of services for survivors, and logistical barriers, Human Rights Watch, with a few exceptions, for this report interviewed 42 health care providers, social workers, counsellors, lawyers, and local responders in the emergency response rooms that they have established in Khartoum between September 2023 and February 2024.

Eighteen of the healthcare providers had provided direct medical care or psychosocial support to survivors of sexual violence, or managed individual incidents. They said they had cared for a total of 262 survivors of sexual violence from ages 9 through 60 between the conflict’s onset in April 2023 and February 2024.

“I have slept with a knife under my pillow for months in fear from the raids that lead to rape by RSF,” a 20-year-old woman living in an area controlled by the RSF told Human Rights Watch in early 2024. “Since this war started, it is not safe anymore to be a woman living in Khartoum under RSF.”

The physical, emotional, social, and psychological scars left on the survivors are immense, Human Rights Watch found. Healthcare workers encountered survivors seeking assistance for debilitating physical injuries they experienced during rapes and gang rapes. At least four of the women died as a result. Many survivors who sought to terminate pregnancies resulting from rape faced significant barriers to abortion care. Survivors described or showed symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress and depression, including suicidal thoughts, anxiety, fear, and sleeplessness.

“I spoke to a survivor who was raped and had just discovered she was three months pregnant,” a psychiatrist said. “She was clearly traumatized and shivering, afraid of how her family would react. She said to me, ‘If they discover my situation, they will kill me.’”

Survivors told the medical providers that they were raped by as many as five RSF fighters. The RSF have also abducted women and girls and confined them in homes and other facilities they occupied in Khartoum, Bahri, and Omdurman, subjecting them to sexual violence and other abuse. RSF members have sometimes sexually assaulted women and girls in front of their family members. The RSF also forced women and girls into marriages.

Fewer cases were attributed to the Sudanese Armed Forces members, but an uptick in cases was reported after SAF took control of Omdurman in early 2024. Men and boys have also been raped, including in detention.

Both warring parties have blocked survivors’ access to critical and comprehensive emergency health care, Human Rights Watch found.

SAF has willfully restricted humanitarian supplies, including medical supplies, and aid workers’ access, imposing a de facto blockade on medical supplies entering RSF-controlled areas of Khartoum since at least October 2023. The RSF have pillaged medical supplies and occupied medical facilities.

Local responders have been compelled to play the leading role in responding to sexual violence. They are paying a heavy price, as both warring parties have intimidated, arbitrarily detained and attacked doctors, nurses, and emergency care volunteers, including because they support rape survivors. In several instances, RSF members committed sexual violence against the service providers, they said.

Conflict-related sexual violence is a war crime. As is the case with forced marriage, when sexual violence is committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population, as is happening in Sudan, it may also be investigated and prosecuted as a crime against humanity, Human Rights Watch said.

The willful obstruction or arbitrary restriction of humanitarian aid also violates international humanitarian law, and pillaging as well as attacks targeted at civilians, including health care workers and first responders, constitute war crimes. Intentionally directing attacks against humanitarian assistance operations, including personnel, premises, and vehicles, is also a discrete war crime prosecutable under the statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC).

Neither warring party has taken meaningful steps to prevent its forces from committing rape or attacking health care, nor to independently and transparently investigate crimes committed by their forces, Human Rights Watch found. On July 23, the RSF spokesperson wrote to Human Rights Watch rejecting claims that the RSF occupies any hospitals or medical centers in the three cities of Khartoum State. He did not provide evidence that it has carried out effective investigations into allegations of sexual violence by its forces, far less hold any to account.

The African Union and the United Nations should immediately work together to deploy a new mission to protect civilians in Sudan, including preventing sexual and gender-based violence, supporting delivery of comprehensive services to all survivors, and documenting conflict-related sexual violence. The mission should have a mandate and capacity to monitor the obstruction of, and facilitate access to, humanitarian assistance.

International donors need to urgently increase political and financial support to local responders. Countries should work together to impose targeted sanctions on commanders responsible for sexual violence, and attacks on healthcare workers and local responders. UN member states, particularly from the region, should continue to support international investigations into these crimes, including by the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission for Sudan. The United Nations should prioritize ensuring that it rebuilds capacity to respond to conflict related sexual violence across its system.

“Women, men, and children at imminent risk of abuses or who have survived rape in Khartoum and beyond should know that the world is willing to protect them, and guarantee their access to support services and justice,” Bader said. “The United Nations and African Union need to mobilize this protection and states should hold to account those responsible for ongoing sexual violence, attacks on local responders, health facilities, and the blocking of aid.”",HIGH,20240729T074500Z,Human Rights Watch,Laetitia Bader,Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF),"Khartoum, Sudan",Immediate action by international community to protect civilians and document abuse,Widespread sexual violence and attacks on healthcare workers and facilities,Sudan,Conflict between RSF and SAF

Earlier this month, people being detained at California Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities began a labor and hunger strike to protest their conditions, including against the use of solitary confinement. Recent research documented the deep physical and psychological toll wrought by the use of solitary confinement in United States immigration detention centers.

Across the US, carceral facilities lock up over 122,000 people daily in solitary confinement for 22 or more hours a day. In the last five years, ICE alone has locked people in solitary confinement over 14,000 times, often for months on end.

Human Rights Watch has condemned solitary confinement practices in the US, including in immigration detention centers.

From 2018 to 2023, the average period for which ICE detention facilities imposed solitary confinement was 27 days. In hundreds of cases, solitary confinement lasted at least 90 days, and in 42 cases lasted over a year. This violates international standards barring prolonged or indefinite solitary confinement, which amounts to prohibited torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.

UN Special Rapporteur on Torture Juan Méndez has specifically concluded that solitary confinement beyond 15 days constitutes a “form of torture.” The use of solitary confinement for any duration on children and people with psychosocial disabilities also meets these criteria.

For people in US immigration detention, solitary confinement often compounds the effects of previous traumatic experiences. Segregation can cause people’s mental health to deteriorate, and they are unlikely to receive appropriate or timely mental health care. Solitary confinement is linked to anxiety, depression, and psychosis. Even a few days in solitary significantly heightens the risk of death by suicide. A recent report documented dozens of preventable deaths in ICE detention facilities, including many individuals who died by suicide after spending time in solitary confinement.

ICE’s use of solitary confinement disproportionally targets people with psychosocial disabilities and African and Caribbean immigrants. Black immigrants are overrepresented by a factor of 6.8 in solitary confinement cases.

Immigration detention itself should only be used as a tool of last resort, and the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has called for it to be gradually abolished. Imposing solitary confinement is an extreme deprivation of rights that is disproportionate to any legitimate state interest in the immigration detention context.

(Nairobi) – The supreme court of Ghana on July 24, 2024, upheld a colonial-era law that criminalizes adult consensual same-sex conduct, contrary to Ghana’s human rights obligations, Human Rights Watch said today. The judgment comes at a time when the country is engulfed in a debate over a dangerous anti-LGBT law which would take persecution of sexual and gender minorities and their allies even further.

“Ghana’s supreme court unfortunately upheld the British colonial legacy of criminalizing so-called ‘unnatural sex,’” said Rasha Younes, interim lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights director at Human Rights Watch. “The law had been challenged on the grounds that it violated the constitutionally protected rights to privacy and personal liberties, rights that everyone has under international law as well, and regardless of their sexual orientation.”

Ghana’s constitution ensures respect for human dignity, protection of personal liberty, and the right to privacy for all. Yet, violence against LGBT people is prevalent, and persecution has escalated in recent years with debates about the bill.

Prince Obiri-Korang, a law lecturer at the University of Ghana, initiated the suit to overturn the law. Under section 104(1)(b) of Ghana’s Criminal Offences Act 1960 (Act 29), inherited from the British colonial law, “whoever has unnatural carnal knowledge[…]of a person sixteen years or older, with his consent, is guilty of a misdemeanor.” Unnatural carnal knowledge is defined in section 104(1)(2) as “sexual intercourse with a person in an unnatural manner or with an animal.” According to the supreme court judges, “unnatural manner” also includes the use of sex toys.

With this ruling, the court has expanded the interpretation of Section 104(1)(b), apparently adopting language from the anti-LGBT Promotion of Proper Human Sexual Rights and Ghanaian Family Values Bill, 2021, which specifically prohibits a person, in clause four, from engaging in any acts that undermine the proper human sexual rights and Ghanaian family values.

In 2017, while Human Rights Watch was researching the impact of this law, Jones Blantari, chief superintendent of Ghana’s police force, told Human Rights Watch, “the term unnatural carnal knowledge is vague, does not have any clear meaning in law, creates difficulties in consistent interpretation and its application is used to target LGBT people.”

The bill carries heavier criminal penalties for same-sex activities, increasing the maximum penalty from three years to five years in prison, and expands the possibility of extending criminal charges against anyone who identifies as LGBT, queer, pansexual, and any other non-conventional gender identity as well as allies to these communities. It would also punish anyone providing support, funding, or public advocacy for sexual and gender minorities rights.

Members of parliament introduced the bill in 2021. In addition to expanding the possibility of criminal charges against those advocating for LGBT rights, the bill allows for criminal charges against anyone who uses social media platforms to produce, publish, or disseminate content promoting activities prohibited by the bill.

Significant figures in Ghana publicly opposed the bill, including the Roman Catholic Cardinal of Ghana Peter Turkson, and a former member of parliament and major political party chair Samia Nkrumah.Nkrumah urged the president to veto the anti-LGBT bill, calling it “brutal, harsh, and unjust.” Nkrumah’s father, the late Kwame Nkrumah, is a key figure in African and Ghanaian history. In the 1950s and 1960s, he led the independence movement and served as the country’s first president and prime minister.

Recent statements by senior Nigerian government officials and security agencies regarding the planned nationwide protests raise serious concerns. The officials' rhetoric suggests a troubling readiness to stifle dissent, heightening fears of a violent crackdown.

Calls to protest emerged following recent demonstrations in Kenya against increased taxes on essential goods and have gained traction on social media in Nigeria using the hashtag #EndBadGovernance. The Kenyan protests evolved into broader demands for government reforms, which appears to resonate with many Nigerians facing the worst cost of living crisis in nearly 30 years. By June 2024, Nigeria's inflation rate hit 34.19%, with food inflation exceeding 40%.

Organizers of the planned protests, scheduled to begin on August 1, say they are aimed at addressing both economic hardships and longstanding systemic issues, such as corruption.

Media reports quote President Tinubu and senior administration officials labeling the protests as unwarranted and politically motivated. The Department of State Services alleged the protests are intended to undermine the government and create conditions for “regime change” and will be used to incite chaos and violence. Similarly, the military warned that the protests could lead to anarchy and has promised to take proactive measures to maintain control. The police have cautioned against the protests, suggesting they could be used as a cover to unleash terror.

These pre-emptive warnings are troubling, especially given the Nigerian security forces' history of violently repressing peaceful protest. The brutal crackdown of the #EndSARS protests in October 2020, when military and police officers fired on unarmed protesters, killing at least 12, remains fresh in the memory. A recent Economic Community of West Africa Court ruling found that the Nigerian government had violated protesters' rights during the #EndSARS protests.

Rather than undermining the right to protest, authorities should address the underlying issues that are driving the protests.

The European Commission’s annual Rule of Law Report 2024 glosses over serious threats to civil society in the European Union, sending a message that the EU doesn’t take the decline of civic space in its member states seriously enough.

In the report, published July 24, the commission recognizes the essential role civil society plays, but despite mounting evidence, fails to identify intimidation and interference with the work of civil society organizations as a core challenge.

In France, civil society is curtailed by regulations, threats of cuts in state funding, and the dissolution of associations. Excessive force is often used to police protests and environmental activists face stigmatizing rhetoric and harsh penalties for their actions. Although the report praises the financial health of civil society organizations in France, it notes concerns about subsidy withdrawal and stigmatization but does not address these issues in its recommendations.

In Greece and Italy, civil society organizations, especially those working on migrant and asylum seekers’ rights, are heavily obstructed and subjected to criminalization and harassment. The report touches on some of these issues but does not address their full range or severity or direct specific recommendations to the government.

In Hungary, repressive legislation and the vilification of civil society are used to stifle civic engagement, creating a climate of fear and censorship. Even though the report mentions these issues, the commission settles for a generic recommendation to remove obstacles affecting civil society organizations and foster a safe and enabling civic space, instead of providing clear calls for action.

Civic space in Germany has diminished over the past year due to restrictions on protests and assemblies. The commission notes that Germany has not made progress in implementing new regulations to clarify the tax-exempt status of nonprofit organizations, which can negatively impact donations and public funding access. However, its recommendations do not address broader restrictions, such as pre-emptive detention of protesters and blanket protest bans.

The EU’s failure to recognize the significance of the problems facing civil society comes at a time when repressive legislation and intensified crackdowns are on the rise in its surrounding neighborhood. Those governments will only be emboldened by EU inaction at home.

The Tanzanian government by 2021 had devised a plan to relocate about 82,000 Maasai people from their homes and ancestral lands in Arusha region’s Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA) by 2027. The British colonial government had established the NCA, a so-called multiple land use area, in 1959 to create a permanent homeland for the people who lived in and around the Ngorongoro Crater, the vast majority of whom are Indigenous Maasai herders.

In 2022, the government began to systematically reduce the availability and accessibility of essential social services for the residents of the NCA, including by defunding institutions providing those services. At the time, social services in the region were already significantly reduced, less accessible and of generally poorer quality than those elsewhere in the country. The authorities also took steps to restrict residents, who depend primarily on herding livestock for their income, from grazing animals in specified areas of the NCA.

With little or no consultation with affected communities, the government has since resettled and based on its resettlement plan, will continue to relocate people from the NCA to Msomera village in Tanga region’s Handeni district, about 600 kilometers away. The government has provided relocated NCA families with a house and about two to five acres of land to farm, in addition to constructing and renovating roads, a primary school, dispensary, post office, police post, water supply system, electricity, and cellular network to service Msomera.

Between August 2022 and December 2023, Human Rights Watch interviewed nearly 100 people—including NCA residents facing relocation, former NCA residents who have been resettled in Msomera, and existing residents of Msomera—and found that what the government has referred to as its “voluntary relocation plan” from the NCA has been far from voluntary. In implementing their plan, authorities have used tactics that amount to constructive forced eviction in violation of international human rights law and standards. Forced evictions constitute gross violations of a range of internationally recognized human rights, including the human rights to adequate housing, food, water, health, education, work, security of the person, freedom from cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment, and freedom of movement. In resettling those relocated from the NCA, authorities have also effectively evicted residents of Msomera by constructing buildings and other infrastructure, and allotting houses and farmland to the displaced, on land that was already occupied and used by local residents.

The government has not sought the free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) from the Indigenous Maasai residents of the NCA. Community leaders said they were not properly consulted about the government’s resettlement plan, nor did they have access to information on matters related to the relocation process, compensation, what conditions to expect in Msomera, and which villagers were registered for relocation. The lack of free, prior and informed consent meant the authorities have not addressed concerns of residents, and residents have not been given the possibility of engaging with authorities to mitigate harm or protect their rights, whether they choose to relocate from the NCA or remain.

Of particular concern to residents are government measures that are forcing residents out of the NCA. These include the scaling-down of essential infrastructure, including education and health services, restrictions on movement in and out of the NCA, reduced access to pasture, water, and cultural sites, and government-employed rangers assaulting and beating residents with impunity.

The authorities also did not consult Msomera residents on the resettlement plans. Without any input from the affected communities, the government mapped out and built houses on land where Msomera residents have lived and grazed their cattle for decades, forcing them out of the area. These residents have clashed with the newly resettled families from the NCA as access to land for cultivation and pastoralism and to other resources has become increasingly limited. When those already living in Msomera have protested loss of their land, the authorities have threatened them with eviction and arrest.

Maasai who relocated from the NCA to Msomera, a decision some said they made because of government restrictions that made life extremely difficult, struggled as well. One such restriction is that only the head of household, usually understood to be male, registers the family to relocate, thus taking women out of the decision-making process. This exclusion has contributed to a resettlement process that does not reflect the complex nature of Maasai households, many of which are polygamous, multi-generational, and multi-household. Also, the houses provided by government have not met the cultural needs of many households as some new homes are too small for large, multi-generational, multi-household Maasai families. In Msomera, each male head of household is provided one house for his family, but Maasai culture does not permit multiple wives to live in the same house with him. Consequently, some families have had to use some of the insufficient compensation they received from the government to build additional houses to accommodate wives and larger families, and to prepare land for their animals. Some of the relocated people also expressed concerns about having less access to quality water than they did in the NCA.

The government has systematically silenced critics of the relocation process, contributing to a climate of fear among residents and local human rights defenders. Many critics have not spoken out for fear of reprisals from the authorities. The authorities have arrested community activists and denied civil society organizations entry into the NCA. Human Rights Watch found that those allowed in have been closely monitored by government rangers. These restrictions and fear of government retaliation have deterred civil society groups from raising awareness about the relocation process and the human rights abuses against affected communities.

Through its relocation process, Tanzania has violated numerous rights of Maasai residents and their communities in the NCA and of Msomera residents, as codified in regional and international treaties ratified by Tanzania, including the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). The Maasai and other Indigenous peoples are also protected by the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). International human rights law protects the rights of the Maasai and other rural rights-holders to, among other things, property and land, participation, information, freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, education, and the highest obtainable standard of health.

Maasai communities in the NCA are specifically protected by Tanzanian laws, including the Ngorongoro Conservation Area Ordinance of 1959 and subsequent amendments, the Land Acquisition Act of 1967, the Land Act of 1999, and the Village Land Act of 1999, that recognize their legal status within the NCA, rights to customary land, consultation, and compensation.

The government of Tanzania should immediately halt the relocations of residents from the NCA. The authorities should meaningfully consult all affected communities in the NCA and seek the free, prior and informed consent of affected Indigenous communities. They should also meaningfully consult affected residents in Msomera. Those who consent to be relocated should receive adequate compensation based on their informed consent.

The government should reinstate funding and other resources for social services that have been decreased or transferred out of the NCA in violation of the rights of affected communities, including for education and health care. It should also create an independent alternative grievance and redress mechanism that can process complaints of and provide remedies for human rights violations related to these relocations.

Glossary

Game-Controlled Area (GCA): Locations designated under Tanzanian law that the president may set aside for biodiversity conservation, to preserve wildlife populations, promote tourism, and generate revenue through controlled hunting activities. Unlike game reserves, on GCAs, people can live, cultivate, and keep livestock unrestricted.

Indigenous peoples: The rights of Indigenous peoples are addressed in United Nations and African standards. Under international law, Indigenous peoples are ethnic and cultural groups with deep connections to their traditional lands and resources. They have distinct rights outlined in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, including the right to self-determination, control over their lands and resources, and protection of their cultures and languages, and governments are obliged to ensure their free, prior and informed consent in decisions affecting them.

Multiple Land Use Area: In the context of conservation in Tanzania, a “multiple land use area” is a region where conservation efforts should be balanced with sustainable human activities. They aim to protect biodiversity, natural habitats, and wildlife while allowing for responsible resource use and human settlement.

Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA): The NCA, conterminous with Ngorongoro division, is a protected area and a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Tanzania’s northern Ngorongoro district.

Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority (NCAA): The NCAA is a parastatal body under Tanzania’s Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism set up to manage the NCA.

Ngorongoro Pastoral Council (Pastoral Council): The Pastoral Council, which was legally recognized in 2000, functions as an intermediary body connecting the local NCA community with the NCAA. It comprises representatives from the NCA Wards and Villages, offers advice to the NCAA Board of Directors, and possesses the authority to devise and propose projects for approval by the NCAA such as scholarships for students, construction of school buildings, and creating dams and boreholes.

Key Recommendations

To the Government of Tanzania

On Protection of Land Tenure

Respect the human rights, including land and tenure rights, including traditionally-owned and communal land, of Indigenous people and other rights holders in developing and implementing all conservation measures. Legally recognize the lands and resources that pastoralist communities in Ngorongoro district have used and managed for generations, with due respect for their legal systems, traditions, and practices, including traditional grazing methods and rituals.



On Free, Prior and Informed Consent and Participation

Adequately consult and seek the free, prior, and informed consent of affected Indigenous communities in the NCA and meaningfully consult existing Msomera residents affected by the resettlement in line with national and international obligations. Provide all affected communities access to all relevant information on proposed conservation strategies and developments that would impact their lives as individuals and as a community. Guarantee the participation of all members of affected communities in decision-making related to land and natural resources, including through inclusive gender- and youth-responsive processes in deciding conservation strategies that respect and protect their rights.



On Education and Health

Uphold the rights of Massai to education, the highest attainable standard of health, to water and sanitation, to adequate housing, food and to take part in cultural life in the NCA.

Restore job openings for government-paid medical staff at medical facilities, including Endulen Hospital and other dispensaries, in the NCA.

On NCAA Rangers

Require and ensure that rangers are appropriately trained in national and international human rights law and standards and subject to effective independent oversight and accountability.

On Monitoring and Grievance Mechanisms

Conduct ongoing monitoring and cease the implementation of conservation strategies that violate rights such as protected areas or conservation-related forced evictions and involuntary displacements.

Set up an independent alternative grievance and redress mechanism that can receive complaints of and provide remedies for human rights violations related to the relocation of residents from the NCA and resettlement in Msomera.

To the Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority

Restore funding for services and upkeep of existing infrastructure in the NCA, including to Endulen Hospital and local schools, re-establish and strengthen the Ngorongoro Pastoralist Council, and ensure there are no hurdles for the Pastoral Council to implement its mandate.

Consult with community representatives, including the Pastoral Council to develop clear guidance around construction authorizations, and permitted construction materials, for example, found locally, sourced sustainably, and are culturally significant to the community.

Design an “open door” system, with the involvement of representatives from NCA communities, that eliminates or minimizes the burden of paying the entry fee on NCA residents who do not have their identification documents to enter at the gates and provides ease of access to these Indigenous community members.

Develop a rights-respecting conservation strategy with standard, transparent operating procedures on inclusive consultative processes with NCA communities. Engage with communities in the NCA to build a plan for sustainable food and water sources that is culturally appropriate, supports their livelihoods, and ensures they are food secure.

Implement long-term community-led monitoring and evaluation, recognizing that planned relocations require long-term support and oversight.

Extend timelines for support to families that have been relocated from the NCA and provide compensation based on their informed consent.

Allow relocated residents to return to the NCA, should they wish to do so, and facilitate their return, including through financial assistance to rebuild houses and buy cattle.

Investigate abuses by NCAA rangers in the NCA, including restrictions on movement, and hold them accountable through appropriate disciplinary and judicial avenues.





Methodology

This report is based on research that Human Rights Watch conducted in Tanzania in Dar Es Salaam; Arusha, Endulen village in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA), Mto Wa Mbu, and Karatu villages in Arusha region; and Msomera village and Handeni town, in Handeni district, Tanga region between August 2022 and December 2023.

Human Rights Watch interviewed nearly 100 people, including 37 women and 57 men, for this report. Interviewees consisted of community members of the NCA who are facing relocation and those who have been relocated to Msomera village, existing residents of Msomera village, a government administrator, representatives of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and local activists.

Human Rights Watch conducted interviews in-person and by telephone. In-person interviews consisted of individual interviews and group interviews of between two and four people, except in one meeting with 10 people. The 10-person group interview in Endulen, NCA, was a result of restrictions on movement within the NCA, surveillance by NCAA rangers, fear of discovery, and to minimize exposure of residents and possible government reprisal against local community members who spoke with Human Rights Watch. Human Rights Watch conducted the interviews in English, Kiswahili, and Maa, with the aid of interpreters as needed.

Interviews took place in confidential settings or remotely through secure means of communication. Human Rights Watch informed all participants of the purpose of the interview, its voluntary nature, how the information would be used, and that they could refuse to participate or end the interview at any time. Each participant orally consented. Human Rights Watch did not compensate interviewees or offer other incentives for participating.

The report uses pseudonyms and withholds identifying details to protect interviewees from possible reprisals from government authorities.

In addition to interviews, Human Rights Watch reviewed legal documents, including laws, ministerial regulations, court decisions, and other material related to the NCA and land rights in Tanzania. Human Rights Watch also reviewed other secondary sources including NGO reports, research institutes, and media articles.

On May 10, 2024, Human Rights Watch wrote to the Ministries of Natural Resources and Tourism, Health, Education, and Community Development, Gender and Children; Offices of the President – Palace (Special Work), and Regional Administration and Local Government; Arusha Regional Office, Ngorongoro District Commissioner, Tanga Regional Office, and Handeni District Commissioner; Tanzania Police Force; and the Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority (NCAA), to share its research findings and request information but did not receive a response.





Background

Tanzania’s Efforts to Improve its Image

Samia Suluhu Hassan became Tanzania’s first female president on March 19, 2021, succeeding President John Magufuli, who died on March 17, 2021. A marked deterioration in respect for human rights, including government clampdowns on the media, NGOs, political opposition, and other critics of the government had characterized Magufuli’s presidency. Shortly after Suluhu Hassan took office, she promised to address human rights concerns and took steps to remove some restrictions on freedoms of expression and assembly, such as lifting a six-year ban on political rallies by opposition parties, and a ban on four media outlets. However, restrictions on the media and civic spaces, and arbitrary arrests of journalists and government critics, continued.

President Suluhu Hassan has spearheaded a campaign to boost tourism in Tanzania after it stagnated during Magufuli’s presidency and the Covid-19 pandemic. The campaign sought to attract international tourists to Tanzania by promoting its beaches, wildlife, mountains, and cultural heritage. In an installment of the long-running show “The Royal Tour,” which was shown on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in the United States in April 2022, President Suluhu Hassan took filmmakers on tours through Kilimanjaro National Park, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA), the Serengeti National Park, and Mkomazi nature reserves, among others.

Maasai’s Indigenous Practices and Conservation

The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights has set out four key criteria for identifying Indigenous peoples: “the occupation and use of a specific territory; the voluntary perpetuation of cultural distinctiveness; self-identification as a distinct collectivity, as well as recognition by other groups; an experience of subjugation, marginalisation, dispossession, exclusion or discrimination.” The commission stated that “a common thread that runs through all the various criteria that attempts to describe indigenous peoples – that indigenous peoples have an unambiguous relationship to a distinct territory and that all attempts to define the concept recognise the linkages between people, their land, and culture.”

The Maasai are an Indigenous people who, alongside other ethnic groups, have occupied the lands of Ngorongoro in northern Tanzania for generations. They grow maize, beans, pumpkins, and sweet potatoes, and they graze cattle, sheep, and goats, which require large areas of pastureland. Because the Maasai strive to live harmoniously with wildlife, their customs promote conservation of natural resources. Such customs prohibit the consumption of bushmeat – meat from wildlife – instead of beef from their cattle; and that tree branches, not a whole live tree, should be cut for use. Further, the Maasai’s traditional rules on managing pasture areas include fallow periods, grazing timed to season, and wildlife migration patterns.

Over centuries, the Maasai have contributed to the creation of an environment that promotes healthy interactions and mutual adaptation between pastoralists, livestock, and wild animals. Their cultural and spiritual practices, including rituals on adulthood, are interwoven with the land, with sacred areas for assemblies to teach young Maasai about their culture and how they live with the surrounding ecosystem.

Ngorongoro Conservation Area Multiple Land Use Plan

When British colonial authorities declared the Serengeti area a national park in 1951, communities within its borders were relocated to Ngorongoro for permanent settlement. Based on negotiated agreements between the Maasai who previously lived and used the Serengeti, and the colonial government, the government established the Ngorongoro Conservation Area in 1959 to create a permanent homeland for the people who lived in and around the Ngorongoro Crater, the vast majority of whom are Maasai herders. The NCA was created as a multiple land use area, with Maasai traditional pastoralists coexisting with the wildlife.

A United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Site since 1979, the NCA spans about 809,440 hectares that include vast areas of highland plains, savanna, savanna woodlands, forests, and the Ngorongoro Crater. It adjoins the Serengeti National Park and is part of the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem in functioning as wildlife corridors essential to protecting the integrity of animal migrations.

Ngorongoro Conservation Area Governance Structure The Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority (NCAA) is under the authority of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism. A Conservator or Conservation Commissioner and Board of Directors are charged with managing the NCAA. The president of Tanzania appoints a Conservation Commissioner, while the minister of natural resources and tourism appoints the Board of Directors. Although the Ngorongoro Conservation Area is in Ngorongoro district, according to the Ngorongoro Conservation Area Act, the NCAA’s conservation commissioner, under the minister of natural resources and tourism, has primary authority and responsibility over the Ngorongoro Conservation Area

The NCA Authority is a parastatal supervised by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism that manages the NCA. There are 11 wards in the NCA, sub-divided into 25 villages, with 16 having official registration numbers. The villages have been surveyed, boundaries delimited and registered, per the 1982 Local Government (District Authorities) Act, through the Ngorongoro District Council. The commissioner of lands, ministry of lands, housing, and human settlements development, has earmarked 18 villages to survey, map and legalize as village land, per the 1999 Village Land Act. The population of the NCA is estimated at 100,793, according to Tanzania’s 2022 census.

Since it was created, the NCA has integrated conservation with human development. The NCAA’s General Management Plan, created in 1996, has primary objectives to conserve the natural resources of the NCA, protect the interests of Maasai pastoralists, and promote tourism.

Over time, the Tanzanian government, the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, which provides authoritative interpretation of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, and its advisory bodies, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), and the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM), three international organizations named in the Convention, have flagged human and livestock population growth within the NCA as a cause for concern. These institutions have pointed out that there would be an increased need for land and resources, which would exert heightened pressures on and possibly disrupt the ecosystem. These concerns eventually led to a call by the UNESCO World Heritage Center and its advisory bodies for the government to review the General Management Plan, and a recommendation to “promote and encourage voluntary resettlement of communities, consistent with the policies of the Convention and relevant international norms, from within the property to outside by 2028.”

Human Rights Watch has not made a determination on the validity of the concerns regarding human and livestock increase in the NCA. However, even if these concerns are valid, addressing them cannot be used as a justification for human rights abuses, and that the government should engage with communities in the NCA to devise rights respecting solutions for the preservation of their traditional livelihoods and the NCA.

The government established the Pastoral Council of Ngorongoro Pastoralists (Ngorongoro Pastoral Council) in 1994, and it took effect in 2000. The Pastoral Council, consists of representatives of Village Councils and Ward Development Committees, including ward councilors, village chairpersons, women, young people, and traditional leaders. The Pastoral Council develops and plans for the implementation of projects for the purpose of development of pastoralists within the NCA. It submits proposed projects to the NCAA, and the NCAA transfers the funds budgeted for development projects in any given financial year to the Pastoral Council to fulfill its function. The Pastoral Council also advises the NCAA Board of Directors regarding development projects in the NCA, such as during the planning and construction of new hotels, and campsites.

According to an April 2022 government communication to the UN Special Procedures Branch of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR):

The NPC has the following functions: (i) To oversee the actual needs of the pastoral communities living in NCA. (ii) It is an advisory body to the NCAA's board of Directors on resident development and conservation matter of NCA. (iii) To ensure that other organs such as village governments and ward development committee are given opportunities to participate fully in providing their ideas on how to combat challenges facing the communities in NCA. (iv) To cooperate with other stakeholders mainly NCAA, donors, governmental and non-governmental organisations, the Ngorongoro District Council and other district authorities (neighbor district) in fulfilling its core activities. (v) To implement NPC activities and policies as approved by NCAA board of directors. (vi) To identify obstacles of resident's development and provide strategies for solving such problems by cooperating with other stakeholders.

The Pastoral Council provided scholarships for schoolchildren and university students, and it constructed primary schools, dams, and boreholes, until the NCAA took steps to defund it starting in 2019.

The Tanzanian government and the NCAA have, since at least 1975, cited concerns over increased human and livestock population within the NCA to justify restricting the access of community members and their cattle to certain areas that the NCAA considers as high priority areas, including the Ngorongoro crater floor, crater rim, and the northern highland forest reserve. They also prohibited farming—phased out over a period of time, and set up separate zones for human settlement and wildlife. Around 2021, the government devised a plan to relocate about 82,000 residents out of the NCA by 2027.

Previous Involuntary Relocation and Evictions of Maasai

Since 2022, the government has implemented plans to resettle Maasai families that live in the NCA to Msomera village, Handeni district, Tanga region, which is about 600 kilometers east of Ngorongoro. Msomera was selected, according to Albert Msendo, Handeni district commissioner, because the area is a “remote wilderness with many areas that had not been interfered with by farming activities, making it easy to plan for pastoralist activities,” adding that other pastoralist Maasai communities had already occupied Msomera.

This is not the first time the government has relocated people from the NCA. Between 2007 and 2010, the NCAA relocated 159 families from the NCA to Jema Village, Sale division, Ngorongoro district. Though the government had established infrastructure for social services including a primary school, a medical dispensary, police post and piped water, the government asserted that the resettlements were not completely successful. More than 50 percent of the resettled residents have since moved back to the NCA or other parts of the country. In 2009, the 50 to 70 families that had remained at the resettlement site had faced resistance from the host communities and had been planning to leave the area as well.



Forced Eviction of Maasai from Other Parts of Ngorongoro District North of the NCA in Loliondo division, Ngorongoro district, the government has embarked on several operations to forcibly evict Maasai communities from several villages bordering the Serengeti National Park despite protests by the community, widespread international criticism, and a 2018 court injunction against evictions.[48] On June 6, 2022, the government announced it would convert 1,500 square kilometers of village land in a designated game-controlled area[49] into a game reserve, prohibiting the primarily pastoralist Maasai residents from living on and using the land as they had previously done. Two days later, dozens of police, military personnel, and game rangers arrived in Loliondo to demarcate the proposed game reserve. Human Rights Watch found that over several days, security forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters and bystanders, injuring at least 30, including women, children, and older people, and that forces arbitrarily arrested and detained 10 community leaders. After June 2022, the authorities engaged in abusive and unlawful practices, including burning houses within the demarcated area, beatings, shootings, sexual violence, and arbitrary arrests to forcibly evict residents from their land.[50]





Forced Relocation of Maasai from the Ngorongoro Conservation Area

The government brought us here, and I came because of the inconvenience and harassment I was experiencing there in Ngorongoro. You cannot build, farm, or ride a motorcycle, so we decided to move.

–Mary I., Msomera, April 11, 2023

According to the 2019 Multiple Land Use Model (MLUM Plan) of Ngorongoro Conservation Area report, previous relocations from the NCA were not successful, but the authorities have pressed on with new planned relocations.

On June 16, 2022, the government began relocating the Maasai from the NCA to Msomera village, Tanga region. Government estimates indicate that about 551 households, comprising 3,010 people, and 15,321 livestock, have been relocated as of January 2023. Msendo told Human Rights Watch that contrary to what happened with the relocation to Sale division between 2007 and 2010, the government has made efforts to coordinate with the local authorities from both regions, including the NCAA, Ngorongoro District Council, and Handeni District Council.

However, the government’s planning and implementation process have failed to ensure that the authorities sought free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) from community members. The government plans to relocate thousands of Indigenous Maasai herders from land they have used and occupied for generations should have triggered an FPIC process for the government to seek the affected Indigenous peoples’ free and informed consent before the relocation plan was adopted and prior to its implementation. The affected Maasai communities were not involved in designing and during the adoption of the plan. Further, the government has not adequately informed and consulted the communities regarding their relocation from the NCA and resettlement in Msomera.

Authorities are also driving Maasai families in the NCA to leave against their will by violating their human rights. They have reduced the availability and accessibility of goods and services essential to residents' human rights by defunding education and healthcare facilities. They have restricted residents' freedom of movement and access to ancestral lands that contain cultural sites and pasture vital for livelihoods. NCAA rangers have assaulted and harassed NCA residents if they do not comply with the government’s rules, as documented below. As a result, some residents said they had no choice but to leave the NCA. These actions used by authorities to force residents out of the NCA violate a range of NCA residents’ rights, and together amount to forced evictions in violation of Tanzania's treaty obligations under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.

Inadequate Free, Prior, and Informed Consent Process

Free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) is both a component of the universal right to self-determination and a distinct right of Indigenous peoples consistent with international law and standards. FPIC ensures Indigenous peoples can freely determine their political status, and pursue their economic, social, and cultural development. It allows Indigenous peoples to give or withhold consent to a project that may affect them or their territories. Once they have given their consent, they can withdraw it at any stage. Furthermore, FPIC enables Indigenous peoples to negotiate the conditions under which a development that affects the lands, territories, and resources that they customarily own, occupy or otherwise use will be designed, implemented, monitored, and evaluated. FPIC centers on meaningful consultation through Indigenous peoples’ own representative institutions or structures (without coercion, intimidation, or manipulation); far enough in advance of any authorization or commencement of activities; and access to all information regarding the activity, policy or project that would impact Indigenous peoples and their lands. No relocation of Indigenous peoples from their land or territories should take place without their free, prior and informed consent and only after agreement on just and fair compensation and, where possible, the option of return.

Human Rights Watch’s research and analysis found that the Tanzanian government has not engaged in any of these processes to ensure the free, prior and informed consent of the Maasai in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area.

Inadequate Consultation

Building on elements of FPIC: the consultation process, timeline, and decision-making structure should be self-directed by the affected community. That means, meetings and decisions take place at locations and times and in languages and formats determined by the affected community; all community members are free to participate regardless of gender, age or standing; and the affected community must be able to participate through their own freely chosen representatives, while ensuring the participation of youth, women, the elderly and persons with disabilities as much as possible.

A traditional leader explained what he sees as consultation that is meaningful:

Consultation is not only just being notified. It is something that needs all of us to sit down and make an analysis of all of the issues: pastoralism, development, tourism… things that touch all people. It is not enough for just us leaders to meet: we need to meet with the community. The government will say what it needs, we say what we need, and we discuss all of those.

The government did not consult affected communities prior to designing the relocation plan, which is counter to an FPIC process. In 2018, the government reviewed the NCA’s Multiple Land Use Plan and recommended zoning, dividing area based on allowable activities, such as residential, pasture and others, with an option for relocation. NCA residents, including community leaders, told Human Rights Watch that the government did not properly consult the affected communities during and after the review. After the government published its review in a 2019 report, residents and NGOs working with the communities within the NCA issued a community report in May 2022 countering some of the main findings of the government’s report and submitted it to the government. However, community leaders and residents said the government has refused to engage on their report and its recommendations proposing alternatives to relocation.

Residents said that the government decided about the “voluntary relocation,” where people would be relocated, and built houses without any input from affected communities or their leaders. A village councilor from Ngorongoro district raised concerns about the lack of transparency: “the government went in secret and identified Msomera and built more than 100 houses in secret.”

Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa met with community leaders, including village councilors, on February 17, 2022, seemingly to socialize the plan to relocate residents from the NCA. A village councilor who attended the meeting said attendees thought the meeting was meant to hear their views and they presented several alternate options to relocation, but that the prime minister only came to give instructions on how to register for relocation.

A traditional leader in the NCA described the meeting:

That was not a consultation because he just spoke and went. There was nothing like taking people’s views and concerns. … The prime minister visited the area; many people went, but they were refused to enter. He just selected a few people—ward and village officers—and he just said what he thought and went away.

Another community leader, a member of the Pastoral Council, said that any supposed consultation by the government with the community, including the meeting with the prime minister, lacked sufficient engagement of leaders and the communities as a whole.[69]

District Level Governance: Ngorongoro district is made up of Ngorongoro, Loliondo, and Sale divisions. Each division is further divided into wards. The Ngorongoro district commissioner, head of the district council, is the highest authority at the district level and reports to the Arusha regional commissioner. The Ngorongoro district council administers the district with representatives from the divisions (division secretaries) and ward councils (ward secretaries). Village Level Governance: Each village has an assembly led by an elected village council. Elected village level leaders include village chairpersons of the village council, and sub-village chairpersons. Traditional governance structures and authorities, such as the laigwanak, anointed traditional leaders who settle disputes and offer wisdom within the community, exist outside of the government village administrative structure. The law requires that in Tanzania’s mainland, women must constitute one-third of the members of each district council[70] and one-fourth of the members of each township authority[71] and village council.[72] In Tanzania Zanzibar, the municipal, town, and district councils consist of members appointed by the minister responsible for local government, of which 40 percent must be women.[73]

Inadequate Access to Information

Regarding the nature of the consultative process and in order for conditions of FPIC to be met, authorities need to ensure the affected community members have adequate access to information. This should mean that the affected community should be provided, on an ongoing basis, information that is accessible (including delivered in a local language, in places they can easily access, and in a culturally appropriate format), clear, consistent, accurate, objective, complete, and transparent. Tanzanian authorities, however, provided far too little information on certain aspects of the relocation process, including compensation, and what conditions to expect in Msomera. Residents said there are no opportunities to get answers to questions they have, related to the relocation process.

Several residents said that the only information they received from the government was from the prime minister during the February 17, 2022, meeting on registering for relocation. The prime minister said that interested individuals should register their names at the offices of the regional and district commissioners and the Ngorongoro Conservation Commissioner.

The chairperson of a village council – the administrative body responsible for governing villages – in the NCA, said:

[We] have been holding meetings to complain about the government or political party, but there have been no answers since March [2022]. We haven’t seen any leader from the district or national level coming to these Ngorongoro areas to talk to the citizens and answer their questions since the unrest [in neighboring Loliondo in June 2022]. From the district to national level, no leader has come to listen to the citizens of the Ngorongoro area and know what their problems are. We’ve been shouting and it’s like the leaders have isolated us. People are losing hope, and they feel like keeping quiet is the only option.

Some residents recounted information they widely believed to be rumors about resettled residents receiving cash compensation of 10 million shillings (US$3,970). Human Rights Watch found that authorities have not released information on compensation, including amounts or how compensation is calculated or negotiated. “The entire process is not open and transparent,” a village council chairperson said. “The government says they are giving money, but no one knows what the government will give them until they have moved. There’s no chance for negotiation.”

Several community leaders said they did not know which villagers registered for relocation until the day they were transported out of the NCA. As such, their community leaders cannot provide them any support during the relocation process.

A councilor said there is lack of information regarding the relocation process: “The government has never taken any leaders or representatives to Msomera. The government does not want us to know. If someone registers to move, they stop talking to leaders.”

Given the communities’ inadequate access to information, the opaque relocation process, and no clear pathway for addressing grievances, residents said they have limited avenues to engage with the government to ensure it protects their rights, including whether they choose to relocate or remain.

A youth leader said:

We do not know anything about Msomera. What we have heard is that people have lost their livestock. How do we make sure the government guarantees that in two to five years if resettled residents lose all their livestock, they will get it replaced, receive compensation, or support? How can the community make sure the government provides these assurances if we have no information?

Human Rights Watch’s documentation of inadequate consultation and inadequate access to information would also appear to amount to forced evictions as outlined by the UN Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (CESCR) and guidelines from the UN special rapporteur on adequate housing.

Funding Cuts to Social Services in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area

All the more than 70 NCA residents who spoke to Human Rights Watch said they did not want to relocate. They said that since 2019, after the publication of the government’s report, the government began to systematically downsize essential social services for NCA residents and defunded the Ngorongoro Pastoral Council.[83] Service provision in the NCA was already less available and accessible and of generally poorer quality than in other areas across the country.[84]

Residents alleged that the government cut funding of public services to force them to leave the area. “In Ngorongoro the government gave the name ‘voluntary relocation,’ but there is no voluntary relocation,” one resident said. “The government is using different ways to torture our community.”[85]

The government has reduced the availability, accessibility, and quality of important social services like schools and hospitals in the NCA, including through budget cuts and other limitations on necessary resources such as trained personnel. These practices have undermined realization of NCA residents' rights, including to education and health care, and have made their continued access to their ancestral lands far more difficult. Maasai families have been left with no better option than to register for relocation from the NCA to Msomera.

Their registration is not effective consent, as consent in FPIC refers to the collective decision made by the affected Indigenous peoples and reached through their customary decision-making processes. Consent should be sought and granted or withheld to the affected Indigenous peoples’ unique formal or informal representative decision-making structures.

Defunding the Ngorongoro Pastoral Council

Some of the residents who were or are still members of the Pastoral Council said that until 2019 the council identified community needs, including education, health, water, and food; developed and presented projects to meet these needs to the NCAA board for approval and disbursement of funds; and carried them out. Before the 2019/2020 fiscal year, which started on July 1, 2019, the annual budget of the Pastoral Council was about three billion shillings (US$1,150,000) for development projects and the NCAA student scholarship program. All of the Pastoral Council’s budget was from allocations from the NCAA.

Residents said that in 2019, the NCAA raised allegations of mismanagement of funds by the Pastoral Council with the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau, a quasi-judicial body that investigates and prosecutes corruption offenses in mainland Tanzania. According to a Pastoral Council member, these allegations were never proven, but the bureau made a recommendation to the then-vice president and now current president, for the NCAA to allocate future funds to the Department of Community Development under the Ngorongoro District Council rather than to the Pastoral Council for project implementation.

Pastoral Council members said that the government did not de-register the council but eliminated its yearly budget allocations, effectively ensuring that the Council no longer had the ability to implement programs and make independent decisions. One member described the effect of the government’s decision on the council:

Now, the Pastoral Council has no autonomy, it sits at the request of the NCAA. The NCAA calls the meetings and proposes the budget. [The Pastoral Council’s] mandate has shrunk. Taking away resources ensures that the Pastoral Council is weak, especially since it has found it impossible to fundraise on its own given that it is considered a government establishment.

Since 2020, the Pastoral Council has not received any money from the NCAA or the Department of Community Development – including money for renovations, construction of school facilities, and other community projects within the NCA – which has adversely impacted the maintenance of school facilities, including construction of latrines, repair of classrooms, and provision of additional desks and beds for the students. Pastoral Council members also said subsequent NCAA funding allocations since then, especially disbursement for health centers and schools, were reduced.

Impact on Access to Education

The actions taken by government authorities to intentionally downscale and undermine school conditions in the NCA affected hundreds of children’s access and enjoyment of the right to education.

Limited Disbursement of Scholarships

The Pastoral Council’s defunding, according to interviewees, has led to delays in the disbursement of funds to university students, creating cost barriers that reduce access to higher education. From 2020, the NCAA has shifted the responsibility of sponsoring students on scholarship from the Pastoral Council to the Ngorongoro district office. These scholarships are for university students from the NCA, financed by the NCAA through the Student Scholarship Program.

University students who benefit from school-related support or sponsorship said that in the past, the Pastoral Council had usually promptly disbursed their funds. However, university students said they now experience long wait times and serious challenges before receiving the funds. “Sometimes the money comes from the district council after a long time, and usually after a lot of struggles,” one student said. “Plus, it’s not enough.”

An NCA resident said that university students have not only received less sponsorship support, the district council delays scholarship payments, and in some cases the university does not recognize them as scholarship beneficiaries as they no longer receive introductory letters from the NPC.

Impact on the Availability of Adequate School Facilities

Community leaders and school administrators are required to apply for funding and authorization from the NCAA to construct or renovate school facilities within the NCA. However, since 2021, the NCAA has refused all requests for construction permits without providing any explanation. Community leaders said if they attempt to use their own resources without NCAA permits, they face harassment and even arrest.

Human Rights Watch learned of several schools in the NCA in poor conditions as a result of the NCAA’s refusal to release funds or issue permits for improvements to primary and secondary schools. Residents highlighted instances when this happened. Esere Primary School in Esere has many old and dilapidated buildings, overflowing latrines, and inadequate number of classroom desks, but community members said the NCAA has rejected their requests for funding and permission to renovate. Olbalbal Primary School in Olbalbal needs a latrine, but the NCAA rejected a proposal to construct one. The Ngorongoro Girls Secondary School, which has about 500 students, has inadequate number of desks, so children sit on the floor during classes, and there are only seven latrines in one building for all the girls. The NCAA appears to have been stalling to authorize the construction of another building for latrines. And when the roof of a building in Misigiyo Primary School was destroyed during the rainy season in 2021, the NCAA transferred 2,780,000 shillings ($1,065) to the school account to rebuild when the incident happened in 2021. However, since then, the NCAA has refused to issue a permit to carry out the renovations and refused to allow community residents to bring new iron sheets into the NCA to repair it. Community members said that when they attempted to reuse parts that came off the roof when it was damaged, the NCAA refused to issue a construction permit.

Permits are key, without which residents cannot enter the NCA gates with the necessary construction materials for school facilities, such as metal sheets for roofing, or make improvements themselves without a permit. When the community have raised funds to renovate and construct school buildings in the NCA, the NCAA denied residents the required permits, as well as authorization to transport construction materials into the area. It does not provide explanations for its rejections. For example, Ngorongoro Girls School has 300 million shillings ($115,000), which was raised over several years by the community, to renovate the school, but the NCAA has not issued the required permits.

In 2022, one resident used her own resources to build two classrooms for a pre-school, but the NCAA did not allow her to bring roofing materials into the NCA. Consequently, the students lack coverage from the rains during the rainy season.

Residents have attempted to use traditional materials to construct, but that presents its own challenge, due to restrictions on cutting trees and branches.

In 2022, the government redirected educational funding from the NCA to Tanga region for new schools in Msomera, which is where NCA residents are being relocated. According to media reports, the Ngorongoro district council issued two directives to six public schools in the NCA in March 2022, instructing them to redirect approximately 200 million shillings ($76,500) in Covid relief funds to the Msomera resettlement site.

Defunding and Downgrading Health Facilities

Residents whom Human Rights Watch interviewed said the government has directly and indirectly caused a reduction of available health services and reduced the quality of health services in the NCA.

A councilor in Esere village provided examples of how the government has ceased supporting health care in the NCA:

I can’t compare Endulen [Hospital] now to before. Before, the government provided support plus hospital staff they paid. Before, Endulen had the mother and childcare services with enough medicines. Now, the government has cut off all support; they have taken the doctors they brought [to Endulen Hospital] back into government hospitals.

In October 2022, the government announced that it would downgrade Endulen Hospital, a 110-bed hospital managed by the Catholic Church since 1965 and the only hospital providing comprehensive medical services to Maasai living in the NCA, to a dispensary due to staffing limitations. A medical worker described how the government arrived at this decision: “In 2018 the NCAA cut off funds to Endulen Hospital. It usually allotted about 30 million shillings ($11,900) annually. But Endulen Hospital had project funds from other donors until 2022.” The medical worker said the hospital’s other donors have since suspended funding because they are worried about its sustainability due to uncertainty related to the relocation process and the possibility of the hospital being forced to shut down.

By 2022, the number of hospital staff had reduced from approximately 60 to 17 people as government-paid staff left to take up government jobs advertised in other locations, and no new openings were advertised at Endulen Hospital to replace the staff that left. In the past, vacancies announcements at Endulen Hospital were advertised for government staff. In December 2022, the government established a committee led by the regional medical officer and the district medical officer to investigate the services at the hospital and found that it has a limited staff. The body thereafter recommended that the hospital discontinue some of the services including ambulance and emergency services, as a result of inadequate staffing, a downgrade from a hospital to a clinic, and permitting provision of basic primary care and pharmacy services only.

Residents and two medical staff said that Endulen Hospital has experienced a serious shortage of medicines, claiming that as a result of such shortage, pain relieving and fever reducing tablets were being doled out for every ailment.

Residents told Human Rights Watch that as a result of lack of some previously available medical services, they had to seek treatment at less-equipped dispensaries. A medical worker at a dispensary in the NCA, explained that their four-room dispensary witnessed an increase in the number of patients over the last year: “When patients see that many services are available here, they talk to each other, so many more come to us.” He pointed out that this dispensary is too small to treat all the patients who formerly accessed health care at Endulen Hospital, and that it cannot expand because the NCAA has denied its request for a construction permit. He added that the staff also feared the government will shut down the dispensary due to the relocation.

Furthermore, some of the other options for medical services in the area have been interrupted. In February 2022, the government grounded the Flying Medical Services, a medical outreach service provided by the Arusha Catholic archdiocese, that provided clinics across Ngorongoro district, which particularly benefitted pregnant women, especially those experiencing difficult childbirth because it could quickly evacuate patients to other hospitals outside the NCA.

To access important services, residents have been forced to travel far distances outside the NCA. An activist recounted the distances people needed to travel to get certain medicines:

The government used to supply medicine for HIV treatment, but they’re no longer doing that. If you want to get the medicine for that you have to go [60 kilometers] to Karatu [in neighboring Karatu district]. And for TB treatment, they stopped doing that as well. You have to go [200 kilometers] to Arusha [the regional headquarters] to get that.

Increased distance to primary healthcare facilities poses serious challenges in situations where transportation choices are limited and reliance on non-motorized modes of transportation, including walking, is predominant. A community worker said that a pregnant and anemic woman could not get a blood transfusion at Endulen Hospital due to the reduction in staff and services, and as a result was referred to a hospital in Karatu, about 60 kilometers away. Another pregnant woman from Esere, who was hit by a safari vehicle had to be rushed to Karatu for medical treatment; on her way back into the NCA, she went into labor and gave birth in the car. Given the poor quality of health care in the NCA, medical workers advise pregnant women to go to Karatu for pregnancy and prenatal care; some with difficult pregnancies have had to stay in Karatu, away from their families, for weeks, while waiting for labor to start.

In some crisis and emergency situations, the outcomes have been dire. One woman said that between April and May 2023, three women died as a result of pregnancy-related complications for which they could not get the necessary, life-saving health services at Endulen Hospital. Another woman shared a health-related difficulty within her family: “My uncle’s daughter gave birth to twins. The babies were born on the way to Karatu hospital. They were early at seven months. Both babies died because we could not get them the right services as soon as possible.” Human Rights Watch did not conduct an analysis of pre- and post-2022 maternal and infant mortality rates in the NCA.

Residents said that in the past, the government and NGOs had carried out campaigns to raise awareness of pregnant women’s and newborn’s health and encouraged women to go to the hospital during pregnancy and for ante- and postnatal care. Given the current situation, residents expressed their concerns that the government is reversing its own policies by reducing access to health care in the NCA. “We have been educated that we should go to the hospital when pregnant,” one woman said. “But now we don’t have those services anymore.”

World Health Organization data analyzed by Human Rights Watch revealed that the government of Tanzania spent the equivalent of only about 0.91 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) or 5.14 percent of its national budget on health care in 2021, the most recent year for which data is available. This falls far short of two key international benchmarks associated with reducing inequalities of healthcare access and outcomes: spending 5 percent of GDP or 15 percent of national expenditures on health care through public means. This level of public investment also fails to meet Tanzania's explicit commitment in the African Union’s 2001 Abuja Declaration to spent at least 15 percent of its national budget on health care. While Tanzania has also faced significant public debt issues, paying roughly four-times as much on a per person basis to service its external public debts in 2021 than it paid on health care, the government needs to take efforts to ensure that socially and economically marginalized groups, including Indigenous communities, do not bear the brunt of any funding reductions.

Restrictions on movement in and out of Ngorongoro Conservation Area

Some residents told Human Rights Watch that the NCAA had restricted entry into the NCA since February 2022, limiting the movement of residents, including those who need to access services outside the area.

NCAA rangers require residents to show identification (ID) as proof of residence within the NCA before allowing them passage through the gates to their villages. Residents who do not have ID or voter registration cards or forgot them at home are denied entry when returning home and must pay 11,800 shillings ($5), the fee for entry as a Tanzanian tourist. “The people in NCA come out and go to Karatu to buy grain, to the hospital, or a student going to university,” one resident said. “When they return, the gatekeepers deny them entry, embarrassing them.”[123] A ward councilor said she was refused entry when returning from a councilors’ meeting in Loliondo because she forgot her voter registration card at home. She stayed at the gates until someone came along who could identify her. She said: “If I can face that how are normal people faring?”

One NCA resident said that NCAA rangers would arbitrarily ask for different forms of identification:

If today I am in Arusha and I want to go to Ngorongoro, I must have an ID to enter the place.... Even if they know you’re a resident, you must show that. You can have a national ID, [but] sometimes they want you to show them the electoral card. And sometimes you have the electoral card, and they want you to show them the [national] ID.

The NCAA also charges all vehicles, including local transport vehicles, a permit fee for every entry. The fee differs based on the weight of the vehicle, with a minimum of 23,600 shillings ($9). Drivers pay a per-day fee. Residents say the drivers of vehicles transporting people in or out of the NCA have transferred these extra costs to residents, making transportation far more expensive and “going out difficult.”

A traditional leader explained the repercussions for residents who fall sick and cannot afford the cost of traveling:

Every resident is feeling the pain. If you fall sick you think of the huge cost you will incur to search for health services. The poorer people are much more vulnerable because they don’t have money to travel far, and the local dispensaries do not have medicines. You can sell livestock and access these services. The other option is to use local traditional herbs or pray to god for a miracle.

A resident who has been publicly critical of the government’s relocation of Maasai people from the NCA said authorities had blocked him from returning home because of his activism. He said that a police officer denied them entry at the gate to the NCA when they returned home from a trip in October 2022 saying that their identity document was not registered. The activist believes they were followed by government security officers during their trip and that the officers at the gate had been forewarned about their arrival.

The NCAA requests for differing ID to prove residence and otherwise charging a tourist fee for residents to return home places a huge burden on Indigenous peoples who have historical and current traditional ties to the land and whom the government has enclosed in the NCA. The NCAA needs to design an “open door” system, with the involvement of these communities, that minimizes or eliminates this burden and provides ease of access to Indigenous community members.

Restrictions on access to pasture, water, and cultural sites in Ngorongoro Conservation Area

As a result of government laws and policies, the Maasai communities in the NCA have limited access and use rights over the land they have lived on for generations, and no control over or ability to make decisions on the land, including how revenue from tourism is shared. This includes their access to longstanding pasture, water sources, and cultural sites.

Access to Pasture

NCA residents said that the authorities have restricted their access to important grazing areas, which has been challenging as they depend primarily on animal farming for their livelihood. They said the authorities have blocked them from grazing their animals in different parts of the NCA, including the crater, denying their animals the vital water sources, grass, and nutrient-rich volcanic rocks and soils. In addition, residents said the NCAA stopped providing veterinary services for community members’ livestock around the time the government began relocating people to Msomera.

One village chairperson said:

The government is starting to make us not function at all. They try to weaken us in all means of life. To despair, not to fight, give up and move out. They are trying to make sure that pastoralism comes to an end. We never chase the wild animals to move out. We are very good conservators; we don’t hate the wildlife.

Some residents said that around 2016, government officials informed community members in the NCA, through their leaders, of a decision prohibiting their livestock from accessing the Ngorongoro Crater because of conservation and “ecotourism.” This was disruptive since wildlife and livestock in the NCA rely on geophagy– eating earth, which is done by a wide variety of animals and humans – for nutrient supplementation and to alleviate gastro-intestinal disorders.

The Ngorongoro Crater contains precious perennial water sources, which were invaluable during the dry seasons, and earth licks, which were key for supplementing livestock with nutrients, particularly micronutrients that might be deficient in the grass growing in the area. In turn, these nutrients and availability of water are beneficial for livestock health and boost cow milk production, with important nutritional and financial benefits to the local human population.

Residents had historically grazed their animals in the crater because it contributed to the health and milk production of their cattle, since there are high deposits of sodium and micronutrients, such as selenium, cobalt, manganese, and molybdenum. Three residents of Alaitolei and Nainokanoka wards said that when the NCAA prohibited access to the crater, the authority said they would provide water for human and livestock use to all the villages, and supply supplemental salt to ensure the cattle can get salt at home and not by geophagy in the crater. “The [NCAA] was going to start a ranch at Ngairish sub-village of Kakesio ward,” said one of the residents. “We were going to learn how to grow grass that is good for cows. We will have a good breed for cows, to increase the numbers. We said this is a good plan.”

Residents said that since 2017, when the government began providing supplemental salt to their communities, up to 77,000 cattle had died by December 2021. Community members said they believed that the salt supplied by the government was poisonous and unsafe. Their suspicions were confirmed by a mineral analysis of a salt sample by Tanzania Veterinary Laboratory Agency, a government agency, which concluded that the salt did not comply with the Grazing-Land and Animal Feed Resources (Standard of Animal Feed Resources) Regulations of 2012.

A village council chairperson said the tainted salt affected his community:

We lost all our cattle. In my village, 6,294 cattle died. I lost 120 cattle. [One person] was arrested on June 30, 2022, Simon Saitoti, the ward councilor–because he spoke out about the salt. He was charged with murder [of a policeman in Loliondo]. His cattle all died. He went into prison a rich man and came out a poor man.

In addition to restricting access to the Ngorongoro Crater, NCAA rangers have blocked livestock from accessing water in other areas, including the northern forest, Marshes, Ndutu, and Ormoti and Embakaai craters. Residents alleged that NCAA rangers beat and arrested community members for grazing their animals in areas where the NCAA has prohibited the community from accessing. On June 13, 2022, security forces arrested Paresoi Kiboko after he took his livestock to graze in Ndutu, an area in the NCA that the community had accessed for several years. A lawyer familiar with Kiboko’s case said that rangers beat and detained him and took him to court the next day where he was charged with grazing in a prohibited area and threatening the rangers with a spear. Because Kiboko did not speak English or Swahili and the court did not provide an interpreter, he could not follow the court proceedings in the case against him. Kiboko was imprisoned for nine months before being released in March 2023.

Access to Water Points

The government’s 2016 restrictions on the communities’ access to certain areas within the NCA included places with invaluable water sources for villagers and their cattle.

One community leader told Human Rights Watch:

In my village we used to have a lot of potential places [to access water for our livestock]. There are certain places we would not go to at certain times of the year, say from December to May we wouldn’t go there because of wildebeest [fearing transfer of disease that affects cows]. We would go to the highland and leave the land for the wildebeest. And at certain times of the year there are areas we would only go to during time of drought. But now they’re starting to tell us you cannot go there – places like Ndutu. The NCAA is starting to beat cattle herders.

Residents said the NCAA assured them that their communities would have access to other water sources outside the crater. However, this has not been the case, as our research showed. “The NCAA has not made a permanent place to access water [for livestock],” one woman said. “Last year [2022], during the drought, many of our animals suffered.” Another resident noted that although the British colonial government had dug more than 10 water dams to collect rainwater, only two remained functional.

Since almost all the cattle in the neighboring villages used those two dams, there is a lot of pressure on the two dams. They cannot sufficiently water all the animals because the water in the dams is inadequate, and the pressure from a large number of animals relying on them means the cattle could damage the dams. Several residents said the NCAA had not renovated the eight non-functioning dams or construct new ones. One woman said that although the NCAA has provided pipe-borne water to communities, it is not effective at maintaining or repairing these water points. “When there is a destruction, the NCAA refuses to repair,” she said. “When we got the parts to do the repairs, the NCAA refused [and said] that we shouldn’t repair it and that they have an expert outside the NCA that will repair it.”

The NCAA’s restrictions on key pasture and water points have negatively affected the health of livestock, production of milk, and income from sales of milk and cattle. The NCAA also imposed a complete ban on crop cultivation, which was first introduced in 1975 to support biodiversity conservation. In the past the prime minister has temporarily waived the ban, such as in 1992. Residents acknowledged that the NCAA provides maize at a subsidized price, but that since the confirmation that the death of their cattle was due to the NCAA’s tainted salt, discussed above, residents have lost trust in the NCAA and some have refused to purchase the maize. At the time of our interviews in June 2023, it had been almost two years since some residents stopped buying subsidized maize. The restriction on pasture and water points and the ban on cultivation has led to food insecurity and health implications for the communities within the NCA.

Access to Cultural Sites

In addition to restricting their access to necessary sustenance for their livestock, residents said the authorities have blocked their access to important cultural and traditional sites since around 2016. According to one traditional leader, they are not allowed in ritual sites at the Ngorongoro Crater, the Olmoti Crater, and Mbakai, and Maasai get arrested for going there.

The denial of access to cultural sites, and the prospect of relocation, could result in a disconnect for the Maasai from their culture and way of life—violating their right to culture. This is because their identity and culture are woven with their land. An elder in Endulen who witnessed the 1959 colonial-era relocation of Maasai from the Serengeti recounted the loss of permanent lands:

Serengeti was used for grazing and temporary settlements, and we moved to the highlands [Ngorongoro] during the dry season… where we buried our ancestors. We don’t have anywhere else. Before, our people might have given up Serengeti because we had the highlands, our permanent area. Now, we don’t.

The NCAA’s restrictions have occurred over decades, with promises to provide supplemental grain, access to water points, salt, ranches and veterinary services for livestock to mitigate harm on the affected communities and their livelihood, which it is not currently fulfilling. Under the UNDRIP, consent is not a one-off decision but part of an ongoing FPIC process that is sought, given, and can be withdrawn. Human Rights Watch concluded that the NCAA’s promises of supplemental goods and services have been eroded since the relocation plans were announced, and the restrictions on the communities’ access to pasture, water sources and cultural sites do not meet an FPIC standard.

Abuses by Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority Rangers

The NCAA employs rangers to guard entry points and other areas in the NCA. In the past, rangers were mostly residents of the NCA or Maasai, but residents said that in recent years, community members whom the NCAA employed as rangers who may have been sympathetic to the communities, have been relocated to Msomera. According to one activist:

The people working with the NCAA have their own issues. Because they’re natives [of the NCA], the government is forcing them to relocate. If you don’t want to relocate, they will terminate your employment. My uncle works with the NCAA and they were all pressured. They have to agree with the government.

Some NCA employees who chose not to relocate to Msomera were instead transferred to the Tanzania Wildlife Management Authority and to other protected areas outside of the NCA, including Loliondo Game Controlled Area in Loliondo division.

NCA residents described how the relationship between NCAA rangers and community members has deteriorated dramatically since the government began implementing the relocation program in 2022. They also said that rangers have attacked and beat people living in the area. Human Rights Watch documented at least 13 incidents of alleged beatings by NCAA rangers between September 2022 and July 2023. Residents said these abuses escalated around September 2022.

One NCA resident described how NCAA rangers beat his 35-year-old friend in September 2022 on his way to his uncle’s funeral in Nainokanoka ward:

He was just walking, and they just punished him. They made him kneel – kichura [toad style], and they punished him using a stick. He got injuries on his legs. We don’t have anywhere to report. You go to the same police who have beaten the guy, so you can’t get any aid. There are many cases like this. Rangers are like people who are above the law.

That same month, two rangers severely beat another resident, Letee Ormunderei, at his home in Ngoile ward in the NCA, breaking his legs. An activist said one of the rangers told Ormunderei, “We want you to go to Msomera.” This attack allegedly occurred because Ormunderei owned a motorcycle, which residents of the NCA are prohibited from owning inside the national park.

Human Rights Watch also learned of a ranger attack against a child that has gone unaddressed. On July 13, 2023, an NCAA ranger allegedly beat 15-year-old Joshua Oleparoto, breaking his teeth with the butt of his rifle, as he grazed cattle in the Ormoti area, where residents are prohibited from grazing animals. According to a lawyer familiar with the case, Oleparoto reported and identified the ranger to the police, but at time of writing, the police had not followed up with Oleparoto or charged the ranger with any offense.

Several women said that before the relocation started, women could construct small houses for themselves, especially as additional wives joined their marriage, but now they were not allowed to build such additional homes. One woman said:

If you try to build a small house as a woman, the rangers will take you to the police. The police will order you to pay a fine. The fine is not a fixed amount, it is not uniform, and sometimes they take you to court.

Another woman explained, “In the past, we used to cut trees to build our houses without any problems. But now, if a house collapses and you are seen cutting trees, you are followed until caught and arrested.”

Other residents said NCAA rangers began harassing women and girls for picking up dead tree limbs for firewood. “Women collecting firewood are detained, their machetes are confiscated,” an elder in Endulen said. “Now the rangers are restricting everything, including getting poles to corral our livestock and protect them from wild animals.” During Human Rights Watch’s visit to the NCA in June 2023, girls who were out collecting fallen branches for firewood were cautioned to be careful and watchful, so they are not intercepted by rangers and have their machetes seized.

Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority Rangers A number of laws provide “authorized officers,” including NCAA rangers, with the authority to: 1. Carry and use firearms to carry out their functions and duties, 2. To search and arrest, including without a warrant, 3. To take an individual into custody and convey the detainee “without any undue delay before the nearest magistrate.”





Challenges Around Relocations to Msomera village

Our grandfathers left Serengeti for conservation. Our fathers lived inside the [Ngorongoro] crater and they were removed from there. We are tired of moving. We worry if they move us to Msomera they will even come to move us from there. We want to have a stable life.

– Simon M., Councilor, Mto wa Mbu, June 21, 2023

The Tanzanian government’s resettlement plan consists of relocating Indigenous Maasai people from the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, eastwards about 600 kilometers to Msomera village in Handeni district, Tanga region. The resettlement has been carried out without an FPIC process and there is inadequate consultation and information-sharing with residents of either community. There are 91 villages in Handeni district, of which Msomera is the only one historically occupied by herder communities, including Maasai people. As of 2022 it had a reported population of about 200 households and 7,000 people.

The government estimates that as of January 2023, more than 500 households, including over 3,000 people and 15,300 cattle, had been relocated from the NCA to Msomera village. Human Rights Watch found that their relocation has many implications, including on their ability to maintain close ties with their families and friends who chose to remain.

The government is heavily invested in the relocation and has provided relocated households with a house and land to farm. It provides other benefits as well. A government official and some resettled residents in Msomera who spoke to Human Rights Watch said for each household the government provided resettlement assistance, including transportation, cash of about 10 to 19 million shillings ($3,964 to $7,532), about 200 kilograms of maize, 5 to 7 acres of farm and residential land, and a house in Msomera. However, the resettled residents said the houses were small, culturally inappropriate, and inadequate for large multi-household families. They said that most or all the cattle they brought with them from NCA have died, likely as a result of water scarcity during the dry season, as they have had to water their cattle with salty groundwater.

The earth roads the authorities constructed in the area were being maintained when Human Rights Watch visited Msomera in June 2023. They had also constructed new infrastructure, including a school, dispensary, post office, police post, water supply system, electricity, and cellular network to service the area, while renovating older ones.

Despite these investments, Human Rights Watch found the relocation to have been problematic, including because resettled people were not adequately consulted, and that existing Msomera residents were being forced out of Msomera. Former NCA residents have not received adequate government support to relocate to Msomera as detailed below.

Existing Residents of Msomera

The existing Msomera residents affected by the relocation self-identify as Maasai, pastoralist, and have lived and used the land for decades, but are not Indigenous to the area. At least one resident’s family has government documentation establishing their claim to the land they live on and use. However, the government did not consult existing Msomera residents about its plans to relocate people from the NCA in the area and on land they were living and farming on. Instead, they were discouraged, and even threatened, from asking questions and called “trespassers,” despite their famlies having used the relevant land for decades. Without engaging those already in Msomera, people from the NCA were resettled to the village, resulting in clashes over access to land and resources.

Inadequate Consultation and Threats by the Authorities

Some Msomera residents told Human Rights Watch that until the government started demarcations and constructions in Msomera in February 2022, they were not aware that the area had been identified and designated as a relocation site for people the government was moving out of the NCA. The government did not hold consultative meetings with the communities who would be directly affected by the relocation or to discuss the relocation plans. Instead, the government simply used a mix of contractors and armed personnel to survey, demarcate the land, construct buildings, and relocate new people from the NCA on land previously used by Msomera residents, as discussed below.

Msomera residents said that one day around February 2022 they observed a convoy of about 60 vehicles arrive in their village, including vehicles bearing the regional commissioners for Tanga, Arusha, and Manyara regions. The passengers “came, and looked, and went… and never talked to us,” one resident of Tongoji Ormoti sub-village said.

A few days later, armed military officials and surveyors arrived, built and started living in a camp in the area. Residents said the surveyors began surveying, mapping divisions, and erecting warning signboards in Msomera village. Within days, government contractors began constructing houses in the village. The government officials and contractors did not provide any information or explanation to Msomera residents.

One resident said:

We wondered when we saw the convoy of cars. Then the military went around with guns. I saw people coming, and they even surveyed my house. The military never communicated with us. When surveyors started planting beacons, we confronted them saying, “This is my home! This is my farm! What are you doing?” The surveyors said that they were just civil servants, they have no power to stop, they were sent here, and we should talk to the regional or district commissioner.

Residents said that when they inquired from the regional and district commissioners, they were labelled “trespassers” and “squatters.” The commissioners said the area is a game-controlled area and government property, for the government to use at it pleases.

The same resident said that during the interaction with the then-Handeni district commissioner, the commissioner threatened to arrest them and prohibited them from even asking questions. Another resident who attended the meetings recalled the district and regional commissioners saying, “you are all trespassers and if you continue to ask questions, you will be evicted.”

Many residents said they lost access to the land their families have used for farming and grazing cattle as the land has been divided up, and homes for resettled families, new service buildings, and other infrastructure have been constructed on it. One resident said beacons and signposts were planted all over their land. “They even planted a beacon in front of my door, which means I am not supposed to be there,” he said. “We are surrounded by beacons and there are beacons planted inside some bomas [homesteads].” Another resident had a similar experience when the government divided up land his family had used for decades and built houses for more than two dozen households from the NCA, and infrastructure to serve them, without consulting him or his family. They are left with their boma and surrounded by newly resettled residents.

He said:

I was born here. My grandfather was born here. ... We are a family of about 72 with grandparents, wives, children. There is not enough land to feed everyone in our family. Now, we depend solely on our cows, which we keep far away from here because there is no place to pasture. Some family members have moved to urban areas for work because of the lack of access to farmland.

He added that the village’s land had been registered with the relevant authorities, with official documents confirming his right to the land. The district and regional commissioners were not swayed, “They all say we are trespassers, and that our village was registered by mistake.”

As of July 2023, the government had relocated families from the NCA into houses in the Msomera sub-villages of Tongoji Ormoti and Orokung’u, and it had started constructing more houses, starting in Kati Kati sub-village. Kati Kati residents told Human Rights Watch they had seen people “coming and looking” in the same way that government officials had done before the construction of houses in the other sub-villages had begun. One resident only knew his farm was taken because of the government construction:

My farm will be taken. The next phase is to develop the area where I have my farm. I know because they built water pumps on the land and that is not normal. There has been no communication from the government, and I am not allowed to say a thing.

Clashes between Existing and Newly Relocated Residents

Msomera residents told Human Rights Watch that the relocation of people from the NCA has resulted in clashes between the two communities, as access to land for cultivation and pasture has become increasingly limited. “The relationship with the people from Ngorongoro is so bad,” an existing resident of Msomera said. “They take our places, our farms, our homes.” Several described an incident in which a Msomera resident was arrested “because she fought with another woman [that had relocated to Msomera from the NCA] for cultivating on her land.”

These residents said they had not received any information from the authorities about compensation for the loss of their land to resettled Ngorongoro residents.

Tanzanian laws and regulations provide for compensation that is “full and fair.”[184] Under Regulation 7 of the Land (Assessment of the Value of Land for Compensation) Regulations 2001, compensation for loss of interest in land includes the value of unexhausted improvements, disturbance allowance, transport allowance, accommodation allowance, and loss of profits.[185]

Maasai Relocated from Ngorongoro Conservation Area

NCA residents relocated to Msomera said they chose to move because of the difficulties they and their families encountered in the NCA due to government restrictions imposed over time, most recently since February 2022.

Other challenges for relocated families include the head of household designation for registering to relocate, which reinforces unequal power dynamics linked to who decides whether the family remains or relocates, inadequate consultation in respect of housing in Msomera, inadequate compensation for relocated people, and poor access to water.

Registration Criteria for Relocation

For the relocation process, the government uses a head of household criteria assuming that all members of a household are similar, without differing needs and wants, and does not reflect the complex nature of households, many of which are polygamous, multi-generational, and multi-household. The head of household designation may also inadvertently give the decision-making power to men, reinforcing restrictive, harmful social and gender norms that automatically consider men to be heads of household, and providers for the household and primary decision-makers over land issues, while women are expected to follow them.

In the NCA, the head of household registers the family at the NCAA or the office of the district or regional commissioner, indicating their readiness to relocate to Msomera. Regardless of the desires of the other members of the household, the family’s homestead is destroyed after relocation because “in the Maasai society, if the husband decides, even when wives do not agree, they all have to move,” according to a member of the Ngorongoro Pastoral Council who is familiar with Maasai customs.

Relying on one person to register the family creates serious challenges both for members of the same household who want to remain in the NCA and for those who chose not to. Residents said family members who chose to remain in the NCA became homeless and forced to move in with extended family members. Wives who refused to follow their husbands may be stigmatized by their community. During a group interview in Endulen, one man told the story of one wife’s refusal on account of being excluded from the decision-making:

A man engaged in the process without sharing any information. One of his wives refused to go because she was not involved in the decision. [The] government moved the husband, other wives, and their children. This broke up the family. It happened recently.

The group identified seven other women across villages in the NCA who had experienced a similar situation and had refused to move with their husbands.

There is no indication that the government’s relocation and resettlement planning incorporated a gender, equity, and social inclusion perspective to eliminate reinforcing inequality between men and women.

Inadequate Consultation Resulting in Culturally Inadequate Housing

The resettlement package being offered by the authorities does not reflect the complex nature of Maasai families. NCA residents, including those who had moved to Msomera and those who remained, said they had no input on the houses provided for their families, which were ultimately inadequate for the size of their families and their cultural way of life.

A traditional leader from the NCA explained:

Moving to Msomera will be problematic for our culture. You go to Msomera and you have a small house with three rooms: you will be living with your wife, children, and your children’s wives, and grandchildren. In Maasai culture, this is a taboo and very prohibited. It’s like killing culture.

Providing only one house to the head of the relocated household and their wives and family members is culturally inappropriate for Maasai families. One woman said, “We got only one [house], and we are two wives. Two Maasai wives cannot live in one house.”

Human Rights Watch visited Msomera in June 2023. The houses are designed in a standard prefabricated style made of brick walls, metal roofs, and a satellite dish antenna. The houses are small, with two to three rooms, designed for a nuclear family of three to five people.

Some of the resettled Maasai residents told Human Rights Watch that the houses were not adequate for the number of people in their multi-generational and multi-family units, and that there is no room for future expansion if their family expands.

One woman said:

When we were leaving Ngorongoro, my son had two houses, and when we were registering to leave, my son was away. On the day of leaving, my house and my son's house were demolished. We came here, and my son has not received compensation. We live together with his family and his children. There are two families living in one house with three rooms.

Residents said they have complained to the authorities about their housing difficulties, but the government has not taken action to remedy the situation. At the time of Human Rights Watch’s visit to the area, some residents had spent personal funds to extend the houses. One resident had built a larger brick house on their allocated plot, and others built or were planning to build multiple traditional houses in the style of Maasai bomas.

Despite being notified of problems with the current setup, the government has continued to construct new houses based on this initial model and expanded the project to two districts. A government spokesperson was quoted in the media: “The second phase [of construction] started in July [2023] all through March, with the aim of building 5,000 houses in the entire area, including Sauni, Kitawi, and Msomera. … in this second phase, we expect to build at least 5,000 houses, of which 2,500 will be built in Msomera, 1000 in Sauni, Kilindi District, and 1,500 in Kitawi, Simanjiro district.”

Inadequate Compensation

Relocated NCA residents told Human Rights Watch that the cash the government gave them was insufficient to cover their expenses while resettling in Msomera, some of which was used to build extra houses to accommodate wives and sub-family units.

A resettled resident said:

A lot of money has been spent on preparing the farms – clearing the bushes has cost a lot of money. Starting farms is very expensive, it is not suitable to farm without putting up a fence, there are animals like elephants, donkeys, dogs, and if you farm, they pass by and destroy the crops. You have to put up a fence with these thorny trees. It is very expensive.

Another resettled resident described the difficulties they faced after building a house:

I don't have any capital left. We spent all our money building a house for the young [relative] who has no home, and my children are in school. We also miss Ngorongoro because even if it doesn't rain, and we don't farm, we can sell goats since they thrive there. We educate[d] our children, and the water is good [in the NCA], but we cannot drink the water from Msomera because it has too much salt.

The government has allocated only two acres of land to each household relocated from the NCA. This acreage is significantly smaller than the extensive grazing land that was available in the NCA, and in stark contrast to collective common resource nature in NCA, and pastoralism. A member of the Ngorongoro Pastoral Council highlighted the communal nature of pastoralism and how the government’s individual-focused approach ran contrary to the pastoralist way of life:

As pastoralists we have a little land for crop cultivation and the rest is communal. But the government resettlement plan gives you two acres for your house and three to five acres for cultivation. People receive cash compensation according to how well they are capable of negotiating. In Msomera, they have a school, police station, but nothing [for their] livelihood.

He said: “Rather than talking with individuals, the government should speak with the community.”

A government spokesperson told the press that for each relocated family the government provides:

1. A three-room house on two-and-a-half-acres, and five-acres for farming and livestock keeping, with land title deeds or ownership documents.

2. 10 million shillings ($ 3,700), though he noted that before moving the residents, the government evaluates their property for compensation.

3. Transport for all their properties to the new village.

Poor Access to Water and Loss of Livestock and Crops

Access to water has been a major challenge for the new residents of Msomera, who depend on water for their livestock and crops. The extended dry season in 2021 and 2022 with little or no rainfall affecting the region may have decreased water availability.

Some of the resettled residents told Human Rights Watch that the cows and goats they brought with them from Ngorongoro had died since they arrived in Msomera. At least half of the crops they planted on their government-allotted farmland failed. They blamed low rainfall, lack of perennial streams, and the poor-quality water in the area for their losses.

At least two resettled residents said the only available water was salty, and that the high salt levels may have contributed to the death of their livestock and the failure of their crops.

Human Rights Watch did not conduct water testing in the area to ascertain the salt levels or causal link with the death of livestock or crops.

Albert Msendo, the Handeni district commissioner, told Human Rights Watch that the government has provided tanks and pumps that can provide up to a total of 500,000 liters of water for use by people and livestock and they are digging more deep wells in the area. The government also aimed to hand over for community use a water reservoir for livestock in May 2023.





Attacks against Critics of Relocation

You’re not allowed to say anything. Even here, people come, but they have fear in their hearts. — Samson L., Msomera, June 24, 2023.

The Tanzanian government has systematically silenced critics of its relocation exercise, contributing to a climate of fear. NCA and Msomera residents and human rights defenders told Human Rights Watch they cannot publicly speak out for fear of reprisals from the authorities.

Arrests of Human Rights Defenders

NCA residents who are opposed to relocation and organized to raise awareness about it, said that the authorities threatened and at times arrested them for criticizing the government’s actions. “They normally threaten us,” said one community leader. “We get a lot of calls. They say, ‘Why are you talking about the government?’ But we don’t care.”

On June 30, 2022, the authorities arrested Simon Saitoti, a ward councilor in the NCA, and charged him with killing Garlius Mwita, a policeman, on June 10 in the neighboring Loliondo division, north of the NCA. A few weeks earlier, Saitoti had circulated a report",HIGH,20240731T071500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Samson L., Mary I., Simon M., Simon Saitoti",Tanzanian Government,"Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA) and Msomera village, Handeni district, Tanga region, Tanzania","Immediate cessation of relocations, meaningful consultation with affected communities, restoration of social services in the NCA.","Forced relocation of Maasai communities from Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA) without free, prior, and informed consent, constituting forced eviction and violation of human rights.",Tanzania,"Government prioritization of conservation and tourism over Indigenous rights, historical patterns of marginalization, colonial land use policies"

Photos on social media picked up in the Turkish media on July 17 featured a warm welcome in Türkiye for two faction leaders of the Syrian National Army (SNA), a loose coalition of armed opposition groups Türkiye sponsors in areas of northern Syria it occupies. In one photo, the two leaders are welcomed by Devlet Bahçeli, leader of Türkiye’s Nationalist Movement Party (Milliyetçi Hareket Partisi, MHP), the main coalition partner supporting President Erdoğan’s government, and in another they are posing with a convicted Turkish mafia leader. The photos are a stark reminder of Türkiye’s failure to rein in abuses by groups it supports.

Bahçeli and Alaettin Cakici, the convicted mafia boss, separately met with commanders Saif Abu Bakr and Mohammad al-Jassem, who have both been accused by the United States of perpetrating and overseeing egregious abuses by their respective factions, the Hamzat Division and the Sultan Suleiman Shah Brigade. The abuses include unlawful killings, abductions, torture, extortion, sexual violence, and property seizures.

They and their factions are both subject to US sanctions and al-Jassem, also known as Abu Amsha, was even investigated by a coalition of SNA factions in December 2021. The coalition said he was responsible for crimes against civilians, including threats, intimidation, assault, and robbery. Both men continue to lead their factions undisturbed, as do others accused of abuses. And areas of northern Syria under their control remain lawless and insecure.

This is, in large part, precisely because Türkiye has long fostered an environment of impunity in the areas it occupies in northern Syria. A February 2024 Human Rights Watch report documented atrocities committed by various factions of the SNA, including the Hamzat and Sultan Suleiman Shah factions. These include abductions, unlawful detentions (including of children), sexual violence, and torture. Additionally, the report highlights widespread looting, pillaging, and property seizures, and reveals the failure of accountability measures to curb these abuses or provide restitution to victims.

Photo ops like this demonstrate that Türkiye is not only uninterested in addressing these abuses but appears to celebrate and embolden the very individuals responsible for them. Bahçeli’s public association with the two faction leaders undermines efforts to hold them accountable and signals tacit approval, or official tolerance, of their actions.

A standoff at Israel’s Sde Teiman military base this week has thrown longstanding abuses against Palestinian detainees and the Israeli military’s history of impunity for torture into stark relief.

On July 29, Israeli military police arrested nine Israeli soldiers at the base on suspicion of “severe abuse” of a Palestinian detainee. News reports said the man was admitted to the hospital with broken ribs and life-threatening injuries to the anus and lungs.

Soldiers barricaded themselves inside the base to prevent the arrests. Protesters against the arrests, including members of Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, pushed their way through the perimeter fence. When security forces removed the nine soldiers, protesters went to the Beit Lid military base, where the soldiers were eventually taken for questioning, and breached its perimeter as well.

Arrests of Israeli soldiers for abusing Palestinians are rare. From 2017 to 2021, just 0.87 percent of complaints against soldiers led to prosecutions, according to the Israeli rights group Yesh Din.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as well as Israel’s defense minister and the military chief of staff condemned the clashes at the two bases, though not the alleged torture of the detainee. Israel’s justice minister criticized detaining for questioning soldiers he said were performing a “holy job.” The finance minister and the national security minister both tweeted “hands off our reservists.” The Knesset’s foreign affairs and defense committee chair slammed “this despicable pursuit of our fighters.”

Since June, Israeli authorities have been transferring Palestinian detainees from Sde Teiman to other facilities due to reports of abuse. But the transfers, and investigations into some cases, are a grossly insufficient response to reports of “widespread torture” and ill-treatment at Sde Teiman. Rights groups cite beatings, stress positions, surgeries without anesthesia, sexual violence, and the prolonged cuffing of arms and legs. An Israeli doctor working there wrote in April that in one week, “two prisoners had their legs amputated due to handcuff injuries, which unfortunately is a routine event.”

The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights also reported waterboarding, electrocution, and the detention of healthcare workers, girls, and a woman over 80-years-old with Alzheimer’s disease. One man said Israeli soldiers fired a nail gun into his knee. At least 53 Palestinians have died in custody since October 7.

The Supreme Court of Nepal has ruled that Rukshana Kapali, a transgender woman, should be legally recognized on all documents as a woman without having to submit to medical verification. The judgment is the latest in the court’s history of progressive rulings on sexual orientation and gender identity, which has earned Nepal a positive global reputation on LGBT rights.

Following a 2007 supreme court order, authorities have been issuing some documents listing gender as “other” or “third gender” for more than a decade on the basis of the person’s self-identification. Despite the court order, the lack of a clear central policy has created problems. Trans people in Nepal today who want to change their gender markers to “female” or “male” are typically forced to undergo surgery, which requires traveling outside the country, and then in-country medical assessments, including invasive examinations of post-operative genitals. Even people who are attempting to obtain documents marked “other” are subjected to this humiliating and unnecessary medical scrutiny.

The Yogyakarta Principles – drafted and signed in 2006 by a group of experts, including a former Nepal parliament member and LGBT rights advocate Sunil Babu Pant – state that each person’s self-defined sexual orientation and gender identity is “integral to their personality” and is a basic aspect of identity, personal autonomy, dignity, and freedom. The principles are clear that gender recognition may involve, “if freely chosen, modification of bodily appearance or function by medical, surgical or other means.” These principles were the basis of the Supreme Court of Nepal’s 2007 order and are cited in Kapali’s new court victory as well.

Kapali, a trans woman law student, has sued the government of Nepal over 50 times since 2021 – pushing for rights-based legal recognition of gender identity. And while this recent judgment sets a precedent for trans rights, the order only applies to Kapali, meaning others will have to petition courts to be legally recognized according to their gender identity.

A better solution is a central policy. The government can and should make the system work for everyone by issuing a directive that allows people to self-identify their gender on official documents, without medical or other verification.",MEDIUM,20240731T213000Z,Rukshana Kapali,"Rukshana Kapali, Sunil Babu Pant",Government of Nepal,"Patan, Kathmandu, Nepal",Government should issue a directive for self-identification without medical verification,Failure to provide legal gender recognition without medical verification,Nepal,Lack of clear central policy on gender recognition

(Brussels) – A Guinean court on July 31, 2024, convicted Guinea’s former self-declared president Moussa Dadis Camara, and seven others, in a landmark trial for rapes and killings of protesters in 2009, Human Rights Watch said today. The court also decided to reclassify all of the charges from ordinary crimes to crimes against humanity, based on a request by the prosecution. This is the first time crimes against humanity have been prosecuted in Guinea.

This trial for a massive attack on peaceful protesters in a stadium in the capital, Conakry, is the first of its kind involving human rights violations on this scale in Guinea and has captured the nation’s attention. The judges found Moussa Dadis Camara, Aboubacar Diakité (Toumba), and Moussa Tiégboro Camara (Tiégboro) guilty under the principle of command responsibility for the crimes against humanity of murder, kidnapping, sexual violence, and torture, among others, and sentenced both Dadis Camara and Tiégboro to 20 years in prison, and Toumba to 10 years.

“This verdict offers long-awaited justice for victims and survivors nearly 15 years after the brutal abuses of the 2009 stadium massacre, the effects of which continue to haunt them,” said Tamara Aburamadan, international justice counsel at Human Rights Watch. “The verdict sends a message loud and clear to those responsible for serious crimes in Guinea and elsewhere that justice is possible, and the trial should yield lessons to prompt national justice efforts globally.”

The judges also found five others guilty of committing various crimes against humanity, ranging from murder to sexual violence and torture, among other crimes, and ordered sentences ranging from 10 years to life in prison. The judges acquitted four men.

The judges also ruled on reparations claims, awarding between 200 million to one billion Guinean francs (approximately US$23,000 to $115,000) for the different groups of victims, including those who have suffered physical and psychological trauma.

Lawyers registered with the Guinean Bar Association decided to boycott all hearings throughout the country until July 31 in protest of the enforced disappearance of members of the opposition coalition. As a result, both the defense lawyers and lawyers representing victims were not present during the reading of the verdict, based on Human Rights Watch’s monitoring.

During the 2009 assault, security forces opened fire on a peaceful protest. More than 150 people were killed and dozens were raped. Security forces then engaged in a cover-up, burying bodies in mass graves. The trial began on September 28, 2022, and lasted almost two years, during which judges heard from more than 100 victims, 11 accused, and over a dozen witnesses, including high-level government officials. The convicted men have 15 days to appeal, while the prosecution has two months.

Guinean authorities should step up security measures after the verdict to ensure the safety of victims and witnesses, in particular those who testified in the trial, from any possible reprisals, Human Rights Watch said.

The landmark domestic trial of the brutal 2009 massacre provides important lessons not only for Guinea but also for other governments seeking to deliver justice for serious crimes under international law,” Aburamadan said. “The duty to investigate and prosecute serious crimes lies first and foremost with domestic authorities. It is crucial for national authorities and their international partners to step up efforts to pursue justice.""",VERY HIGH,20240731T213000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Moussa Dadis Camara, Aboubacar Diakité (Toumba), Moussa Tiégboro Camara (Tiégboro)",Moussa Dadis Camara and others,"Stadium in Conakry, Guinea","Guinean authorities to ensure safety of victims and witnesses after the verdict, emphasis on domestic prosecution of serious crimes.","Crimes against humanity including murder, kidnapping, sexual violence, and torture during the 2009 massacre of pro-democracy protesters",Guinea,"Political repression, military junta’s actions"

(Brussels, August 1, 2024) – The European Commission's 2024 Rule of Law Report, published on July 24, 2024, misleads readers about the state of the rule of law in Greece at a time when media freedom and civic space face dire threats and attacks, 14 human rights and media freedom organizations said today.

The overly positive account in the report starkly contrasts an alarming reality experienced by journalists, activists, and civil society organizations on the ground, and a growing international concern over the deterioration of the rule of law in the country, which was highlighted by 17 human rights and press freedom groups in a February 2024 letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

The European Commission’s report, ignores a stark discrepancy between the Greek government's self-reported data and alarming accounts submitted to the European Commission by civil society organizations and journalists. It disproportionately focuses on positive developments, without weighing them against the broader systemic issues and ongoing violations. This raises concerns about the Commission's willingness to confront the depth of the crisis in a European Union member state, and uphold the rule of law and fundamental rights in Greece.

By glossing over critical issues in Greece facing the media and civil society, the European Commission’s findings risk emboldening the Greek government's crackdown on independent media and civil society, the groups said.

Greece consistently ranks last among European Union countries in the Reporters Without Borders World Press Freedom Index. In February 2024, the European Parliament adopted a resolution expressing, “grave concerns about very serious threats to democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights” in Greece.

While the Commission’s Rule of Law report acknowledges issues with the independence and resources of the media regulator, the independence of public service media, access to information, the persistence of threats to journalists’ safety, and the potential chilling effect of strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPPs) and harassment, including by politicians, it fails to grasp the severity of the ongoing crisis, the groups said.

The report highlights some positive developments and legislative changes such as decriminalizing the offense of simple defamation, however inadequately reflects chronic flaws with implementation of past reforms and deep-rooted systemic issues that continue to erode media freedom.

Journalists are intimidated and harassed by invasive state surveillance, including through the use of commercial spyware, abusive legal actions, and coordinated online smear campaigns, often instigated or amplified by pro-government actors. These tactics not only erode journalists' ability to work freely but also endanger their lives, safety, and the confidentiality of their sources.

This is compounded by this week’s supreme court’s prosecutor decision clearing all Greek state agencies or any state official of responsibility for the use of Predator spyware against dozens of prominent individuals, including journalists, despite documented evidence of their involvement.

Impunity for those who threaten and harass journalists exacerbates the hostile environment for journalists in Greece as concrete action plans or investigative protocols are not implemented. This week’s acquittal of suspects in the 2021 killing of journalist Giorgos Karaivaz, leaving his death unsolved, further perpetuates the climate of impunity for crimes against journalists in Greece. A lack of media pluralism, including inappropriate government control over state media, and collusion between media owners and political interests lead to a pervasive climate of censorship and self-censorship, which further distorts the media landscape and undermines journalistic independence.

Civil society organizations and human rights defenders, particularly those working on migration issues, also face significant obstacles, and even criminal charges, for their work in Greece. The European Commission in the report does not adequately address the detrimental effect of these chilling tactics on freedom of expression and association in Greece.

The incoming European Commission should take a stronger stance on upholding its commitment to fundamental rights and democratic values in member states, including publicly condemning specific instances of press freedom restrictions, civil society crackdowns, or rule of law violations.

The people of Greece deserve a free press, a vibrant civil society, and a government that respects the rule of law, the groups said.

(New York) – Pakistani authorities should exercise restraint in responding to demonstrations in Balochistan province, release all detained for peaceful protest, and restore internet access, Human Rights Watch said today.

Since July 28, 2024, Pakistani authorities have detained hundreds of people in response to the Baloch National Gathering, a march seeking to raise awareness of human rights concerns in Balochistan. Some protesters reportedly attacked security forces, killing one soldier and injuring others. Baloch activists have alleged that government security forces have used excessive force to prevent protesters from reaching the port city of Gwadar, the end point of the march. Government authorities have imposed an internet shutdown on Gwadar.

“Pakistani authorities should uphold the right to peaceful protest and assembly, and when nonviolent means prove ineffective use only the minimum force needed,” said Patricia Gossman, associate Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “It’s vitally important for the authorities to protect protesters’ rights while preventing the situation in Balochistan from spiraling out of control.”

The Baloch National Gathering has called for accountability for the numerous cases of enforced disappearances in Balochistan over many years. Such “disappearances” have long been a feature of the conflict between the government and armed militants in Balochistan. Pakistan’s security forces have also carried out enforced disappearances to silence peaceful critics of the government.

The nongovernmental organization Human Rights Commission of Pakistan reported that some of the march’s organizers received threats to call off the march or face arrest or enforced disappearance. Since July 28, protesters have blocked roads, demanding the release of detained colleagues.

The United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials provide that security forces must never use excessive force. In dispersing violent assemblies, firearms may only be used when other less harmful means are not practicable but must still be used to the minimum extent necessary. Law enforcement officers may only intentionally resort to lethal force when strictly unavoidable to protect life.

Government authorities generally claim that internet shutdowns are necessary to protect public safety and curb the spread of misinformation. However, this sweeping measure denies ordinary people access to lifesaving information, interferes with access to health care, and restricts the ability of journalists to upload photos and videos documenting the government response to the protest. International human rights law prohibits broad, indiscriminate, and indefinite restrictions on fundamental freedoms, including the right to free expression and to provide and receive information, Human Rights Watch said.

The Pakistan government needs to address the issue of enforced disappearances, which are considered to be a continuing offense. International law defines an enforced disappearance as the detention of anyone by state forces or their agents who refuse to acknowledge the detention or whereabouts of the person, placing them outside the protection of the law.

Activists in Balochistan say that there have been 7,000 enforced disappearances in the province since 2004. Since March 2011, Pakistan’s Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances has received thousands of complaints of enforced disappearances across the country. The victims are most often from the marginalized sections of society, and once forcibly disappeared are often at risk of torture and extrajudicial execution. The government has not held anyone responsible for disappearances accountable.

“Balochistan has the highest number of enforced disappearances in all of Pakistan, with the authorities willfully ignoring calls for accountability for years,” Gossman said. “The authorities should end these abuses, prosecute those responsible, and provide redress for the victims and their families.”",HIGH,20240731T170000Z,Human Rights Watch,Patricia Gossman,Pakistani authorities,"Balochistan province, particularly Gwadar","End abuses, prosecute responsible parties, provide redress for victims and families",Use of excessive force against peaceful protesters and enforced disappearances,Pakistan,Conflict between government and armed militants; lack of accountability for enforced disappearances

(New York) – The Taliban have created the world’s most serious women’s rights crisis since taking power in Afghanistan on August 15, 2021, Human Rights Watch said today. Afghanistan is also experiencing one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, with aid severely underfunded, thousands of Afghans forced back into Afghanistan from Pakistan, and thousands of others expecting to emigrate to Western countries still waiting.

Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is the only country where girls are banned from education beyond the sixth grade. The Taliban have also violated women’s right to freedom of movement, banned them from many forms of employment, dismantled protections for women and girls experiencing gender-based violence, created barriers to them accessing health care, and barred them from playing sports and even visiting parks. The United Nations special rapporteur on Afghanistan, Richard Bennett, has described the situation as “an institutionalized system of discrimination, segregation, disrespect for human dignity, and exclusion of women and girls.”

“Under the Taliban’s abusive rule, Afghan women and girls are living their worst nightmares,” said Fereshta Abbasi, Afghanistan researcher at Human Rights Watch. “All governments should support efforts to hold the Taliban leadership and all those responsible for serious crimes in Afghanistan to account.”

Since January 2024, the Taliban have detained women and girls in Kabul and other provinces for what they call “bad hijab” – that is, for not abiding by the prescribed dress code. UN experts have reported that some of those detained have been held incommunicado for days and subjected to “physical violence, threats and intimidation.” In addition to intensified restrictions on women’s and girls’ rights, the Taliban have severely curtailed freedom of expression and the media and have detained and tortured protesters, critics, and journalists.

The cutoff in development assistance has helped to create Afghanistan’s humanitarian crisis. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has reported that more than half of the population – 23 million people – face food insecurity. Women and girls are among the most seriously affected. The UN humanitarian response plan for 2024 is underfunded; as of August, donor countries had contributed only 12 percent of the funds needed.

The loss of foreign assistance has severely harmed Afghanistan’s healthcare system and exacerbated malnutrition and illnesses resulting from inadequate medical care. Taliban restrictions on women and girls have impeded access to health care, jeopardizing their right to health. The Taliban’s education bans guarantee future shortages of female health workers, Human Rights Watch said. Donor countries need to find ways to mitigate the ongoing humanitarian crisis without reinforcing the Taliban’s repressive policies against women and girls.

More than 665,000 Afghans have arrived in Afghanistan from Pakistan since September 2023, having been forced out during a Pakistani government crackdown on foreign immigrants and refugees. Many had lived in Pakistan for decades. The numbers have added to the millions who have been internally displaced in Afghanistan and have strained existing humanitarian support.

Thousands of Afghans who fled the country after the Taliban takeover live in limbo in Iran, Türkiye, the United Arab Emirates, and other countries as resettlement processes in countries that pledged to take in Afghans, including the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and Canada, have been slow and inadequate to the needs of at-risk Afghans.

“The third anniversary of the Taliban’s takeover is a grim reminder of Afghanistan’s human rights crisis, but it should also be a call for action,” Abbasi said. “Governments engaging with the Taliban should consistently remind them that their abuses against women and girls and all Afghans violate Afghanistan’s obligations under international law. Donors should provide assistance aimed at reaching those most in need and crafting durable solutions to Afghanistan’s humanitarian crisis.”",VERY HIGH,20240811T233000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Fereshta Abbasi, Richard Bennett",Taliban,Afghanistan,"Increased international aid without supporting Taliban policies, rigorous accountability measures for human rights violations.",Systematic discrimination and violation of women's rights,Afghanistan,"Taliban's ideologically motivated policies, cutoff in foreign aid"

The last two weeks in the UK have seen a whiplash mood swing from horror to hope.

In response to racist and Islamophobic misinformation shared online, far-right riots sprung up in multiple cities. Racist mobs targeted mosques and asylum seeker accommodation, they attacked Muslims and people of color, and police were injured.

The scenes were truly appalling: packs of thugs in the streets, spreading violence, smashing windows, and setting fires. At some points, police seemed overwhelmed, it was getting out of control, more riots were threatened.

And then, the mood in the streets flipped 180 degrees. Thousands of people joined peaceful counterprotests across the UK in support of tolerance, unity, and inclusion. The majority had spoken, and the message was straightforward: the violent thugs do not represent us. We reject their hate, and we deplore its consequences. It was great to see.

While the immediate threat needs to continue to be addressed, the government should start thinking about the lessons: what have we learned to help keep hateful violence at bay in the future?

First, politicians’ words matter. For far too long, prominent politicians like former UK Home Secretary Suella Braverman and media magnet and now member of Parliament Nigel Farage have been driving dangerous anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric. They are hardly the only ones, of course.

In recent years, far-right language has flooded mainstream politics. The political scapegoating of vulnerable groups unfortunately “works” to a degree, particularly when people see rising inequality and want someone to blame. Some folks oddly believe unscrupulous politicians who tell them all their problems are the fault of some (usually powerless) people cast as “outsiders.”

The mainstream media has also been willing, even eager, to demonize certain communities and groups. All this only emboldens extremists, opening the door to violence.

Second, online disinformation is a serious problem. It played a significant role in the riots. Policymakers need to focus on how easily social media platforms can be harnessed to promote hate.

It wasn’t just unknown individuals spreading lies and rumors on social media, either. The owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Elon Musk chimed in with misguided and ignorant interventions.

It all raises serious questions about how these platforms are managed.

Third, people power matters. It’s true there’s a significant group of individuals who can be fueled by hatred so much they are willing to commit violence. However, they are dramatically outnumbered by those who are rightly appalled by the idea.

For years, this tolerant majority has too often been overshadowed by attention-seeking politicians and media outlets pushing hatred. The pushback we’ve seen from the public in this instance is encouraging. Going forward, we need to see it more often and sooner. And the louder, the better.",HIGH,20240812T144500Z,The public and counterprotesters,"Suella Braverman, Nigel Farage, Elon Musk",Far-right groups and politicians,Multiple cities in the UK,"Focus on addressing online disinformation, promote tolerance and inclusion, hold politicians accountable",Inciting violence through racist and Islamophobic rhetoric,UK,"Political scapegoating, mainstream media complicity, online disinformation"

When veteran journalist Elyes Gharbi announced on June 28 that he was leaving the “Midi Show” on Tunisia’s leading radio station, Mosaïque FM, after nine years, he did not explain why. However, Gharbi’s decision came just months after he acknowledged “unbelievable threats” against journalism in the country and a year after police investigated him for comments made on the show.

As Tunisia gears up for its first presidential election since President Kais Saied’s 2021 power grab, authorities are stifling dissent, especially in the media. Human Rights Watch found that at least five media professionals are currently behind bars for their work or opinions. According to the National Syndicate of Tunisian Journalists (Syndicat National des Journalistes Tunisiens, SNJT), at least 39 cases have been brought against journalists for their work since May 2023, including under the repressive decree-law 2022-54 on Cybercrime and the 2015 counterterrorism law.

In May and July 2024, prominent journalists Borhen Bsaies and Mourad Zeghidi, as well as lawyer and pundit Sonia Dahmani, were sentenced to one year in prison under the cybercrime law. At the end of July, a Tunis court of appeals reduced Bsaies and Zeghidi’s sentences to eight months in prison. Last year, Noureddine Boutar, director of Mosaïque FM, was detained for three months and accused of “money laundering,” “conspiracy,” and “terrorism,” including for alleged incitement against President Saied. Police also recently questioned executives of other private broadcasters as well as the independent outlet Nawaat.

This clampdown is gradually wiping out criticism and diversity of opinion from Tunisia’s media landscape. Political debate has almost disappeared from the airwaves. Private radio IFM and Carthage+ TV channel have suspended their most popular shows that had featured the imprisoned Dahmani, Bsaies, and Zeghidi, as well as IFM’s “90 minutes,” whose host, Khouloud Mabrouk, was questioned by police about her journalism in April. Mabrouk said the show’s premature end was partly due to “pressure.”

Public media journalists have been fighting against censorship and to safeguard their public service mission since President Saied started purging their leadership in 2021. His government appointed new leadership, including to Tunis Afrique Press (TAP), the Tunisian national news agency, who have sometimes revived old authoritarian habits.

Survivors and relatives of victims of a 2004 attack on the Gatumba refugee camp in Burundi have filed criminal cases against alleged perpetrators in their home countries of Burundi, Rwanda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The complaints, which allege genocide and crimes against humanity, are an effort to secure justice two decades later. The lawyer involved in these cases said this information has also been communicated to the International Criminal Court in the Hague.

On August 13, 2004, the National Forces of Liberation (Forces nationales de libération, FNL) targeted mostly Banyamulenge refugees—Congolese Tutsi from South Kivu province in eastern Congo—at the Gatumba camp, close to the Congolese border. More than 150 civilians were killed and another 106 were injured. The refugees had fled fighting in Congo. The FNL, a predominantly Hutu Burundian rebel movement, fired upon and burned to death the Banyamulenge refugees, while sparing refugees from other ethnic groups and Burundians also living in the camp.

Human Rights Watch research at the time found that the Burundian armed forces failed to intervene, even though the slaughter took place within a few hundred meters of military camps. Soldiers of the United Nations peacekeeping force were unable to protect the refugees because they only learned of the attack when it was over.

The FNL claimed responsibility soon after the massacre. Several years later, however, its then-spokesperson, Pasteur Habimana, denied making that statement. In 2009, the armed group disarmed and became a political party, marking the end of the civil war.

In 2004, Burundian authorities issued arrest warrants for two FNL leaders, including Agathon Rwasa, a prominent opposition figure. However, he was never arrested. In September 2013, judicial authorities announced the opening of a case against Rwasa for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Gatumba, but proceedings were delayed indefinitely.

The new complaints explicitly implicate Rwasa and Habimana, according to the lawyer involved in the cases.

This is an update to our January 2023 pre-sessional submission[1] and includes updated information on the right to free and compulsory education and the right to reproductive health care.

Right to Free and Compulsory Education (articles 2, 3, and 13)

The Constitution of Malawi and the Education Act state that primary education shall be free and compulsory.[2] Primary education begins at age 6 and lasts eight years.[3] According to the 2020-2030 investment plan for Malawi’s education sector, one of the government’s objectives is “increasing access to secondary education and transition from primary to secondary with a long-term view of having free and compulsory secondary education.”[4] Malawi Vision 2063 (MW2063) further calls for making at least 12 years of formal education compulsory, and prioritizing early childhood education for all.[5]

According to the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), tuition fees and transport and accommodation costs have created significant barriers in accessing secondary education in Malawi.[6] Although enrollment at the primary level, when education is tuition-free, stands at 98 percent, one of the highest in the region,[7] government data indicates that net enrollment at the secondary level, when education is not guaranteed to be free for all, was only 17 percent in 2022/23, and the completion rate was 22 percent (24 percent for boys and 20 percent for girls).[8]

In particular, the lack of sufficient or adequate school infrastructure, amenities, and other facilities, such as sanitation and changing rooms, reportedly create barriers for girls at the secondary level.[9]

Girls constituted 59 percent of dropouts from secondary education in 2022/23. Most of the students who dropped out (42 percent) reportedly did so because of their inability to pay school fees, followed by 13 and 12 percent, who did so due to pregnancy and marriage, respectively.[10]

Moreover, only 43 percent of children who first registered in primary schools in Malawi had received a pre-primary education, which is also not guaranteed to be free for all.[11]

Teenage pregnancy and child marriage as barriers to realizing the right to education

Although Malawi has prohibited child marriage and adopted a school readmission policy to ensure girls can resume their education after giving birth,[12] implementation remains a challenge, according to a recent study by the Forum for African Women Educationalists (FAWE).[13] Reasons include lack of awareness of government law and policy, deeply entrenched social and cultural norms regarding teenage pregnancy and child marriage, poverty and inability to pay for school materials, and gaps in implementation of the readmission policy.[14]

FAWE reported that some girls may feel pressured to engage in sexual relations in exchange for money to buy school materials such as books and uniforms. Parents from poor households may also encourage their teenage daughters to marry for economic reasons and therefore see it as an “acceptable practice.”[15]

Another study that reviewed demographic and health survey reports from 1992 to 2016 identified a strong causal link between teenage pregnancy and adolescents’ lack of access to sexual and reproductive health information and services. Only 13 percent of girls ages 15-19 had accurate information about fertility, and only 25 percent knew about emergency contraception. Twenty-two percent of married adolescents ages 15-19 had an unmet need for contraception. This unmet need was significantly higher among non-married adolescents in this age group. Consequently, the rate of adolescent pregnancy had barely changed in the country since 1992.[16]

Awareness of relevant laws and policies among parents is also limited, which is compounded by weak enforcement by lower-level government agencies and haphazard implementation at the school level. For example, counselling and psychosocial services after readmission have been insufficient.[17] Most schools also do not have copies of the readmission policy, nor the forms required to readmit a student after giving birth, as per the policy.[18] And even though policies are available on the Education Ministry website, most rural schools do not have computers or access to the internet. There is also inconsistent implementation of the duration of maternity leave and the date of return to school. However, most teachers reportedly insist that the student return at the start of the first term.[19]

Human Rights Watch has found that complex re-entry processes or stringent conditions for readmission can negatively affect parenting children’s willingness to return to school or ability to catch up with learning.[20]

Human Rights Watch recommends that the Committee ask the government of Malawi:

What steps is the government taking to increase enrollment and completion rates within compulsory primary education?

What steps is the government taking to reduce and eventually eliminate direct and indirect school fees at the secondary level?

What barriers does the government envision to expanding the right to free and compulsory education to include at least one year of pre-primary education?

What is the timeline to legislate 12 years of free primary and secondary education?

What steps is the government taking to monitor school dropouts due to pregnancy or child marriage and support learners who drop out to return?

What steps is the government taking to raise awareness among parents, schools, and communities of relevant education laws and policies such as the school readmission policy, including those located in rural areas?

Human Rights Watch encourages the Committee to call on the government of Malawi to:

Legislate that at least one year of pre-primary education be free and compulsory, and that all secondary education be free, for all children.

Develop and implement mechanisms to follow up on and keep track of students who drop out of school, including due to pregnancy or marriage, with the aim of initiating their return to school.

Adopt an unconditional positive continuation policy that outlines schools’ obligations to safeguard the right to education for married, pregnant, and parenting children and older students, and monitor implementation. Pregnant students should remain in school for as long as they choose to, and not be prescribed rigid compulsory leave after giving birth.

Adopt and implement a comprehensive sexuality education curriculum for both primary and secondary school students that is non-judgmental, age-and-stage- appropriate, scientifically accurate, and evidence based, and ensure that all teachers have the necessary training and support to deliver this curriculum.

Provide access to adolescent-responsive sexual and reproductive health services.

Provide access to information to parents, guardians, and community leaders about the harmful physical, educational, and psychological effects of adolescent pregnancy and the importance of pregnant girls and parenting children continuing their education.

Consistently provide sufficient school-based counselling services for students who are pregnant, married, or parenting.

Continue to combat the practice of child marriage through national strategies, in collaboration with women’s and children’s rights groups, health professionals, and other service providers, and coordinate efforts among all relevant ministries.

Right to Quality, Dignified, and Respectful Reproductive Health Care (article 12)

Maternal mortality in Malawi stands at 381 deaths per 100,000 live births, placing Malawi among the 25 countries with the highest maternal mortality rates in the world.[21] This rate persists despite 96 percent of women in the country having skilled birth attendance and 97 percent delivering in health facilities.[22] The 2017-2022 National Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) Policy posits that persisting high rates of maternal mortality and morbidity despite the increase in access to antenatal care (ANC), post-natal care (PNC), and skilled birth attendance point to poor quality care in health facilities.[23]

The link between high maternal deaths and poor quality of maternal health care is evident in the data collected from management, staff, and patients of the healthcare facilities in the Quality of Care for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health Network (“the QoCN”).[24] The data identified the following inadequacies in the health system that relate to the quality of care: lack of training and motivation among healthcare providers resulting in absconding as well as unprofessional, disrespectful, and, sometimes, abusive treatment; lack of adequate healthcare workers and support personnel; lack of adequate infrastructure including buildings, equipment, and commodities; lack of data to inform processes and procedures; lack of leadership; and disruptive events such as the Covid-19 pandemic.[25] This network has had some successes in improving the quality of maternal health care in the country. Research conducted between 2018 and 2019, a year after the establishment of the network, found that more women and girls began to receive quality maternal health care. Specifically, women and girls reported more instances of encountering healthcare providers who are present and sufficiently trained and who treat women and girls with professionalism, care, and concern, and in a manner that respects their rights to dignity, information, and bodily autonomy.[26]

However, many women and girls still experience poor quality maternal health services. In particular, women and girls still experience obstetric violence when seeking antenatal care, intra-partum care, and post-natal care. Obstetric violence—violence, abuse, and mistreatment meted out against pregnant women and girls in healthcare facilities when they seek reproductive health services[27]—thrives in healthcare systems that face the structural issues listed above. A 2019 report by the Office of the Ombudsman found that women and girls in public hospitals are subjected to negligence by healthcare providers; neglect during labor, delivery, and the post-partum period; delays in receiving care when they arrive at health facilities; non-consensual medical procedures; and medically unnecessary procedures.[28]

Abortion is criminalized and heavily restricted in Malawi.[29] Additionally, the government has failed to enact the Termination of Pregnancy Bill, which was proposed by the report of the Law Commission on the Review of the Law on Abortion in 2016.[30] Consequently, women and girls are forced to resort to unsafe abortion, which is responsible for 17 percent of maternal mortality in the country and even more morbidity.[31] Human Rights Watch research in other countries with harsh abortion restrictions has shown that criminalization fuels obstetric violence.[32] In these contexts, women and girls seeking care for abortions, miscarriages, or other reproductive healthcare concerns are often subjected to mistreatment, long delays in care, and violations of patient-provider confidentiality. Some are denied pain management as “punishment.”

The 2023 review of the QoCN identified the following health system challenges, which align with the findings of the Ombudsman’s report: inadequate infrastructure including old buildings and outdated equipment; inadequate resources; high rates of staff turnover; failure to sustain the use of online resources such as the Continuous Professional Development program; and cultural resistance to implementing new healthcare standards.[33]

Many of these challenges may be caused or exacerbated by the government of Malawi’s lack of public funding for its healthcare system. According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), Malawi spent the equivalent of only 1.36 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on health care through public means in 2021, the most recent year for which data is available.[34]

This falls far short of the 5-percent-of-GDP public healthcare spending indicator that the WHO uses to assess governments’ investment in health care, and which is associated with greater achievement towards universal health coverage and related healthcare goals fundamental to the realization of the right to health.[35] Recent analysis of these WHO data conducted by Human Rights Watch reiterated this lack of support for the public healthcare system, finding that Malawi’s public healthcare spending as a percent of GDP declined by about one-fifth during the Covid-19 pandemic (between 2019-2021). Meanwhile, out-of-pocket healthcare spending, which can create discriminatory barriers to health care based on income, increased by about the same margin over this period, rising to the equivalent of about 1.05 percent of GDP in 2021.[36]

Malawi’s public healthcare spending also falls far short of its commitments under the 2001 Abuja Declaration, in which African Union governments set a target of allocating at least 15 percent of their national budgets to improve health care — in 2021, the most recent year for which data from the WHO is available, Malawi allocated only 5.76 percent of its national budget towards health care.[37]

Obstetric violence also thrives in contexts where the substance of laws and policies or the methods of implementation of these laws and policies is not responsive to the realities of women and girls. For instance, in Malawi, by-laws created and enforced by chiefs to encourage women to seek timely and skilled maternal antenatal and intrapartum care and discourage the enlisting of traditional birth attendants have ended up having a punitive effect on women. While these by-laws vary from village to village, there are some elements that are common across various villages. For instance, by-laws mandating the attendance of at least one antenatal care visit within the first trimester of pregnancy; by-laws requiring the attendance of spouses or partners during antenatal care visits or, where a spouse or partner is not present, a letter from the chief justifying the absence of the spouse or partner; by-laws requiring spouses or partners to provide the supplies needed for child birth such as baby clothes, blankets, soaps, and razors; and by-laws that require women to deliver at healthcare facilities. Where these by-laws are broken, various fines are imposed such as paying a chicken or a goat or money, which can amount to 25,000 Malawian Kwacha (US$25). These by-laws have had the effect of facilitating and justifying verbal abuse, arbitrary detention, and denial of services that leads to preventable maternal morbidity and mortality.[38]

Human Rights Watch recommends that the Committee ask the government of Malawi:

What measures is the government taking to prevent and address obstetric violence?

What measures is the government taking to address the violations raised in the 2019 report from the Office of the Ombudsman, Woes of the Womb?

What measures is the government taking to address the challenges faced by healthcare facilities and healthcare providers in its 2023 Quality of Care for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health Network (QoCN) report?

What measures is the government taking to increase its public healthcare spending, including to meet its commitments under the 2001 Abuja Declaration to allocate at least 15 percent of its national budget to improve health care?

What steps is the government taking to prevent unsafe abortion?

Human Rights Watch recommends that the Committee call on the government of Malawi to:

Implement relevant sexual and reproductive health laws and policies including the Gender Equality Act, National Health Policy, the Quality Management policy and the Malawi National Reproductive Health Service Delivery Guidelines.

Put in place budgetary, administrative, and programmatic measures to address obstetric violence including creating awareness among women, girls, and healthcare providers regarding obstetric violence as a maternal health violation and ensuring obstetric violence is addressed as a structural problem affecting human rights.

Implement the recommendations from the 2019 report from the Office of the Ombudsman, Woes of the Womb.

Ensure that all women, girls, and pregnant people can access safe, legal, abortion care to the fullest extent of the law including through creating public awareness, as well as information, education, and communication materials and resources on the existing legal provisions regarding access to safe, legal abortion and addressing stigma relating to abortion care.

Review the 2016 Termination of Pregnancy Bill proposed in the report of the Commission on the Review of the Law on Abortion, to ensure that it effectively addresses the current challenges that women and girls face when seeking abortion care and, thereafter, enact and implement it.

Set a goal to spend through domestically generated public funds the equivalent of at least 5 percent of GDP or 15 percent of general government expenditures on health care, or an amount that otherwise ensures the dedication of the maximum available resources for the realization of rights, including the right to health.

Summer is here and it's the season of wedding parties throughout Türkiye. But for some Kurdish men, women, and children, joyful dancing and singing of Kurdish political folk songs at wedding parties or elsewhere has ended in arrest and charges of “spreading terrorist propaganda.” This crime is punishable with up to five years in prison. The actions of the authorities in detaining and criminalizing people for such lawful activities constitutes a clear abuse of arrest powers.

A TikTok video of women dancing a halay — a line dance common in Türkiye — at a wedding party to a song mentioning guerilla fighters became the pretext for police to detain six people in the town of Kurtalan in the Siirt province in southeast Türkiye on July 26. The Siirt governor issued a statement on social media announcing the detentions and pledging that the “struggle against terrorist organizations will continue with perseverance and determination.” One woman and three girls were remanded by the court to pretrial detention. A day before, in the southern city of Mersin, police detained eight men and one boy on the basis of a TikTok video showing people dancing a halay to Kurdish songs weeks earlier. A court ruled that the nine be placed in pretrial detention. Arrests in other cities and towns including Istanbul and most recently Osmaniye have followed, and at least 34 people have spent weeks in pretrial detention before appearing in court.

The case of those arrested in Mersin is yet to reach trial, but the three women and two girls in the Kurtalan case face their first trial hearing in Siirt on August 16. The prosecutor should request the immediate release and acquittal of all five.

The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that singing popular folk songs or poems, shouting generic slogans, including at public gatherings, or referencing the 40-year insurgency of the armed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) against the Turkish military, is protected speech. The content of the songs and slogans from the wedding parties and elsewhere neither incites violence nor creates an imminent danger to individuals that could warrant criminal charges.

Turning Kurdish wedding parties into crime scenes by arresting and prosecuting guests and musicians is only the latest example of how for decades the Turkish authorities have perverted the criminal justice system to target legitimate activities and political expression by Kurds.",HIGH,20240815T220000Z,Turkish authorities,"Six detained individuals in Kurtalan, eight detained in Mersin","Kurdish men, women, and children","Kurtalan, Siirt province, and Mersin",Request immediate release and acquittal of detained individuals.,Spreading terrorist propaganda,Türkiye,Targeting Kurdish identity and expression

Thousands of Indians have taken to the streets to protest the rape and murder of a doctor in a government hospital in Kolkata city last week. They are demanding justice and better security and facilities at medical campuses and hospitals.

The attack has cast a spotlight on how millions of Indian women remain exposed to abuse in the workplace and continue to face severe barriers to justice for sexual violence.

On August 9, a 31-year-old trainee doctor was found dead in a seminar room. News reports said she had fallen asleep in the classroom after a grueling 36-hour shift because there was no designated rest area for staff. The autopsy showed her body bore severe injuries, including fractures, suggesting a brutal assault. A male hospital volunteer worker has been arrested.

India has laws such as the POSH Act to address violence against women and protect them from sexual harassment in the workplace. The laws against rape and sexual abuse were strengthened after a 2012 gang rape and murder in Delhi sparked nationwide protests.

However, the authorities have failed to effectively enforce the law or ensure complaint committees tackle sexual harassment in both the formal and informal sectors.

While most private sector companies and government offices have set up internal complaint committees, many exist only on paper. Employers do little to improve workplace culture by raising awareness about what constitutes sexual harassment and consequences for such behavior.

Many protesters alleged that the Kolkata hospital’s administrator blamed the victim and attempted to cover up the crime. A mob attacked the hospital to disrupt protests, renewing concerns over barriers faced by victims and their families in cases of sexual violence. Federal investigators are now investigating the case.

Meanwhile, the West Bengal state chief minister has demanded the “hanging of the guilty” by August 18. Imposing the death penalty may have popular appeal after such a horrific crime, but it won’t protect girls and women from abuse and violence. That requires systemic reforms, including better enforcement of laws and protections in public spaces as well as in the workplace and in institutions. Human Rights Watch opposes all use of the death penalty.

Update: On August 15, 2024, a court in Hanoi sentenced Nguyen Chi Tuyen to five years in prison.

(Bangkok) – The Vietnamese authorities should immediately drop all charges and release the prominent rights activist Nguyen Chi Tuyen, Human Rights Watch said today. Hanoi police arrested Nguyen Chi Tuyen on February 29, 2024, for criticizing the government on social media. He was charged under article 117 of the penal code, which criminalizes “making, storing, disseminating, or propagandizing information, materials and products that aim to oppose the State.”

Click to expand Image Nguyen Chi Tuyen carries a No-U banner (No to China’s Nine Dash Line) at Ky Quan San Peak, Vietnam. © Private

Nguyen Chi Tuyen’s trial is scheduled for August 15 at a court in Hanoi. If convicted, he faces up to 12 years in prison.

“Vietnam’s authorities have targeted Nguyen Chi Tuyen for expressing views they don’t like,” said Patricia Gossman, associate Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The government should stop jailing peaceful critics, repeal its draconian penal laws, and end the systematic violation of basic rights.”

Nguyen Chi Tuyen (also known as Anh Chi), 50, is a rights campaigner who uses YouTube, Facebook, and other social media to comment on social and political issues. His primary YouTube channel, Anh Chi Rau Den, has produced over 1,600 videos and has 98,000 subscribers. His second YouTube channel, AC Media, has produced more than 1,000 videos and has almost 60,000 subscribers.

Nguyen Chi Tuyen was a founding member of the now closed No-U FC (No U-line Football Club), a soccer team whose members were outspoken against China’s territorial claims on maritime areas claimed by Vietnam. He helped organize and participated in many anti-China protests in the early 2010s, and pro-environmental protests in the mid-2010s. He joined fellow activists to provide humanitarian assistance to impoverished people in rural areas and victims of natural disasters.

He also openly supported imprisoned rights activists including Pham Doan Trang, Can Thi Theu, Nguyen Tuong Thuy, Nguyen Huu Vinh (also known as Ba Sam), and Nguyen Lan Thang. Prior to Nguyen Lan Thang’s trial, Nguyen Chi Tuyen published an open letter in support of his friend. He wrote, “The only thing we did was to act in accordance with our conscience, speak up our thoughts, our desire, our longing.”

Nguyen Chi Tuyen has repeatedly faced police intimidation, harassment, house arrest, bans on international travel, arbitrary detention, and interrogations. In May 2015, five unidentified men attacked and beat him near his house in Hanoi. The attack left him with injuries that required stitches on his face.

Despite the risk of prosecution on politically motivated charges, Nguyen Chi Tuyen continued his campaign for human rights and democracy. In a 2017 interview in Mekong Review, he said, “[Communist Party officials] have all the power in their hands. They have prisons, they have guns, policemen, army force, the court: they have everything. They have media. We have nothing except our hearts, and our minds. And we think it’s the right thing to do … that’s all.”

Nguyen Chi Tuyen’s trial occurs just as To Lam takes office as Vietnam’s newly appointed Communist Party general secretary. To Lam served as head of Vietnam’s notorious Ministry of Public Security between April 2016 and May 2024, during which the Vietnamese police arrested at least 269 people who had peacefully exercised their basic civil and political rights.

“The Vietnamese government will remain mired in oppression so long as it continues to lock up dissidents like Nguyen Chi Tuyen who dare to speak their minds,” Gossman said. “Vietnam’s international donors and trade partners shouldn’t have any illusions when dealing with this rights-abusing government.”",HIGH,20240814T013000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Nguyen Chi Tuyen, Patricia Gossman, To Lam, Pham Doan Trang, Can Thi Theu, Nguyen Tuong Thuy, Nguyen Huu Vinh, Nguyen Lan Thang",Vietnamese authorities,"Hanoi, Vietnam","Drop all charges against Nguyen Chi Tuyen, repeal draconian penal laws, end systematic human rights violations",Arrest and imprisonment of rights activist for criticizing the government on social media,Vietnam,"Systematic violation of basic rights, political repression"

Over the past week, Tanzanian police have arbitrarily arrested 375 members and supporters of the country’s main opposition party, the Party for Democracy and Progress (Chama cha Demokrasia na Maendeleo, or Chadema). Among them are former presidential candidate Tundu Lissu, party chairman Freeman Mbowe, party youth wing leader John Pambalu, and several journalists. The arrests took place ahead of the party’s planned August 12 International Youth Day celebration in the city of Mbeya.

On August 11, the police announced they were banning the event because it was intended to “breach the peace.” They cited a recent statement from a Chadema youth wing mobilization coordinator that referenced the recent youth-led protests in neighboring Kenya. The authorities did however allow another International Youth Day celebration organized by the ruling party to occur two days earlier in Zanzibar.

The police said on August 13 that they released Lissu, Mbowe, and other party leaders without criminal charges following questioning. But this clampdown was a bad sign as Tanzania prepares for local elections later this year and general elections in 2025.

When Samia Suluhu Hassan took office after President John Magufuli’s death in March 2021, she took some measures to improve Tanzania’s human rights record. Attacks on basic rights had escalated under Magufuli, including a violent crackdown on the opposition around the October 2020 general elections.

However, progress has been inconsistent. In July 2021, police arrested Mbowe and 11 other Chadema members ahead of a conference to discuss reforms of the country’s constitution. Mbowe was held on terrorism charges in pretrial detention for seven months before being released. In 2023, authorities arrested and threatened dozens of critics of a government agreement concerning management of the country’s ports. The government has also yet to prosecute any security force personnel for killing at least 14 people and injuring another 55, as well as beating opposition supporters, in Zanzibar during the 2021 elections.

The rights to freedom of association and peaceful assembly are safeguarded by the Tanzanian constitution and the regional and international treaties that the country has ratified.

Shelter and interim housing can have great value in getting people off the streets and into safer situations. However, shelter and interim housing do not meet the standards for housing spelled out by international human rights law. As Los Angeles lacks an adequate stock of permanent housing, people can remain in these deficient living situations for extended periods of time, or they leave and return to houselessness.

City officials use the existence of shelter and interim housing to justify, both legally and morally, implementation of criminalization policies—they can say that they offered “housing” before destroying an encampment and scattering its residents. They can move a certain number of people indoors, while the vast majority remain on the streets facing increasing enforcement of laws that punish their existence in public.

According to international human rights law, permanent housing means a place to live that is not temporary or time limited and that meets standards of habitability, affordability, accessibility, and security of tenure. The services agency and city officials have very little permanent housing to offer; instead, they offer various forms of shelter, including hotel rooms, primarily through the Project Roomkey (PRK) and Inside Safe programs, congregate shelters, A Bridge Home (ABH) shelters, Tiny Home Villages, and Safe Camping, which provide space in gated lots for people to set up tents. Despite this variety of options, there is not nearly enough shelter for everyone living on the streets. PRK, for example, peaked in August 2020, sheltering just over 4,472 people; one year later the program only served 1,392 people and continued to decline.

While these shelter situations allow some people to get off the streets and many who stay in them are grateful, they are temporary solutions, at best. Living conditions range from comfortable to uninhabitable. Many people refuse to enter congregate and other shelters due to lack of privacy, safety concerns, and unsanitary conditions. All the shelter options have degrading and even draconian rules that may include curfews, searches upon return to one’s room, prohibitions on guests, pets, and even partners or spouses, limits on keeping property, and other restrictions. Many unhoused people compare the conditions to being incarcerated.

The shelters have not led consistently to placements in permanent housing. City and county officials tasked with optimizing a system to rehouse people calculate that a successful system must have five permanent units for every one interim or shelter bed. This ratio allows a steady flow of people from the streets to shelter to housing. Los Angeles has far fewer permanent units than needed, and so the system stalls. Without that flow, people either stagnate in the shelters or they leave. When people leave, returning to the streets, new shelter beds are available, but these extremely expensive programs have not made a dent in the unhoused population.

The shelter or interim housing system has facilitated criminalization. The ABH shelters are surrounded by Special Enforcement and Cleaning Zones (SECZ) in which city policy empowers and housed neighbors expect police to enforce laws against unhoused people and where, more prominently, LASAN conducts repeated destructive sweeps. Human Rights Watch analysis of LAHSA data shows evidence supporting claims that in advance of high-profile encampment sweeps, city officials held hotel rooms empty so that they could show the public that they were placing people from those encampments into rooms rather than simply scattering them to other unsheltered situations. In doing so, they underutilized the rooms and left others, from less visible locations, unsheltered.

Officials often justify the cruelty of encampment destruction by claiming they have successfully “housed” people, when at most they have moved people into shelter options, often taking rooms from more vulnerable people who need to be indoors. Sweeps of lower profile encampments typically do not even result in shelter placements, especially as shelter beds are also scarce.

Despite the grave need to develop more permanent housing to effectively move people out of houselessness, policymakers in Los Angeles have trended towards prioritizing interim shelter over permanent housing, directing scarce resources away from the long-term solution.

Inside Safe and the Bass Administration Approach to Houselessness

The mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, has publicly made houselessness her administration’s top priority and has promised a new approach that will solve the problem. She has issued orders declaring a “state of emergency,” and required city agencies to speed up the process of approving affordable housing developments.

Housing developments funded through Proposition HHH, passed by voters in 2016, should become ready for occupancy and allow for more permanent placements, though they are a finite resource. Measure ULA, a voter-approved tax on property sales over $5 million earmarked for permanent housing development and tenant protections, will give the mayor additional funds. She has promised to access federal and state resources.

However, despite her public pronouncements Bass has been prioritizing interim housing and shelter over permanent housing and has allowed criminalization to continue unabated. She has allocated $250 million to her signature program, Inside Safe, which mobilizes LASAN and police to destroy encampments permanently, while moving their residents to hotel rooms on a temporary basis. As with PRK, many people are grateful to get indoors, while others resent being forced into rooms that often have severe habitability problems. Officials have required people to surrender much of their property for destruction as a condition of accepting the hotel rooms. People who have declined to move into hotel rooms face destruction of their property and banishment from locations where they had been living. While touted as a pathway to housing, very few people have left the hotels for permanent situations—more have returned to houselessness.

As of September 2023, there were only about 1,100 Inside Safe rooms available, requiring choices about who would be placed in them. The Bass administration selection process has prioritized publicly visible encampments as opposed to setting aside rooms for people with the most need. This prioritization appears to be driven by City Council office preferences and complaints from housed neighbors, rather than helping the most vulnerable.

Housing Solves Houselessness

Housing people solves houselessness. Helping people retain their homes prevents inflows to houselessness. Developing and preserving affordable housing allows more people to stay housed and reduces housing precarity that leads to houselessness. Upholding and increasing tenants’ rights empowers them to maintain their housed status. Housing is different from temporary shelter or even “interim housing.”

Most unhoused people simply need a permanent, affordable, habitable place to live. Some people with disabilities need housing with a spectrum of support services attached, often called “permanent supportive housing” or PSH. Ample experience shows that providing PSH to “chronically” unhoused people—those with disabilities who have been on the streets for over a year—is extremely effective, with one-year retention rates around 90 percent. The Housing First model, in which people are housed voluntarily and without requirements of sobriety or treatment compliance, has been successful in a wide variety of jurisdictions in allowing people to stabilize and remain housed.

There are a variety of approaches to housing, each with relative benefits and drawbacks. Prominently, the federal government provides vouchers under the Section 8 program that allows tenants to pay 30 percent of their income in rent while the government pays the rest. There are not nearly enough vouchers for all who qualify for them; people with vouchers often cannot find places to stay due to discrimination and bureaucratic barriers; vouchers do not increase the overall number of affordable units. But, for those who do find housing with them, vouchers have greatly improved their lives.

Non-profit housing developers produce and manage permanent housing and PSH, despite a highly inefficient financing system and an overall shortage of funds. Advocates are calling for Los Angeles officials to convert hotels and unused commercial buildings to affordable housing, and to create land trusts that remove properties from the speculative market so that they can provide permanently affordable housing. While public housing, permanently affordable and financed entirely by government, has been demonized and starved of funding in the US, it can be an effective approach to delivering the right to housing.

Compared to criminalization and prioritization of temporary shelter, which do not solve houselessness, providing permanent housing is cost effective over the long-term, including through savings from reduced reliance on emergency services, lower court and jail costs, and reduced direct expenditures for sanitation, temporary shelter, and police interventions. The intangible human benefits of replacing policies grounded in cruelty with policies of care make housing production and preservation an obvious choice.

Human Rights Watch has documented numerous cases of people who were housed successfully after periods of houselessness. The positive change in the life circumstances of each of these people points to a way forward that will benefit unhoused people as well as housed people and will increase the value of communities in Los Angeles.

Relevant International Human Rights Law

International human rights law recognizes the right to adequate housing. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) articulates and international treaties including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) enshrine this right. The US has signed, but not ratified these treaties, creating an obligation not to undermine their purpose and object. Implementing criminalization while neglecting to guarantee housing for all undermines the right.

The right to adequate housing, as defined by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, is not simply the right to shelter, but to housing that, at minimum: 1) has legal security of tenure; 2) has facilities, like water, sanitation, and site drainage, essential for health, security, comfort, and nutrition; 3) is affordable, without compromising other basic needs; 4) is habitable; 5) is accessible, accounting for disabilities and reasonable accommodation; 6) is located in a place accessible to employment, education, health care, and other social facilities; 7) is culturally appropriate.

The US has signed and ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), obligating it to uphold the right to housing in the context of combating racial and ethnic inequity. The long history and current policies of racial discrimination that have led to the prevalence of Black houselessness call for remedial and reparative actions.

Criminalization in all its forms violates the right to life, liberty, and security of person and prohibitions against “cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment,” found in International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) also prohibits cruel and degrading treatment. The US has signed and ratified both treaties, obligating it to comply with them. The UN Human Rights Committee has interpreted policies that punish life sustaining activities, like sleeping, as potentially cruel and degrading treatment. The ICCPR protects against arbitrary arrests, including arrests for the status of being unhoused.

As criminalization exposes Black and Brown people disproportionately to arbitrary arrest and cruel treatment, it may violate the ICERD’s mandate to end discriminatory policies and to mitigate racial harms, regardless of discriminatory intent.



Key Recommendations

As housing is the only proven solution to houselessness, Human Rights Watch calls on Los Angeles city and county governments, the state of California and the US federal government to affirm a right to adequate housing as defined under international human rights law and invest sufficient funds to progressively realize this right. To achieve this right, we recommend developing and preserving sufficient housing that is permanently affordable to low-income people, such as through use of creative approaches like community land trusts and converting unused government and commercial properties to housing. Most immediately, to help slow the spread of houselessness, the city and state should find ways to protect existing tenancies and prevent evictions, while also protecting others' rights.

Because houselessness has increased as government has diminished social safety nets, including the county’s General Relief payments, a basic income program for extremely poor residents, and the federal government’s scaling back of welfare programs, Human Rights Watch recommends restoring and enhancing social protection for all, including through universal social security and systems that ensure access to quality affordable health care for all. The state of California and city and county of Los Angeles should provide voluntary, community-based mental health care for all people, while avoiding systems of involuntary care and detention.

This report details how present and historical racial discrimination, often legally mandated or allowed, has led to highly disproportionate houselessness among BIPOC and especially Black communities. Human Rights Watch urges local, state, and federal governments to reverse laws and policies that have disproportionate negative racial impacts, to direct resources into low-income BIPOC communities that have traditionally been neglected, and to make reparations for past harms.

Given the historical emphasis on arresting and citing unhoused people for existing in public spaces, as detailed in this report, the City of Los Angeles should repeal laws that specifically criminalize unhoused people and discontinue targeted enforcement of other laws specifically against them. The state of California should pass a law forbidding local jurisdictions from enforcing laws punishing people for living in public spaces. Ending this direct form of criminalization will mitigate its cruel impacts while freeing up resources and directing political will to focus on effective solutions based on the right to housing.

To mitigate the health hazards of unhoused encampments and to alleviate suffering in the short-term, the City of Los Angeles should provide services, including sanitation, consistent and non-abusive trash removal, toilets and hygiene stations, medical care, and other assistance, to unhoused people living on the streets. LASAN cleanings should not be destructive and should respect people’s property. Further, the city should prioritize scarce shelter beds for those with the greatest health needs who wish to accept those beds.



Methodology

This report is based on research conducted from April 2021 through March 2024. Findings are based on interviews with 148 people, including multiple interviews with many of them. It is based on analysis of data obtained from various agencies within the City and County of Los Angeles as well as databases from other sources. It is based on review of other research studies, news articles, and historical records. All documents cited in this report are publicly available or are on file with Human Rights Watch and available on request.

An integral part of the research involved Human Rights Watch researchers witnessing and documenting actions by city officials and private actors towards unhoused people in Los Angeles. Researchers were present at numerous sweeps and enforcement actions.

Of the people interviewed, 101 gained their expertise on houselessness through the direct experience of living on the streets of Los Angeles. Of those people, 76 were living unsheltered on the streets at the time of the interview; 14 were in temporary shelter, primarily hotel rooms made available through “Project Roomkey” or “Inside Safe;” 10 were in permanent housing after having been unhoused.

Of those 101 people with direct lived experience of houselessness, 55 were male, 44 were female and two were non-binary or did not identify a gender. We did not ask people to identify their race or ethnicity, but about half appeared to be Black and most were people of color.

We did not ask people to state their age, though many did. We attempted to estimate approximate ages to gain a general understanding of interviewee demographics. While accurately estimating ages of people living on the streets is difficult, our best estimate is that 9 of the 100 people we interviewed who had experienced houselessness were between 18 and 29, 48 were between 30 and 54, and 41 appeared or identified themselves as over 55. The oldest who stated their age was 74. The ages of the remaining three were too difficult to estimate.

Disability is prevalent among unhoused people. Some of the 101 interviewees who had experienced houselessness openly stated that they had some physical disability or mental health condition that amounted to a disability. Others showed obvious signs, like walking with a cane or using a wheelchair. Others indicated that they received disability payments. Using these indications, we counted 40 interviewees who had disabilities, 21 of whom were over the age of 50. This number likely underestimates the prevalence of disabilities among the people interviewed.

We found people to interview by meeting them on the streets in Skid Row, Venice, Van Nuys, Downtown Los Angeles, Hollywood, and other locations throughout the city. Community organizers, service providers, and mutual aid workers introduced us to many of them. Most interviews were conducted in person, though some were over the phone or through video conference.

This report uses pseudonyms for nearly all the people interviewed who had personal experience with houselessness unless they specifically asked that their real names be used. We have used pseudonyms to protect people’s privacy, especially given the highly personal and traumatic experiences shared, and to protect people from retaliation by government officials or private individuals.

We interviewed 47 others whose primary expertise was not gained by living on the streets. They included several elected officials and members of other elected officials’ staff; academics whose research involved houselessness and housing policy; lawyers who work directly on issues involving houselessness; people working in government agencies responsible for formulating and implementing policies related to houselessness; service providers outside of government; housing policy experts; nonprofit housing developers; LAHSA outreach workers; housed people living in neighborhoods with unhoused encampments; and community organizers, advocates, and mutual aid workers.

Human Rights Watch reached out multiple times to officials in then-Mayor Eric Garcetti’s administration, but no one would agree to speak to us. The people we contacted included the deputy mayor for Homelessness, the chief of the Office of Homelessness Initiatives, the person responsible for community engagement on Skid Row; the chief housing officer, the director of Interim Housing Strategies. Following Karen Bass’ election as mayor of Los Angeles city in November 2022, her chief of Housing and Homelessness Solutions agreed to a brief interview. Human Rights Watch submitted follow-up questions to the mayor’s staff members responsible for houselessness policy, but has not received responses at time of writing, despite multiple requests. Mayor Bass herself spoke to Human Rights Watch.

We reached out several times to Los Angeles City elected officials as well. Two councilmembers, Mike Bonin and Nithya Raman, spoke to us directly. Councilmembers Joe Buscaino and Katy Yaroslavsky had staff responsible for houselessness speak to us. Councilmember Mitch O’Farrell refused to meet. His staff requested written questions. Human Rights Watch submitted written questions but had received no response at time of writing, and O’Farrell was voted out of office in 2022. Councilmember Kevin De Leon’s staff responded with apparent agreement to arrange an interview, but then did not follow through despite repeated requests.

We reached out numerous times to representatives from the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). The senior lead officers on Skid Row referred us to LAPD’s public information officer (PIO), as did the LAPD homeless coordinator. The PIO took no action despite repeated requests from us, and no officers were willing to speak without the PIO’s approval. Human Rights Watch submitted written questions to the PIO based on our findings but received only a very limited response. We asked the PIO for LAPD’s response to key points of our data analysis. The PIO said that they could not answer without seeing our data. We sent them our data but have not received any response. Human Rights Watch did speak informally to officers at the site of encampment sweeps.

We spoke to current and former LAHSA outreach workers under condition of anonymity. Some of those we spoke to asked that their interviews, or some portion of them, be kept off the record or “on background.”

We disclosed to everyone interviewed the purpose of the interview and the intention of using their information in a report on the criminalization of houselessness.

Data

This report includes extensive quantitative analysis of data gained through the California Public Records Act (PRA). We requested a broad variety of data from various government agencies including the LAPD, City Attorney, LASAN, Mayor’s Office, Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA), and LAHSA, a joint city and county agency. The agencies complied with the requests to varying degrees. When several agencies did not comply adequately, we sued the city, eventually receiving records substantially responsive to our request through settlement negotiations.

The data analysis in this report centers on presenting the activities of each agency through descriptive statistics. All processing and analytical code, as well as raw data and our original PRA requests, are available on Human Rights Watch’s GitHub page.





Key Definitions

Language choices inform policy choices. The words used to describe the societal situations related to houselessness often determine and are determined by how the public understands these situations. That understanding helps determine what policies government and private sectors implement.

Homeless/unhoused or houseless

Over the years, people have used a variety of degrading terms to label people living on the streets, including “transient,” used by LAPD officers.[3] The word “homeless” came into widespread use beginning in the 1980s.

The US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) defines a person as “homeless” if 1) they are “living in a place not meant for human habitation, in emergency shelter, in transitional housing, or are exiting an institution where they temporarily resided [for up to 90 days];” 2) they “are losing their primary nighttime residence, which may include a motel or hotel or a doubled up situation within 14 days and lack resources or support networks to remain in housing.”[4] LAHSA uses this same definition, but adds people fleeing domestic violence without resources to obtain permanent housing.[5] These definitions do not fully account for the many people who lack permanent housing while living doubled-up in over-crowded temporary conditions.

Calling a person “homeless” can serve to deny their place in the community. It feeds into policies that would remove people from communities where they live, since they are considered “homeless” and the community is not their home.[6]

Many advocates use the term “unhoused.” This term responds to the fallacy that people living on the streets do not have a home: they do, it is where they live, even if that is a temporary structure or shelter. What they lack is housing. The term emphasizes that people need housing and not simply temporary shelter.

For purposes of this report, Human Rights Watch will use the term “unhoused” or “houseless” to refer to people who do not have housing that meets the criteria set forth by the UN Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (CESCR) in General Comment No. 4: The Right to Adequate Housing (art. 11(1) of the covenant).[7] This includes people living on the streets, in makeshift structures, in temporary or interim housing or shelters, in overcrowded conditions, and in sub-standard housing. This expansive definition reflects the massive scope of houselessness and the fluidity of housing situations—someone living in sub-standard or overcrowded housing one day may be living on the streets the next; someone living in a tent one day may be in a shelter or hotel room the next.

Because policies of criminalization tend to focus on visibly unhoused people, generally with the intention of removing them from sight, this report emphasizes the experience of unhoused people living on the streets.

Shelter or Housing

The CESCR describes adequate housing as meeting the following criteria: legal security of tenure; availability of services, materials, facilities, and infrastructure, like water, energy, and sanitation; affordability; habitability; accessibility; location accessible to employment, schools, health care and other social facilities; and cultural adequacy.[8]

In drafting the comment, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights said:”[T]he right to housing should not be interpreted in a narrow or restrictive sense which equates it with, for example, the shelter provided by merely having a roof over one’s head or views shelter exclusively as a commodity. Rather it should be seen as the right to live somewhere in security, peace and dignity.”[9]

Policymakers in Los Angeles often falsely say “housing” when they are referring to shelters, tiny homes, “safe camping” zones, hotel rooms with insecure tenure, and other temporary living situations.[10]

In this report, we use “housing” (sometimes “permanent housing”) to refer to a home that meets the definition of adequate housing in CESCR General Comment 4. Interim or otherwise temporary housing, shelter, and other living situations are identified specifically by what they are.

Encampments

While many unhoused people live on their own scattered throughout the city, a large percentage of them come together to form communities of differing sizes.

City officials and advocates usually call these communities “encampments.” Police enforce laws against “camping” in public spaces.[11]

This terminology is misleading and can feed into the public perception that people are unhoused because of their own choices. Camping is associated with a recreational activity--choosing to spend time outdoors. Unhoused people rarely chose to live outdoors. Rather than camping, they are existing or surviving outdoors. While it might feel more appropriate to restrict a person’s ability to “camp,” it is unfair and cruel to restrict their ability to exist.[12]

This report will use the terms “unhoused communities” and “encampments,” but with the understanding that people are living in these communities and not “camping” as a recreational choice. Encampments are communities built by unhoused people themselves on public land without authorization.

Criminalization

The term criminalization in the context of unhoused people refers to laws that in practice punish unhoused people for simply existing in public spaces.[13] While the laws do not explicitly make being unhoused illegal, by targeting unavoidable and natural human actions, they do so in fact. These laws may include bans on sitting or sleeping in public, keeping property in public, being in a park after certain hours, or living in one’s car.[14] They may also include targeted and systematic enforcement against unhoused people of laws that appear less obviously targeted at unhoused people, like trespassing, asking for money, loitering, drinking in public, urinating in public, jaywalking, smoking bans.[15]

Criminalization, as used in this report, also includes orders backed by threat of arrest to move someone from a location (“move-alongs”) or destruction and confiscation of their property and living structures, including through sanitation department clean-ups or “sweeps.”[16] It can also include coercing people into restrictive shelters or “safe camping” zones under threat of enforcement action, and coercing people into mental health treatment or drug rehabilitation facilities.[17]

Sweeps/Cleanups

LASAN has a vital role in maintaining the cleanliness of public space throughout the city. Its function is essential to the health and well-being of all residents.

LASAN has been mobilized to address the unhoused population in both positive and negative ways. To the extent LASAN performs clean-ups at encampments designed to remove waste and hazardous materials, without confiscating people’s property, without destroying the structures they depend on for shelter, and without instilling fear and abuse, their service is extremely valuable. Unhoused people generally welcome such cleanups, when conducted with predictable regularity and notice.

However, a substantial portion of LASAN cleanups amount to wholesale destruction of encampments, confiscation of property, and destruction of property, including clothing, bedding, tents, medications, personal papers, family mementos, and other personal items. As will be discussed in detail, these cleanups, called “sweeps” by unhoused people and advocates, inflict tremendous harm on people and often do not provide effective sanitation. Sweeps may also amount to encampment “clearances” when they result in permanently removing unhoused communities from a particular location.

Los Angeles City/County

The City of Los Angeles is an independent local municipality, with distinct borders, governed by a Mayor and a City Council consisting of 15 council members, each representing their own district within the city. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) has jurisdiction throughout the city, as does the Los Angeles City Attorney. LASAN provides sanitation services throughout the city.

The County of Los Angeles includes the city, but also covers a much larger area and 87 other cities within its borders, along with unincorporated areas. LAHSA is a joint city and county agency.

This report focuses on houselessness and government responses within the City of Los Angeles. However, houselessness does not fit neatly within arbitrary borders. Nor does policy related to houselessness. Los Angeles County initiatives related to housing and services have direct impacts on houselessness in the city.

Because of the frequent intersection of these two distinct jurisdictions, it is not possible to strictly discuss one without reference to the other. While primarily focusing on the city, this report discusses relevant facts related to the county. In some instances, there may be inconsistencies in data due to the inability to distinguish between county and city. This report strives to be clear when discussing data and other facts about which pertain to the county and which to the city.

Interim Housing and Shelter Programs

In recent years, the city and county of Los Angeles and the state of California have initiated a variety of temporary housing or shelter programs designed to address houselessness. This report discusses many of them in detail, including their living conditions and rules, their success in moving people out of houselessness, and, to some extent their cost. This report discusses the relationship of these programs to the larger policy of criminalization.

These programs include:

1. A Bridge Home shelters (ABH): ABH are shelters that house people temporarily in congregate settings but offer everyone their own area, providing some privacy with room dividers.

2. Congregate shelters: These shelters offer large dorm-like settings in which people can stay indoors. Often, they provide cots or mats on which to sleep in open rooms with little to no privacy.

3. Project Roomkey (PRK): PRK was a state and local program in which unhoused people were provided temporary hotel rooms, meals, and some services designed to move them to permanent housing.

4. Tiny Home Villages (THV): THV are gated lots with eight-foot by eight-foot sheds designed to house two people each, with all residents sharing bathroom, shower, and laundry facilities.

5. Safe Camping: Safe Camping set aside gated lots in which people could live in tents with shared bathroom facilities.

6. Safe Parking: Safe Parking facilities are parking lots in which some vehicle-dwelling unhoused people can stay in their cars or vans overnight. Generally, people must remove their vehicles during the day.

7. Inside Safe: Inside Safe, like PRK, offers temporary hotel rooms for unhoused people whom city officials have moved out of encampments. The program promises services and assistance in obtaining permanent housing.





I. Criminalization in Practice: A Case Study

Criminalization, in all its forms, occurs throughout Los Angeles, often in hidden corners of the city with little oversight or attention. The sweep at Naomi Avenue in August 2021 was devastating to the residents of that community and typical of the implementation of such sweeps.

Naomi Avenue: A Little Known Encampment

At 7 a.m. on August 18, 2021, LAPD officers awoke Arturo T. as he slept in the makeshift house he had built under the freeway on Naomi Avenue between 16t and 17t Streets, just south of downtown Los Angeles. They told him that he had 15 minutes to get out of the way before LASAN workers took down the entire encampment.[18]

Arturo had been living at this location on the west side of the street for over a year, along with about 11 other people. Many of them had lived there longer than he had. A similar number of people lived on the east sidewalk across the street. Using scavenged scrap lumber and plastic tarps, they had built structures that provided shelter from the elements, including extreme heat, wind, sun, and cold. They had gathered abandoned couches, chairs, and mattresses to provide comfort and keep their bodies off the concrete sidewalk. They had formed a community of neighbors who provided each other with security and companionship.[19] They cooked meals together and watched out for each other. The area surrounding the encampment is generally light industrial, with few if any residences or retail businesses.[20] Arturo did not waste time. He gathered as many of his possessions as he could and moved out of the way.[21]

The previous week LASAN employees said that they were coming to clean the area soon, but they did not post signs giving official notice or a specific date and time.[22] Over the previous year, LASAN had conducted at least 25 cleanings in the immediate vicinity of the encampment.

Arturo was able to pack some essential possessions before police officers ordered him to stand outside the perimeter that they had marked off with yellow tape. Officers stood next to patrol cars parked at both ends of the block, preventing Arturo and other encampment residents from entering the area to retrieve more of their possessions.[24]

LASAN trucks arrived, including a large flat-bed with a Kubota loader, a trash compactor truck, and a trailer with a portable toilet attached for their workers to use.[25] The city once had put a portable toilet near this encampment for a short period of time, but then removed it, leaving the residents to urinate and defecate in bottles and bags.[26] Because the encampment had no trash cans or dumpsters, a substantial amount of garbage had accumulated around it and its surrounding area. People unconnected to the encampment frequently dumped garbage near where the encampment residents lived, making the situation worse.[27] Months earlier, city officials identified the need for toilets and handwashing facilities to serve unhoused people in this area, but they provided none.[28]

Using the loader and shovels, LASAN workers first demolished the makeshift homes on the east side of Naomi Avenue, then on the west side where they destroyed Arturo’s home and all his remaining property.[29] They heaped his possessions, including bicycles, a television, a bed, a sofa, his clothes and shoes, into the dump truck and crushed them, “like it was worthless.”[30]

They destroyed a brand-new air-mattress, battery packs, food and cookware, as well as paperwork and identification that Lisa G., who lived in the encampment just around the corner on 16th Street, had been storing in a friend’s home in the Naomi Avenue encampment.[31] They only allowed her to remove a backpack and her dog. Another man had his bike, clothing, wife’s clothing, and a small generator taken and destroyed. Another man at the encampment had his work tools, clothing, and his birth certificate destroyed. LASAN took all of an older man’s possessions, including his medications. Others also had their medications destroyed.[32]

The demolition on this day was part of the city’s Comprehensive Cleaning and Rapid Engagement (“CARE+”) program, described as a “full comprehensive cleaning.”[33] General Dogon, an organizer with the Los Angeles Community Action Network (LA CAN), arrived on the scene with Human Rights Watch as it was happening. He questioned the police officers guarding the north end of the block as to why LASAN was destroying this encampment.

Initially, the responding officer said it was because of a law forbidding encampments under the freeway.[34] Later the officer said it was to ensure that the sidewalk was passable in compliance with Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements.[35] However, a few days after LASAN finished demolishing and disposing of everyone’s possessions, structures, and the garbage, they set up a fence on the east side of Naomi Street where 10 to 15 people had lived, and another on the west side, where Torres lived.[36] These fences, which almost entirely blocked both sidewalks, remained in place for about a year and were as much a barrier to people with disabilities as the encampment had been.[37]

According to LASAN records, the “Solids Team” removed around 40 tons of material, about 600 pounds of which they identified as hazardous waste.[38] Much of it was indisputably garbage, but much of it included people’s possessions as described above, their built-up shelters, and furniture essential to create some comfort in a harsh living environment.[39] Sanitation workers are required by protocol to place personal property they have not defined as “hazardous” into bags that are then tagged and transported to a storage facility where they can be reclaimed within 90 days. That day at Naomi Avenue, LASAN did not collect a single property bag, instead destroying everything.

Police officers at the scene told Human Rights Watch that outreach workers had been at this encampment offering shelter placements and services and that some of its residents left with the LAHSA workers.[41] Residents of the encampment denied that any outreach workers had taken people to housing or shelter from this encampment.[42] LAHSA records obtained by Human Rights Watch show that on the day of the demolition, LAHSA contacted one person at the demolished Naomi Avenue encampments, gave that person some food, water, a hygiene kit, and protective masks (PPE), but did not provide or even make a referral for housing or shelter.[43]

LAHSA workers contacted three other people at the immediately adjoining encampment on 16th Street. They obtained “Bridge Housing” for one person that day. This person had been referred to “Bridge Housing” five months earlier, though it is unclear if their placement that day was related to the previous referral.[45] Outreach workers gave one person a tent, then obtained “crisis housing” for that person the following day.[46] Several Naomi Street residents simply moved around the corner onto 16th Street, integrating themselves into an already existing encampment.

LAHSA records from the preceding two weeks further contradict the police officers' claim that they had been assisting people from this encampment with housing. From August 5, 2021 through the day of the demolition on August 18, 2021, outreach workers contacted 5 people from encampments at or within 250 meters of the Naomi Avenue encampment, providing them with food, water, PPE, hygiene materials and other services, but did not refer any to shelter or housing.[48] During the 40-month period from January 1, 2019 until April 22, 2022, LAHSA provided similar services to 53 individuals at these encampments, referred 19 of them to some form of interim housing or shelter, and obtained interim housing or shelter for a total of 3 of them.[49]

Over the next few months, LASAN, with support from the police, demolished the adjoining encampments on 16th Street and set up fences that blocked the sidewalks as they did on Naomi Street, compelling residents to scatter to other places without offers of shelter or housing.[50]

Arturo T., Lisa G., and the others had to absorb the destruction of their homes and property, then move on and start over at some other location.

II. Overview of Houselessness in Los Angeles

According to 2023 estimates, 46,260 people are unhoused in Los Angeles, over 7 percent of the unhoused population of the entire US, and 73 percent of those are unsheltered, living on the streets and sidewalks, in parks or in vehicles.

Black people make up less than 8 percent of the population of Los Angeles, but nearly one-third of unhoused people; a Black person is six times more likely to be unhoused than a white person in Los Angeles.

57 percent of Los Angeles renter households pay over 30 percent of their income for housing, while 270,000 renter households are considered overcrowded, meaning that huge numbers of people are at imminent risk of houselessness.

Older people are increasingly among the unhoused. The 2022 population estimates found 4,323 unhoused people in the city aged over 62 years.

Around the corner from the destruction of the settlement on Naomi Avenue, a row of tents and plywood and tarp structures lined the 16th Street sidewalk alongside the freeway off-ramp. Alice J., a Black woman who appeared to be in her 60s, sat on a tattered couch next to her structure. Chained to the leg of the couch was her dog, who stood up and growled if anyone approached until Alice assured the dog she was safe.[51]

Alice had been living on the streets for three years. She and her husband, a military veteran and a musician, owned their house until he took a loan against it for a business venture that failed, and they lost everything. He died two years later, leaving her on her own. Earlier in 2021, LASAN officials, with police in support, had destroyed her makeshift home. They took her computer, her bicycles, some kitchen equipment she had bought in hopes that she might find an apartment, shoes she had intended to sell to add to her SSI income, and mementos from her late husband. They told her she could get her possessions from the storage facility, but when she tried, they were not there.

Alice watched the Naomi Avenue operation silently anticipating that her home would be next. She had many of her possessions packed up and stacked onto a cart, ready to move if the dump trucks appeared on her street.[53]

Alice is just one of tens of thousands of people living on the streets of Los Angeles. The Greater Los Angeles Point in Time (“PIT”) Homeless Count (“PIT” Count), put out by LAHSA annually, is an estimate of the number of unhoused people, sheltered and unsheltered, living in Los Angeles. Despite significant limitations with its methodology, and critiques that the PIT Count substantially underestimates the number of people without housing, it can provide a baseline understanding of demographics and show increases and decreases in populations.

In 2023, the PIT Count estimated 46,260 unhoused people within the city limits and 75,518 in the county.[56] These numbers marked an approximately 10 percent increase from the 2022 estimates.[57] The city of Los Angeles makes up 1.1 percent of the total US population, but 7.1 percent of the US's unhoused population.

Encampments and vehicle dwellings have become pervasive parts of the Los Angeles landscape. The 2023 PIT Count found 14,096 cars, vans and recreational vehicles, and 9,342 tents or makeshift structures like the one in which Alice lived, housing tens of thousands of people in the county.[59] The vast majority of unhoused people in Los Angeles are “unsheltered,” while across the US most unhoused people are sheltered.[60] The 2023 PIT Count estimated that 27 percent of unhoused people lived in shelters or transitional housing and 73 percent lived on the streets in the city.[61] Almost all of the growth in Los Angeles’ unhoused numbers is due to an increase in the unsheltered population. The 32,680 people estimated living on the streets in 2023 marks a 15 percent increase in unsheltered houselessness in the city from the year before and more than double the number (107 percent increase) from 2009.[62]

While shelters and transitional housing come with their own problems that can make them unacceptable options to many people, living unsheltered on the streets can mean exposure to the elements—especially extreme heat, sun, wind, cold, occasional but brutal rains, and pollution—vulnerability to crime, and being subjected to law enforcement and other actions by city officials. Access to services is more difficult for unsheltered people.

Racial disparities in the unhoused population continues to be extreme, with Black and Native American people vastly overrepresented among the unhoused in relation to their overall population. The proportion of the city’s unhoused population that is Black is over four times higher (33 percent) than that of the general population (8 percent).

Just as Human Rights Watch was completing this report, LAHSA announced the results of the 2024 PIT Count, which showed a .27 percent reduction in the overall unhoused population for Los Angeles County and a 2.2 percent reduction for the city, the first decreases in many years. The number of sheltered unhoused people increased, while the unsheltered population decreased. These results are encouraging and may reflect a heightened attention to houselessness by city and county officials. Human Rights Watch has not had the opportunity to conduct a thorough analysis of LAHSA’s data; nor are we aware of other such analysis produced before completion of this report. The reduction in makeshift shelters, tents, and vehicles used as shelter was over 9 percent, considerably more than the reduction in actual people counted. This difference could suggest that efforts to remove the most visible signs of unhoused communities have made individuals harder to locate and count.

A. Gaps in the PIT Count

One obvious PIT Count limitation is that the estimates are based on one day or, as in 2023, just a few consecutive days in the year, and are not necessarily an accurate estimate of houselessness throughout the year. In Los Angeles, those days are generally in the winter when unhoused people are more likely to use what resources they have to get indoors, even if only very temporarily.[68]

The PIT counts rely on administrative shelter data and a sample of sight-counts of unsheltered people, tents, vehicles and structures.[69] Many unhoused people make great effort to hide themselves in order to avoid law enforcement, vigilantes, or just being exposed to public view, increasing the likelihood those sight-counts will miss them.[70] Law enforcement and sanitation departments may clear encampments ahead of the counts, making people difficult or impossible to find. Incarcerated or hospitalized unhoused people may not be counted.[72] Perhaps most significantly, the count does not include people who are “couch surfing” or squeezing temporarily into overcrowded units who may flow in and out of unsheltered houselessness.[73]

Leaving people who do not have stable housing and are on the verge of being on the streets out of the count means a substantial underestimation of the problem. US Education Department data on unhoused children, counting those living in motels or doubled-up in other people’s homes, indicate a vastly larger number of unhoused people than the PIT counts estimate.[74]

This undercount means that many unhoused people are left out of consideration and that the scale of the problem is minimized; the methodology of counting visibly unhoused people, whether intentional or not, favors policies of criminalization that drive unhoused people out of public view.[75] A jurisdiction that criminalizes aggressively is likely to lower its count because unhoused people will be harder to find.

B. Who is Unhoused in Los Angeles?

Each person counted in these estimates is a human being with individual circumstances and experiences that led them to be unhoused. Each feels pain and joy, love and fear. Every one of them has hopes and desires. Every one of them has essential needs—a stable, secure, comfortable home; food and water; basic hygiene; social interactions; dignity and privacy and more. Every one of them has a human right to an adequate standard of living that meets these needs.

Bobby M., a 70-year-old Black man who has worked as a truck driver, a roofer, and a forklift operator, has been unhoused in the Skid Row neighborhood for many years. [76] More and more older people like Bobby are unhoused in Los Angeles. The 2023 City of Los Angeles PIT Count estimated 12,031 unhoused people over the age of 55, compared to 9,978 in 2020. Over one-quarter of the unhoused residents of Los Angeles are over 55 years old. [78]

Serena C. lives in a tent with her husband and her young adult son in an encampment in Van Nuys near the ABH shelter. She has moved to various encampments and lived in shelters, but she found that their rules separated her from her family. Both she and her husband have physical conditions that prevent them from working. Her son has seizures often triggered by stress. [79] The 2022 City of Los Angeles PIT Count estimated there were 2,306 unhoused family units (having at least one child under age 18), over 90 percent of them sheltered. Families with children make up almost 30 percent of the US unhoused population, according to a 2021 study. Historically, most unhoused families in the US are headed by female single parents.

Carter L.’s landlord evicted him from his Skid Row apartment just before the pandemic lockdown started in March 2020. People stole from him and assaulted him while he was living on the streets near his former home. He went to the Veterans’ Administration in Westwood, since he had been a US Army medic in the 1990s, but they were unable to get him into housing. He moved into a large encampment along San Vicente Boulevard just outside the fence in front of the massive VA campus, along with dozens of other unhoused veterans, while he waited for a housing voucher. The 2022 PIT Count estimated 1,895 unhoused military veterans like Carter in the City of Los Angeles, nearly 80 percent of them unsheltered. [84]

Sandra C. had to leave her home following a dispute with her ex-partner, forcing her to live on the streets. The residents of an encampment south of Downtown Los Angeles welcomed her and she had lived there for about a year when we spoke with her. She fixes bicycles and sells them. She buys food for her neighbors in the encampment when she has money. [85] The 2022 City of Los Angeles PIT Count estimated there were 13,817 unhoused women—about one third of the total population. An additional 534 people included in the count identified as gender non-binary or “questioning” and 703 identified solely as transgender. [86]

Sage Johnson had to leave her home at age 17 to escape an abusive situation. She avoided living on the streets by staying with friends and relatives on their couches or wherever there was space available in the residence. Eventually she found transitional housing with the LGBT Center and permanent housing in West Hollywood. The 2022 City PIT Count estimates 1,681 unhoused “transition aged youth” (TAY)—those between the age of 18 and 24.The 2023 County PIT Count estimated 3,718 TAY among the unhoused population, 932 more than in 2022, including a doubling of the number of unsheltered TAY. [89]

Sally F. came to Los Angeles to escape her abusive husband in 2021. She has seizures that started after he hit her on the head; she has post-traumatic stress, bi-polar disorder, and anxiety. She stays on Skid Row and has survived assault and rape while on the streets. [90] A 2022 study of unhoused women in Los Angeles County found high rates of victimization for harms, including theft (73.8 percent), domestic violence (48.1 percent), and coerced sexual activity (about one-third) throughout their lifetimes. Over 20 percent of women said intimate partner violence caused them to become unhoused. Women and especially trans and non-binary people reported high rates of victimization while living on the streets. Nearly one-third of unhoused men report having experienced intimate partner or sexual violence during their lifetimes. [94]

Edgar S. lives in a tent on 7th Street in Skid Row. After his mother died, his family split apart leaving him with no support. He has bi-polar disorder and anxiety. He has a heart condition. He had a substance use disorder and went to prison for a drug-related offense, losing his Social Security Disability benefits. He now survives on General Relief (GR) payments of $221 per month and Food Stamps. The 2022 PIT Count estimated that 25 percent of unhoused people in the city have a mental health condition with high support requirements, 28 percent have harmful substance use, 12 percent have a developmental disability, and 22 percent have a physical disability.[96] Many, like Edgar, have some combination of these conditions.

C. Black Houselessness

Connie W. is a Black woman in her mid-50s who has been living in Skid Row for the past four years. She stays on the sidewalk near 6th Street, under a tree. For the first two years she lived in Skid Row, she slept on a piece of cardboard, until someone gave her a tent. She appreciates the protection from the sun and rain that the tent gives her, calling it “half-way decent.” She is part of a small community of people who live side by side and look out for each other.

Connie uses a wheeled walker and describes having “crippling rheumatory arthritis.” She is extremely thin and looks frail, appearing to weigh less than 90 pounds, though she says she weighed 174 pounds when she got to Skid Row. She takes marijuana and drinks alcohol to address the constant pain in her bones. She takes medications for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and for voices she hears and feels these medications help her. She found some milk crates and put a mattress on top of them inside her tent, so she does not have to sleep directly on the concrete.

Connie has been on her own since she was 16. She has some schooling and she worked for 25 years in various jobs, including as a janitor, a cement mason, and a cosmetologist. She styles hair for other unhoused women by her tent on Gladys Avenue.

She had her own apartment, with government subsidized rent, for nine years. Connie allowed her niece, who worked for a cable company and was living in her car, to stay with her. The landlord found out and evicted them both, leaving Connie out on the streets. Some of her family members have apartments or houses, but they are already too crowded for her to move in with them.

Connie stayed in shelters, but she found them unbearable. Though she got priority because of her physical conditions, administrators would place her in the day room where she had to sleep on a mattress on a floor full of people as close as two feet away from her. “A person could be snoring or farting right in your face.” She would have to leave the shelter right after breakfast and only could return later in the day.

She got a Section 8 Voucher after becoming unhoused but was unable to find a landlord who would accept her as a tenant within the time limits. She survives on food stamps and $221 a month from General Relief payments.

The Sanitation Department periodically comes by her sidewalk home and makes her pack up her tent and property so they can clean. After they finish, she usually cleans again with soap and bleach. She keeps a broom and dustpan in her tent and tries to keep her area tidy.[104]

Houselessness in Los Angeles is a result of decades of racial discrimination and systemic policies and practices designed to advantage white people and disadvantage Black people like Connie.[105] Black houselessness in Los Angeles is extreme. The 2023 PIT Count estimates that, while Black people make up about 7.6 percent of the overall population in Los Angeles County, they are 31.7 percent of the unhoused.[106] Almost half of unhoused families are Black.[107] Nearly 40 percent of unhoused unaccompanied children and youth aged 18 to 24 are Black.[108] Unhoused older people are disproportionately Black.[109]

Los Angeles has over 15,400 unhoused Black people out of a population of nearly 300,000, nearly 9,000 non-Hispanic white people out of a city population of over 1.06 million and nearly 19,000 unhoused Latinx people out of a population of over 1.82 million. The odds of being unhoused are 1 in 19 for a Black person in Los Angeles, 1 in 97 for a Latinx person, and 1 in 121 for a non-Hispanic white person. Black people in the city of Los Angeles are over six times more likely to be unhoused than white people.

The rates of county houselessness for white, Latinx, and Asian people are all below their share of the overall population, though Latinx houselessness has risen considerably in recent years.[111] Native American and Alaska Native people make up 1 percent of unhoused people in Los Angeles County but only 0.2 percent of the overall population; Native Hawaiian and Pacific Island people are 0.5 percent of those unhoused and 0.2 percent of the overall population.

The Skid Row neighborhood, which has Los Angeles’ most concentrated poverty and houselessness, is primarily a Black community. Black people comprise 56 percent of unhoused people there.[113] Skid Row’s history as a place of containment of unhoused people, and its history of aggressive policing, are significant to understanding the racial dynamics of city officials’ response to houselessness.[114]

D. Precariously Housed People

While the Los Angeles homeless services system has become more efficient at helping people regain housing in recent years, LAHSA reports that every day, on average, 227 more people become unhoused, while only 207 retain housing.[115] People who lose their homes usually do not go directly to the streets: they may move in with a series of friends or family, sometimes called “couch surfing;” they may then move into a vehicle or temporary shelter or a motel before ending up outdoors.[116]

Sage Johnson couch-surfed until she was able to get into a shelter; Connie W. snuck her niece into her apartment until they were both evicted to the streets and shelters.[117] Harvey Franco lost his job due to an illness and could no longer afford his rent. He moved in with relatives until their landlord raised the rent beyond their means and he went out on the streets.[118]

Californian cities, including Los Angeles, have seen the highest growth in home prices in the nation over the past 24 years. Since 2000, the price of a typical home in Los Angeles has more than tripled. Home values in Los Angeles have grown at a 60 percent faster rate than the average for the 50 largest US cities.

Los Angeles currently has the fourth most expensive house market in the US, behind only three other Californian cities. The “typical” home in Los Angeles is currently valued at nearly $1 million, though estimated values differ per neighborhood, ranging from $563,000 in the Watts neighborhood to nearly $4 million in the Bel Air neighborhood.

Rents have also skyrocketed, having increased by 50 percent in the city between 2015 and 2024. Median rent prices were $2,240 for a 1-bedroom and $3,200 for a 2-bedroom in February 2024.

The City of Los Angeles has the highest rate of housing cost burden and overcrowding in the US.[123] A household that pays over 30 percent of its income for housing costs, including rent and utilities, is considered “cost burdened;” over 50 percent is considered “severely cost burdened.” Almost two-thirds of Los Angeles households rent their homes. In 2022, 57 percent of those Los Angeles renter households were cost burdened, which includes 31 percent that were severely cost burdened. An additional 38 percent of people in owner-occupied units were also cost burdened. With a median household size of 2.58 people, that means approximately 1.86 million people were living in cost burdened households including over a million severely cost burdened. Almost all low-income renter households pay more for housing than they can afford.[128]

In much of west Los Angeles and the northern San Fernando valley, a minority of households rent their homes. The proportion of households that rent is especially high around downtown including the areas east and south of it. Cost burdened households are distributed throughout the city with especially high percentages in the San Fernando Valley (see maps).

In 2020, the city had the second lowest rental vacancy rate in the US and the lowest among major metropolitan areas, reflecting a shortage of homes at the lower priced end of the spectrum.[129] Only about one-half of vacant units are actually for rent or sale, while a growing percentage is held off the market for various reasons, especially an increasing number of short-term rentals. Newer, more expensive units have higher vacancy rates, but are out of reach for low-income renters. Speculative investors, especially in gentrifying areas of the city, often hold housing units vacant to realize increased returns when monetary values rise.

The lack of available affordable homes and the high cost of housing relative to income contribute to severe overcrowding.[133] Families and individuals force themselves into units that are too small for the number of people living in them. About 270,000 households in Los Angeles, almost 14 percent, are considered over-crowded and 80,000 renter households are considered severely overcrowded.[134] No other major city in the US has this level of overcrowding, which places large numbers of people at high risk of falling into houselessness. [135]

E. Death on the Streets

Once a person is living on the streets, the consequences are often dire. After couch surfing, then living in her car, in friends’ garages, occasional hotel rooms, and shelters for over two years, Tanya L. finally obtained a subsidized apartment for herself and her children. She tried to move her mother into the apartment, but the apartment manager said her mother’s status as a parolee was a lease violation. The manager let Tanya remain, but evicted her mother, who had cancer and could not get help from the medical system. She died on the streets.

Houselessness is deadly. Five unsheltered people died each day on average in Los Angeles County in 2020, a 56 percent increase from 2019, following a steady increase from 1.7 per day on average in 2014. The first full year of the Covid-19 pandemic saw that number increase to 5.5 daily deaths on average. In 2021, deaths averaged just over six per day.

Leading causes of death for people living on the streets of Los Angeles County are drug overdoses, especially related to methamphetamine and fentanyl, coronary heart disease, traffic injury, homicide, suicide, and, after March 2020, Covid-19. The average age of death for unhoused people in Los Angeles County is 48 for women and 51 for men.

People who remain unhoused are 80 percent more likely to die than those who regain housing; those who become unhoused after the age of 50 have higher death rates than those who become unhoused at a younger age.

Stressful life situations, lack of access to health care, and exposure to the elements all age people rapidly. Substance use, often to numb the pain of existence on the streets or to help people stay awake to protect themselves, increases the risk of death and contributes to deteriorating health. Death by homicide for unhoused people has increased dramatically in recent years, accounting for 21 percent of all homicides in Los Angeles County in 2021 despite unhoused people making up only about 1 percent of the overall population. Death on the streets is often preventable and almost always brutal.

In September 2021, a woman died in her tent on the sidewalk of 6 Street south of Gladys Avenue. Her neighbors said that she had been suffering through a painful illness for many months. They heard her moaning in her tent, but they were unable to get her medical care. A few days after she died, the Sanitation Department came out and loaded her tent and belongings into their trash compactor truck.

III. Drivers of Houselessness

The government’s failure to dedicate maximum available resources towards realizing the right to housing and its failure to appropriately regulate the profit-driven housing system has led to dramatic shortage of affordable housing causing mass scale houselessness. Other factors like health conditions, discrimination, family violence, and job loss may explain why a particular individual is houseless.

Over half a million low-income renter households lack affordable housing in Los Angeles, while housing development is concentrated in the high end of the market.

Since 2000, renter income in California has gone up by 8 percent, while rents have increased 37 percent; the median two-bedroom unit in Los Angeles was $2,650, about 50 percent of the median income.

Government at all levels has substantially decreased social protection for people living in poverty; Los Angeles County General Relief payments are capped at $221 per month, less than the $312 paid in 1989; the federal government has discontinued direct spending on affordable housing development, while making Section 8 rental assistance available to only about one-quarter of eligible people.

Government policies, including red-lining, zoning, freeway construction, “urban renewal,” and mass incarceration, along with private discrimination and de-industrialization, have enforced racial segregation and contributed to Black poverty and houselessness.

A. Economic structure

The cause of houselessness is, in one sense, extremely simple: the housing system in Los Angeles and throughout the US, does not create or maintain enough affordable, quality housing for all residents.[147] For this reason, a certain number of people necessarily will be unhoused, primarily those who are disadvantaged by the economic system due to discrimination, disability, lack of family or government support, or some other circumstance.[148]

Individuals lose their homes for a broad variety of specific reasons:

Ida J. had to stop working to care for her ailing mother. When her mother died, Ida inherited her debt and could not pay the mortgage. She lost the house and lived on the streets in Skid Row before getting temporary shelter in a motel room. She is in her mid-60s and has sciatica which requires her to use a walker. [149]

Ramon T. worked as a roofer. He, his wife, and two very young children had an apartment that was infested with roaches and barely habitable, and still they could not afford the $1,200 per month rent. The landlord evicted them. His family moved into his wife’s mother’s already crowded apartment, while Ramon set up his tent in MacArthur Park. [150]

Kate W. fled her abusive husband with her children. The domestic violence shelters would not let her stay because her children were too old, so she moved into a large encampment in a riverbed in Ventura County. She got a job and an apartment in Los Angeles, but the pay was not enough for her to cover rent. After her eviction, she continued to work while living in an encampment in the Van Nuys section of Los Angeles. [151]

Carla P. was going to school, but after five years of sobriety she relapsed into drug addiction, leading her to lose her housing. [152]

Sean O. had a temporary job at an Amazon warehouse with no benefits and low pay. After the Christmas season they laid him off. He was arrested for possessing drug paraphernalia and placed on probation. After losing his job, he could not pay fees associated with his probation or his share of the family’s rent. His mother and sister kicked him out of their house, and he ended up living in his truck in Venice.[153]

Many precipitating factors can lead any one person into houselessness, including losing a job, experiencing an eviction, having a mental health condition, family violence, an injury, illness or other medical condition, or a rent increase, for example. People facing these circumstances do not necessarily lose their homes, but the likelihood increases given the overall shortage of affordable housing. For example, 1 in 85 adults with disabilities is unhoused, compared to 1 in 344 adults without disabilities.[154] A substantial share of unhoused people have disabilities, but as these statistics indicate, most people with disabilities do not become houseless. Similarly, most people losing their jobs or facing a health emergency or with substance use disorder do not become houseless, but a certain number do.[155] Most people report that their entry to houselessness began with being removed from their home through an eviction.[156]

Individual factors may explain which individuals become unhoused, but structural features inherent to the market-based approach to housing and enabled by government policies explain the prevalence of houselessness.[157] In the US and especially in Los Angeles, housing is largely treated as a commodity. While people experience their housing as “home,” it also functions, primarily for many people, to build wealth.[158] Homeownership is often as much an investment as it is a place to live; landlords buy properties as a source of income. A market system that treats housing as a commodity does not enable the creation of enough affordable housing for all people without massive government intervention.[159]

Large private equity firms, whose obligation is to their investors, have increasingly bought up housing stock across the US and in Los Angeles.[160] These companies have bought distressed and foreclosed properties, taking advantage of the global financial crisis of the late 2000s to expand their holdings and dominate housing markets.[161] While the industry sometimes claims to be saving affordable housing, former UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Housing Leilani Farha has pointed out that they tend to purchase existing housing and make it more expensive.[162] Specifically, she noted, companies seek out properties that they consider “undervalued” because the rents are not as high as the market will bear.[163] Then they raise rents and cut back maintenance, often driving the existing tenants out, in their efforts to squeeze as much profit as possible from their investments.[164] Private equity firms have bought about 13 percent of homes in the US.[165] In Los Angeles, housing grabs by private corporate landlords have disproportionately impacted Black neighborhoods.

More fundamentally, under a market system in which the goal of real estate development is to build wealth, it is not economically rational for developers large and small to build housing that is affordable to people with low incomes, absent government intervention.[167] Helmi Hisserich, former deputy mayor for housing and homelessness under Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former member of Mayor Richard Riordan’s business team, said that profit-driven developers build high-end housing due, in part, to costs of construction and land.[168]

Building and land costs are especially high in a coastal city like Los Angeles because, among other reasons, land is limited due to geography, suburbanization, and single-family home zoning. Developers are driven to make profit rather than to provide for unhoused or precariously housed people, and the profit margins on high-end homes incentivize developers to build expensive ones. The demand for such homes consumes much of that limited land. Heidi Marston, former executive director of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Agency, explained that non-profit affordable housing developers simply cannot compete for available land on the open market.[171]

The 2023 Los Angeles County Housing Needs Assessment Report found that over half a million low-income renter households do not have access to affordable housing and the average monthly rent requires a person to make almost three times the minimum wage to avoid being rent-burdened.[172] A 2021 study found that Los Angeles had only 20 available affordable rental units for every 100 extremely low-income households.[173] With the bulk of housing production concentrated at the high end of the market, the amount of affordable housing remains well below the needs of the population.[174]

The City of Los Angeles Draft Housing Element 2021-2029 Housing Needs Assessment (2021 LA City Housing Needs Assessment), a study generated every 10 years by the city planning and housing departments, evaluated housing needs and production from 2014 through 2021.[175] To meet estimated needs, the goal for that time period had been 82,002 total units, including 35,412 above moderate income, 13,728 moderate income, and 32,862 low and very low-income units. The total number given permits for development was 103,973—a seeming success. However, 92,407 of those units were for those with above moderate income, 2.6 times greater than the need at that level. Housing development to serve low-income people fell vastly short of the goals.

Projecting forward to the next 10 years, the 2021 LA City Housing Needs Assessment anticipates a massive increase in the need for housing, including 184,721 units for people with low, very low, and extremely low incomes, and another 75,091 for people with moderate incomes.[177] They anticipate new construction will not remotely meet these needs, while overproducing for above moderate-income people by more than 50,000 units.[178] To meet the needs, construction of affordable units will need to increase 2,291 percent by 2029.[179] Such an increase is highly unlikely without substantial government investment.

A 2023 study of housing development across the US found that “multifamily production was extraordinarily strong,” but it mostly targeted the high end of the market. From 2015 through 2022, the share of new units with monthly rents over $2,050 doubled to 36 percent of the market, while the share of units with rent below $1,050 dropped from 22 to 5 percent.

High levels of construction of higher cost housing have not driven costs down and made housing more affordable.[182] Developers leave units empty rather than lower rents or rent them out short-term to individual or corporate tenants.[183]

The area surrounding the encampment near City Hall where Sonja Verdugo first lived is filled with recently built market rate housing with vacancies. The land on which these buildings sit used to be parking lots.

The Downtown section of Los Angeles has relatively high vacancy rates, but also has the highest concentration of people living on its sidewalks.[184] For-profit developers and property owners have built luxury apartments and converted low-income units into above-market rate housing.[185]

Houselessness tracks gentrification.[186] With rising housing costs, relatively middle-income people seek out lower-cost housing in neighborhoods where lower-income people, often Black and Brown people, live. Their ability to pay more pressures the price of that housing upward and reduces the stock available to people who cannot afford as much.[187] Speculative housing developers invest in these neighborhoods with rising home prices to convert previously affordable units into higher-end market rate housing.

Developers have targeted the areas surrounding and even within the neighborhood of Skid Row for creation of upscale, expensive housing, as more wealthy people choose to live in the city core. The Echo Park neighborhood, a traditionally working-class Latino area, has changed drastically over the past two decades, driving up housing costs and displacing longtime residents. David Busch, an unhoused person and advocate who had been living in an encampment there, told of a Latina woman, a grandmother, who had lived in Echo Park her entire life.[188] Unable to afford rent, she lost her house. Not wanting to leave her home and community, she set up a tent in a large encampment by Echo Park Lake. She stayed there until police destroyed that encampment in March 2021 and dispersed its residents.[189]

Gentrification has been ongoing for decades in the Venice neighborhood, as has houselessness. In the mid-2000s, a US Housing and Urban Development subsidized building on the boardwalk that provided affordable homes to dozens of people living on social security disability payments, was converted to a market rate hotel. Units now rent for between $269 and $359 per night.[190] Several of the people displaced by the conversion moved to nearby encampments on the boardwalk or on 3rd Street and some of them have died while living outdoors. Many other residents of these encampments were part of a multi-generational community of working class Black and Latinx people in Venice who had been priced out of their housing. When Google and other technology companies moved to Venice in the early 2010s even more high-income people came to the area, driving housing prices up and accelerating gentrification.[193]

In Los Angeles, the lack of affordable housing and prevalence of poverty create widespread housing instability and houselessness. The 2021 LA City Housing Needs Assessment found the median household income in Los Angeles to be $62,000 per year, well below the cut-off to be considered low-income for a family, and that the most available jobs in the city paid under $30,000 per year.[194] About 22 percent of Los Angeles households live on less than $25,000 per year.[195] People with such low incomes have little flexibility if their rent increases, work hours diminish, or they have an unplanned expense like a health emergency or a traffic accident. Such precarity leaves people on the brink of losing their homes.

Wages in Los Angeles and throughout California have not kept up with housing costs. Since 2000, renter income in California has gone up 8 percent, while rents have increased 37 percent.[196] Los Angeles has among the highest rents of any city in the US. In 2021, the median two-bedroom unit cost $2,650 per month, about 50 percent of the median household income.[197]

Income inequality combines with the sheer numbers of people living in poverty or at its edges to drive houselessness.[198] Los Angeles is home to many very wealthy people and massive numbers of people with little or no wealth. Wages for Californians in the bottom half and bottom tenth of earners have remained stagnant for at least the past 40 years, while wages for the top 5 and 10 percent of earners have risen substantially.[199]

This inequality means some people can afford very expensive housing, thus incentivizing profit-driven developers to build for them and driving the housing market up, while the vast majority of people compete over the insufficient affordable housing stock.[200] With rising housing costs, middle- and even upper-income people seek out less expensive options, making it even more difficult for lower-income people to find homes.[201] A report by the consulting firm McKinsey & Company found that California ranked 49th among US states for housing units per capita and that 50 percent of households could not afford their housing costs.[202] Los Angeles has among the nation’s most severe housing shortages for low-income people.[203] Half a million renter households in Los Angeles cannot afford their homes.[204]

B. Property Values, Housing, and Houselessness

While the commodification of housing--combined with governmental failure to invest in affordable housing--contributes to creating the conditions that lead to houselessness in the US, concern with monetary property values dominates public policy towards housing and unhoused people. “Free market” ideology resists regulations on speculative, profit-driven development of housing and developers and property owners exert their influence over government to promote laws and policies that help them build wealth.

Some scholars observe that the emphasis on home ownership as wealth-building vehicle, promoted by government subsidies and guarantees, along with profit-maximization in the housing rental market, insure that property values, seen strictly in financial terms, guide policy related to houselessness.

Many policymakers and much of the public perceive social or public housing as a “give-away” to undeserving people and as crime-ridden slums. These perceptions are deeply connected to racism. They become self-fulfilling when that perception leads to disinvestment and subsequent deterioration of neighborhoods where poor people live. Many in the public blame those who have “lost the competition” for housing for their own circumstances, viewing them as disposable and subject to banishment from sight.

Government actions—from disinvesting in social supports that meet human needs to removing regulations that would restrain abusive profit-maximizing practices to subsidizing the commodification of the housing stock—have created the conditions in which widespread houselessness exists throughout the US and prominently in Los Angeles. Over the past several decades, the federal government—including under both Republican and Democratic administrations—has drastically cut social protection programs, at the same time that well-paying working class jobs disappeared when the US economy restructured and lost much of its industrial base.

At the local level, for example, state law requires all counties to provide a monthly payment for basic survival to qualified people with no other source of income. These General Relief payments in Los Angeles County were $312 per month in 1989, equivalent to $770 in 2024 dollars. In 2024, the payments were $221 per month, as they have been since 1992 when the California legislature amended the law to allow counties to cap the amount they pay at 62 percent of the 1991 official federal poverty line.[214] In addition to gutting this program by failing to keep up with rising costs of living, the agencies that administer it enforce rules designed to remove people from their rolls to save money.[215] Cutting this and other social protection programs means more people risk falling into houselessness and fewer can escape it.

In place of social supports for people living in poverty and otherwise marginalized people, and instead of making the long-term investments in affordable, non-market housing needed to address the crisis, government policies frequently default to criminalization and removing unhoused people from public view, limiting their perceived potential negative impact monetary property values.

C. Federal housing policy

In response to massive houselessness during the Great Depression of the 1930s, the federal government created the Federal Housing Administration and began funding and building public housing to provide permanently affordable homes for low-income people on a grand scale.[216] Under the public housing model, the federal government paid the full costs of building and maintaining the housing.

In Los Angeles, the Housing Authority (HACLA), which administers public housing, had 8,627 units in 1959, but had only added 305 more units by 1995.[217] Its total stock has steadily dropped since then, leaving HACLA with only 6,488 units of public housing in 2021.[218] There is only one unit of public housing for every 100 people in the city of Los Angeles living in a household with an income below the federal poverty line.

Most of these units were built in the 1950s and have maintenance costs associated with buildings of that age. Public housing funding in Los Angeles, which comes nearly exclusively through federal Public Housing Agency (PHA) grants from HUD, has more than doubled since 2007, without adding new units. Presumably much of this money is spent on maintenance costs for aging buildings. Even with the increase, the federal government still has not adequately funded these costs.[221]

In the 1960s and early 1970s, federal policy shifted away from building and maintaining permanently affordable public housing to subsidizing building by private developers.[222] About 50 percent of the US federally assisted affordable housing stock is owned by for-profit entities.[223]

Programs created by the 1961 National Housing Act and the 1968 Housing and Urban Development Act, referred to as the Section 236 and 221(d)(3) programs, for example, offered private developers extremely low interest rates on mortgages, and guaranteed return on their investment, in exchange for them keeping the units they developed affordable for a set time period—usually 40 years. They also gave developers the right to pay off their mortgages after 20 years. Once the developer paid off the mortgage, either after 40 years or as early as 20 years, they could charge market rates for rents.[225] Hundreds of thousands of units of housing built under these and other programs across the US have been or soon may be removed from the stock of affordable housing.[226] As the federal government has long ago discontinued these programs, they are not replacing the lost housing stock.

In Los Angeles, affordability restrictions for 9,412 units of housing financed with federal and state subsidies are scheduled to expire by 2031 and an additional 47,286 will end after that date.[227] Private owners in expensive housing markets like Los Angeles have great incentive to shed affordability restrictions.[228]

In the historically Black and working class, but now heavily gentrified, Oakwood neighborhood in Venice, for example, 190 units in 10 buildings of the Holiday Venice development have subsidies and affordability restrictions expiring in 2029.[229] These buildings were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s by Black community members using Section 236 subsidies, but they have since fallen into private ownership. They are home to many of the last remaining Black and Latinx families in Venice, who have organized effectively over the years to maintain the affordability restrictions on these buildings.[230]

In the 1970s, housing policy shifted further away from new construction towards programs subsidizing rents. The “Section 8” programs allow low-income tenants to pay only 30 percent of their income as rent, with a subsidy going directly to a private landlord who charges an approved “market” rent.[231] Two basic categories of Section 8 subsidies continue to exist today.[232]

Project-based Section 8 is a subsidy attached to a building that allows the landlord/developer to pay operating costs through rents covered by the subsidy.[233] Project-based Section 8 subsidies are used to help finance housing developed by housing authorities and private developers.[234] Like other government subsidies to private housing developers, project-based Section 8 is time limited, allowing these developers to “opt-out” of their contracts and obligations to rent to lower-income people after a certain time-period.[235]

The second type of Section 8 program provides a qualified person with a voucher that they can take to a private landlord guaranteeing that they will pay 30 percent of their income for rent and the housing authority will cover the difference between that 30 percent and a determined “market rate.” While vouchers help reduce the amount people have to pay for rent, the money goes to the property owner, and the program does not expand the stock of housing.[236] Section 8 vouchers give people more choice about where to live, so long as landlords will accept them.[237] Voucher availability is limited by lack of funding and millions of eligible people across the US cannot get them.

By the 1980s, the federal government had almost entirely cut off direct funding for new housing development, instead focusing on Section 8 subsidies and further privatizing affordable housing production.[239] As part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, it created the Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program (LIHTC).[240] Under LIHTC, which remains the primary federal funding source for affordable housing today, the government gives investors tax credits to incentivize development of low-income housing.[241]

LIHTC housing now accounts for almost half of all federally assisted affordable units.[242] However, without additional Section 8 subsidies, LIHTC housing is not necessarily affordable for the lowest income people most at-risk of homelessness.[243] Affordability requirements generally last 30 years; investors may be able to opt-out of them after 15.[244] This expiration can cause instability for tenants in tight housing markets like Los Angeles.[245] By 2029, affordability requirements for several hundred thousand units of housing funded by LIHTC across the US are scheduled to expire.[246] California gave developers incentives to accept longer affordability restrictions, and, in 1996, California required future LIHTC projects to remain affordable for a minimum of 55 years.

In addition to moving away from directly funding and building affordable housing, the federal government has drastically reduced its overall spending on housing.[248] Reduced funding has hampered efforts to maintain existing housing, leading to deterioration of the affordable housing stock, which may impact availability across the country and funding for new units.[249] Further, the system by which non-profit housing developers finance affordable housing developments using tax credits and multiple other sources of funding, including from private sources and from different levels of government, has become highly complicated, expensive, and inefficient, contributing greatly to the failure to meet the need.[250]

Since the 1980s, the federal government has passed various housing initiatives, but never funded them adequately.[251] The 1990 National Affordable Housing Act purported to help preserve housing with expiring subsidies primarily through block grants to local jurisdictions.[252] This program has not been funded to meet the need and has seen major cuts in recent years.[253] Also in the 1990s, the HOPE VI program led to the demolition of tens of thousands of “severely distressed” public housing units, only some of which were replaced by affordable units for low-income people, causing further displacement.[254] The National Housing Trust Fund (NHTF), part of the 2008 Housing and Economic Recovery Act, aimed to develop 1.5 million units of affordable housing.[255] However, Congress did not begin funding the program until 2016.[256] It paid for development of 739 units that year and the preservation of several hundred others.[257] There are currently bills proposed in Congress to fund housing development and preservation.[258] US President Joe Biden’s “Build Back Better” legislation proposed large sums of money for affordable housing, but Congress did not pass it.[259]

Beginning in the 1980s, federal homelessness policy emphasized sheltering unhoused people instead of creating the housing they needed.[260] The 1987 McKinney Homeless Assistance Act created and funded programs to provide shelter, transitional housing, and services for unhoused people, but very little permanent housing.[261] Similarly, the “Continuum of Care” model, developed by HUD in the 1980s, emphasized programming ahead of housing.[262]

In the early 2000s, the federal government adopted a nominal “Housing First” policy to address houselessness.[263] Housing First means placing people in stable, secure housing first, then taking steps to address other needs, such as voluntary mental health services, or treatment for problematic substance use.[264] State and local governments, including California and Los Angeles, claim to adhere to the Housing First model. However, few jurisdictions have dedicated sufficient resources to implement a true version of Housing First.[265]

The 2009 federal Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing Act (HEARTH) program continued the pattern of funding shelter, transitional housing, and services without putting enough resources into permanent housing.[266] Former US President Donald Trump’s administration explicitly rejected the Housing First approach, instead focusing on removing regulatory barriers to private housing development and supporting law enforcement responses.[267]

Meanwhile, even as the federal government has dramatically reduced funding for affordable housing that would help people living in poverty over the years, it has supported those who could afford to buy a home by allowing them to deduct mortgage interest payments from their taxable income. This tax deduction amounts to a $70 billion yearly subsidy to middle- and upper-income people.[268]

D. State and Local Policies in California and Los Angeles

At the state and local level, investment in affordable housing and in prevention of houselessness has been sporadic, though recent years have seen renewed emphasis in Los Angeles and California. Los Angeles voters, for example, passed Proposition HHH, a $1.2 billion bond to finance affordable housing, in 2016, and Measure ULA, a tax on high-end real estate transaction to pay for affordable housing and eviction prevention, in 2023. The state of California has been investing in a variety of programs to develop more housing. However, structural and philosophical barriers remain.

The laws that govern the landlord-tenant relationship generally allow landlords to do what they want with the property. Los Angeles’ Rent Stabilization Ordinance (LARSO), which regulates some rentals in the city, provides limited eviction controls but landlords can get around them by doing some remodeling of their units or taking the units off the rental market.[271] In January 2023, the City Council passed tenant protections that also apply to rental units not covered by LARSO, including a requirement that landlords have “just cause” for evictions and prohibiting eviction for non-payment of rent unless the amount owed exceeds one month’s fair market rent. Other tenant protections, like guaranteed representation in eviction proceedings, are not available.

According to media reports, many for-profit developers and major landlords have made significant efforts to influence Los Angeles City Council members.[273] They have invested huge sums of money into lobbying efforts. They have contributed to city council campaigns and organized to defeat council members who have favored renters’ rights. Several city council members and their staff have been indicted and convicted in recent years for corruption involving alleged payments from real estate developers.[276]

In 2018, changes in state law allowed the city to enforce long-dormant “inclusionary zoning” laws that require new developments in some areas to include affordable units, but they have not been in effect long enough to have major impact.[277]

The Ellis Act, a state law which allows landlords to evict tenants in rent controlled or rent stabilized units and convert those units to high-priced housing, has led to the removal of nearly 30,000 homes with tenant protections from the Los Angeles rental market since 2001.[278]

While not investing sufficiently in measures that will reduce houselessness and promoting market-based laws and policies that encourage the commodification of housing, federal, state, and especially local governments continue to invest heavily in criminalization.

E. Houselessness in Los Angeles is a Manifestation of White Supremacy

The high rate of houselessness among Black residents of Los Angeles is the result of decades of laws, policies, and practices that discriminate against Black people and other people of color.[279] It is the result of a commodified housing market that devalues Black lives. It is the result of systemic racism that pervades policing, education, health care, employment, and other systems and disadvantages Black people in the competition for scarce housing resources. Much of the houselessness in Los Angeles, and much of the rest of the country, is a manifestation of white supremacy.[280]

Racist policies and practices leading to modern houselessness date back centuries.[281] The land on which Los Angeles now sits is home to the Tongva people, but it was taken from them by Spanish colonial settlers and Catholic priests who enslaved and forcibly converted some, killed most, and banished others.[282] In 1850, California passed a law punishing “Indians” found to be loitering by forcing them to perfo",HIGH,20240814T090000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Karen Bass, city officials, LAPD, LASAN officials, unhoused individuals",Los Angeles City and County Government,"Los Angeles, California","Increase investment in permanent housing solutions, repeal laws that criminalize unhoused individuals, enhance social support systems",Failure to provide adequate permanent housing and criminalization of unhoused individuals,United States,"Lack of affordable housing, racial discrimination, socioeconomic factors"

(Beirut) – Iraq’s parliament is moving forward an amendment to the country’s Personal Status Law that would allow Iraqi religious authorities, rather than state law, to govern marriage and inheritance matters at the expense of fundamental rights, Human Rights Watch said today. The Iraqi parliament, which completed its first reading of the bill on August 4, 2024, will have two more readings of the bill and a debate before deciding whether to vote it into law.

If passed, the amendment would have disastrous effects on women’s and girls’ rights guaranteed under international law by allowing marriage for girls as young as 9, undermining the principle of equality under Iraqi law, and removing protections for women regarding divorce and inheritance. Child marriage puts girls at increased risk of sexual and physical violence, adverse physical and mental health consequences, and being denied access to education and employment.

“The Iraqi parliament’s passage of this bill would be a devastating step backward for Iraqi women and girls and the rights they have fought hard to enshrine in law,” said Sarah Sanbar, Iraq researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Formally legalizing child marriage would rob countless girls of their futures and well-being. Girls belong in school and on the playground, not in a wedding dress.”

The draft amendment would legalize, rather than try to reverse, Iraq’s significant and growing child marriage problem, Human Rights Watch said.

Iraqi rights groups and activists have taken to the streets to protest the amendment, and a group of more than 15 women parliament members from diverse parties have come together to oppose its passage. Parliament proposed similar amendments to the Personal Status Law in 2014 and again in 2017, both of which failed to pass.

Under the draft amendment, couples concluding a marriage contract could choose whether the provisions of the Personal Status Law or the provisions of specific Islamic schools of jurisprudence would apply. If couples are from different sects, the school followed by the husband’s sect would apply.

This arrangement would effectively establish separate legal regimes with different rights accorded to different sects. It would further enshrine sectarianism in Iraq, undermining the right to legal equality for all Iraqis found in article 14 of the constitution and international human rights law.

For instance, the Jaafari school of law, which many Shia Muslims in Iraq follow, allows for girls as young as 9 and boys as young as 15 to be married. The Personal Status Law sets the legal age for marriage at 18, or 15 with a judge’s permission and depending on the child’s “maturity and physical capacity,” which already contravenes international legal standards and best practices.

The draft amendment would also authenticate unregistered marriages, which are conducted by religious leaders but not registered with personal status courts and are illegal under the current Personal Status Law. The amendment would also remove criminal punishments for men entering into these marriages and allow religious leaders, rather than the courts, to finalize marriages.

Unregistered marriages are already a loophole enabling child marriage in Iraq, where child marriage rates have been rising over the last 20 years, a March 2024 report by Human Rights Watch found. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) reported that 28 percent of girls in Iraq are married before age 18. According to the UN Assistance Mission in Iraq, 22 percent of unregistered marriages involved girls under age 14.

Unregistered marriages also have extremely harmful effects on women and girls’ ability to obtain government services, register their children’s birth, and claim their rights, Human Rights Watch said. Without a civil marriage certificate, women and girls are unable to give birth in hospitals, itself an unjust obstruction to health care, and are forced to give birth at home with limited access to emergency obstetric services. This increases the risk of medical complications that threaten the life of both the mother and her baby. Children and young women are especially vulnerable to some pregnancy complications.

The amendment would also remove and undermine protections for divorced women. Under the existing Personal Status Law, if a husband requests a divorce, the wife has the right to remain in their marital home for three years at the husband’s expense and to receive two years of spousal maintenance and the current value of her dowry. If a wife requests a divorce, a judge can award her some of these benefits depending on the circumstances.

If religious law were applied, women would lose many of these protections. For example, under the Jaafari school of law, a woman who gets divorced has no right to the marital home, maintenance, or her dowry, and children would continue living with her for only two years, regardless of their age, contingent on her not remarrying.

Women would also lose some inheritance rights. Even under existing law, daughters inherit a lower proportion of a parent’s wealth than sons. But under some religious laws, daughters would inherit even less, and if a family has no son to inherit the agricultural land, it would revert to the state.

Finally, the amendment stipulates that the Scholar Council of the Shia Endowment Office and the Fatwa Council of the Sunni Endowment Office will develop a “code of Sharia [Islamic law] rulings on personal status matters” and submit it to the house of representatives within six months from the date of entry into force of the law.

This would mean lawmakers and the general public would not have a chance to review or vote on the code before it becomes law, removing democratic oversight and granting disproportionate power to religious authorities in setting the law, Human Rights Watch said.

The proposed amendment was introduced by Raad al-Maliki, an independent member of parliament who also introduced the amendment to Iraq’s Law on Combatting Prostitution that criminalized same-sex relations, gender-affirming medical interventions, and “promoting homosexuality,” which passed in April 2024.The law violates fundamental human rights, including the rights to freedom of expression, association, privacy, equality, and nondiscrimination of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in Iraq.

The proposed amendment would violate the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which Iraq ratified in 1986, by depriving women and girls of their rights on the basis of their gender. The amendment also violates the Convention on Rights of the Child, which Iraq ratified in 1994, by legalizing child marriage, putting girls at risk of forced and early marriage, leaving them susceptible to sexual abuse, and not requiring decisions about children in divorce cases to be made in the best interests of the child.

It is extremely rare for countries to walk away from longstanding commitments under International Humanitarian Law (IHL), but Lithuania has become the first State Party to vote to leave the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions.

In doing so Lithuania is staining its otherwise excellent reputation on these weapons and on disarmament more generally. It is also ignoring abundant evidence demonstrating the foreseeable risk of civilian harm from these often indiscriminate weapons, which leave large areas of land unusable for decades.

Delivered from aircraft or fired in rockets, missiles, and artillery projectiles, cluster munitions open in the air to disperse multiple submunitions over a wide area. Many submunitions fail to detonate as designed and pose a long-lasting danger, like landmines.

These weapons have been prohibited by a majority of the world’s nations because, when used in populated areas, they predominantly harm civilians both at the time of use and for years afterward. According to Cluster Munition Monitor, a nonprofit organization which tracks “adherence to and compliance” with the Convention, at least 95 percent of those killed or wounded by cluster munitions in 2022, in which the victim’s status was recorded, were civilians, and children accounted for 71 percent of casualties from cluster munition remnants.

The Convention on Cluster Munitions comprehensively bans any use, production, stockpiling, and transfer of these weapons under any circumstances. Since the convention entered into force on Aug. 1, 2010, the 112 countries that have ratified it have abided by the core provisions; none have engaged in prohibited activities like transferring or using the weapons.

The Convention is also a lifesaving instrument as it requires the destruction of stockpiles, clearance of cluster munition remnants, and assistance to survivors of the weapons.

On July 18, Lithuania’s parliament adopted a legislative proposal to leave the Convention. The law entered into force on July 26, one day after it was signed by President Gitanas Nausėda.

This decision came as a surprise, particularly because Lithuania has never produced, stockpiled, transferred, or used cluster munitions. It has actively participated in the Convention’s meetings and has repeatedly expressed concern at the use of cluster munitions by countries such as Russia and Syria.

However, over the past year Lithuanian defense officials have made the case for the country to leave the Convention, asserting that cluster munitions are a necessary weapon due to changes in the national security situation, especially since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Human Rights Watch (where I work), the United Nations, and others have documented that repeated Russian cluster munitions attacks have killed and injured hundreds of Ukrainian civilians since 2022. Ukrainian forces have also used cluster munitions, resulting in civilian casualties.

At the Eleventh Meeting of States Parties to the Convention on Cluster Munition in September 2023, member countries including Lithuania condemned “any use of cluster munitions by any actor.” They expressed “grave concern at the significant increase in civilian casualties and the humanitarian impact resulting from the repeated and well documented use of cluster munitions” since 2021, particularly with respect to “the use of cluster munitions in Ukraine.”

Lithuania’s withdrawal will take effect six months after the documents are submitted to the United Nations and the convention’s States Parties as long as Lithuania is not engaged in armed conflict at that time. Article 20 of the Convention explicitly prevents a State Party that is engaged in armed conflict from withdrawing before the end of the conflict.

During the parliamentary debate, Defense Minister, Laurynas Kasčiūnas, said that “when we ratified this convention [in 2011] it was a different era. Now everything is much more complicated. Therefore, it would be very wrong if the state, while preparing for its defense, would immediately say what capacity it would not use for its defense.”

Similarly, Lithuania’s Deputy Minister of Defense, Renius Plečkis, told parliament that “the move to denounce the Convention is motivated by the need to make the most of all opportunities to strengthen our deterrence and defense.”

Yet IHL is not designed for when national security circumstances are considered secure, but rather for outright armed conflict. As the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Mirjana Spoljaric, notes, IHL “is not made for the hopeful days of peacetime. It is made for humanity’s darkest days, when armed conflict rages and people are in grave danger.”

Norway’s foreign affairs minister, Espen Barth Eide, has called Lithuania’s proposed withdrawal from the convention “regrettable.” He said, “it is vital that states uphold their obligations” when it comes to the ban on cluster munitions and “maintain international rules, norms and obligations for warfare, also when the security landscape changes.”

Plečkis told parliament that Lithuania is interested in acquiring cluster munitions. He said that Lithuania’s main defense partner, the United States, “will probably help us” in this regard.

Since July 2023, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has approved five transfers to Ukraine of U.S. cluster munitions delivered by 155mm artillery projectiles and by ballistic missiles. A new report shows that cluster munitions held at a U.S. base in Germany have been transferred to Ukraine as part of U.S. military assistance, transiting across Germany and Poland in the process.

Russia, Ukraine, and the United States have not joined the Convention on Cluster Munitions. Regardless, the use of cluster munitions in areas with civilians present often makes an attack indiscriminate in violation of IHL, and possibly a war crime. The use of cluster munitions runs contrary to the emerging international norm stigmatizing these weapons.

No State has ever withdrawn from any of the five multilateral treaties that comprehensively prohibit an entire class of weapons and that were driven by humanitarian concerns (the Convention on Cluster Munitions, the Mine Ban Treaty, the Biological Weapons Convention, the Chemical Weapons Convention, and the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons). The danger now is that Lithuania could move to withdraw from these humanitarian disarmament standard bearers. And that others will follow its terrible precedent.

As President of the convention’s 12th Meeting of States Parties, which opens at the United Nations in Geneva on Sept. 10, Mexico has strongly discouraged Lithuania from withdrawing. Mexico instead recommends using “multilateralism, humanitarian ethos and respect for the rule of law” as “key values to guide us forward” in the wake of the decision.

All Parties to the Convention need to publicly and vocally reaffirm the value and importance of this instrument. Silence sends a bleak message to other countries that might be considering leaving. They should do their utmost to discourage any actions by States that would undermine or weaken it.

(London) – Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned on August 5, 2024, and fled the country after weeks of student protests, Human Rights Watch said today. An estimated 300 people have been killed, thousands injured, and more than 10,000 arrested.

The army chief general, Waker-Uz-Zaman, said, “I promise you all, we will bring justice” while announcing the prime minister’s resignation and confirming that an interim government would be formed. The authorities should prioritize implementing a transparent and independent justice mechanism and immediately release all political prisoners, including those being held in incommunicado detention. The interim government should accept the United Nations’ support to open an independent inquiry into grave abuses both during the recent student protests and earlier, during the years of Sheikh Hasina’s government.

“Sheikh Hasina’s resignation after nearly 15 years of increasing authoritarianism brings new hope for accountability and democratic reform to Bangladesh,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The interim government should seize this opportunity to reorient the country toward the rule of law with independent institutions to assure justice for the victims.”

The prime minister’s resignation was the culmination of student protests that began in early July. The protesters initially were responding to the reinstatement of a 30 percent job quota for descendants of 1971 independence war veterans, which they described as a form of political patronage for ruling party supporters. Though the protests began peacefully, violence broke out on July 15, when security forces and members of the Chhatra League, the governing Awami League’s student group, attacked the protesters.

In response, students took to the streets. They had widespread support from Bangladeshis, who said they were not only appalled by the attack on students but also expressed anger over corruption, unfair elections, and rampant abuses by security forces. The government deployed the army and shut down internet access, during which activists reported extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances. The authorities carried out a cordon and search operation, arresting more than 10,000 suspected protesters and lodging cases against tens of thousands more.

After the government lifted the curfew and partially restored the internet, the students called for civil disobedience to protest human rights violations, including killings, arbitrary arrests, and torture by Bangladeshi security forces. On August 4, tens of thousands joined the protests, calling on Sheikh Hasina and her ministers to resign.

Sheikh Hasina responded by reportedly calling on her supporters “to curb anarchists with iron hands.” There were deadly clashes between ruling party supporters and protesters across the country. The military took over on August 5, with the army chief announcing Sheikh Hasina’s resignation.

On August 5, Maayer Daak, an advocacy group of families of victims of enforced disappearance, held a demonstration outside of the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence headquarters, Bangladesh’s military intelligence agency. The agency allegedly ran a secret prison there, where victims of enforced disappearance were held and tortured. The authorities should offer the families of enforced disappearance some relief by releasing all those currently held in incommunicado detention, independently investigating every case in which victims’ whereabouts remain unknown, and holding those responsible to account.

In a positive move, Mir Ahmad Bin Quasem and Abdullahil Amaan Azmi, both victims of enforced disappearance, were released by the authorities on August 5. Bin Quasem was arrested at his house late on August 9, 2016, in the presence of his wife and sister. Security forces denied his arrest and repeatedly threatened and harassed his family. Azmi, a retired army officer, was detained on August 22, 2016, by men in civilian clothes who said they were from the police Detective Branch, but the authorities later denied his arrest. Both men are sons of party leaders of the opposition Jamaat-e-Islami, who were convicted of committing war crimes during Bangladesh’s struggle for independence.

Enforced disappearances skyrocketed under Sheikh Hasina’s rule and became a hallmark of her repression. In her first year in office this term in 2009, there were three reported enforced disappearances. By the next election in 2014, there had been 131. According to Bangladesh human rights groups, over 600 people have been forcibly disappeared by security forces since Sheikh Hasina took office.

The former prime minister’s rule was characterized by a culture of impunity alongside grave security force abuses, including extrajudicial killings, torture, and enforced disappearances. Those who dared to speak out risked their lives. Sheikh Hasina’s government further stifled free expression through a series of vague and overly broad laws used to harass and indefinitely detain activists, journalists, and others critical of the government.

The military has previously taken over, most recently in 2007 as a caretaker government. Though the military-led interim government was initially broadly welcomed, this soon gave way to widespread security force abuses. Under the declared state of emergency, the military tortured critics, limited political participation, and clamped down on freedom of expression and association.

The UN has called for calm and a peaceful transition. Soon after Sheikh Hasina resigned, some Bangladeshis engaged in vandalism, attacking religious minorities as well as Awami League members and their properties. Student leaders and opposition leaders called for calm, and activists gathered to protect minority Hindu religious sites. Bangladeshi authorities should be vigilant and prevent violent retaliation against Sheikh Hasina’s supporters or any other lawlessness, Human Rights Watch said.

“Bangladeshis have protested, and many have died, to protect human rights and democracy,” Ganguly said. “It is crucial for influential governments to help ensure that the country’s future is not sacrificed by repeating the past.”",HIGH,20240806T191500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Sheikh Hasina, Waker-Uz-Zaman, Meenakshi Ganguly",Sheikh Hasina's government,Bangladesh,Implement transparent justice mechanisms and release political prisoners.,Authoritarianism and human rights abuses including extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances,Bangladesh,"Political patronage, corruption, authoritarian governance"

Everything I saw at Koro Toro was terrible. My family was abandoned. I was pardoned, but for what? What did I do wrong?

– Former detainee at Koro Toro, N’Djamena, May 9, 2023

Even now I don’t sleep. I am traumatized by what happened to me. I couldn’t breathe in the Sarkozy [truck] … I am haunted by it.

– Former detainee at Koro Toro, N’Djamena, May 8, 2023

On October 20, 2022, thousands of people took to the streets of N’Djamena, the capital of Chad, and several other towns in the country’s south, to protest an extension of the transitional government by two years. Since former President Idriss Déby Itno died in April 2021, the transitional government headed by his son, Gen. Mahamat Idriss Déby, has on several occasions violently suppressed protests demanding civilian democratic rule. The police, the army, and gendarmes have targeted opposition parties during protests, but the violence used against protestors on October 20, 2022, was more severe than what had been seen before.

Security forces fired live ammunition at protesters, killing and injuring scores, beat people, chased them into homes, and detained them. Relatives, witnesses, and former detainees said that those detained were held in police stations, and in at least one school in Abena, N’Djamena, for several days. In some cases, the protesters were severely beaten in detention by soldiers, police, or gendarmes. Hundreds of protesters, including at least one girl, were then taken to Koro Toro, a high security prison managed by the government and located about 600 kilometers from N’Djamena, in Central Chad. Koro Toro, which was designed to house “violent extremists,” is cut off from the outside world with no cell phone reception and hundreds of kilometers from major urban centers. Given its remote location, family members and lawyers said it is practically impossible to visit the prison.

This report, based on research conducted between November 2022 and July 2023 in N’Djamena, documents human rights violations associated with the transit of detained protesters to Koro Toro and at Koro Toro prison itself. On October 21 and 22, security forces crammed detainees to be transported to the prison into open air trucks at a military base – called Camp 27 – in N’Djamena. Most detainees had been previously held in police stations before being taken to Camp 27. Former detainees said it was very difficult to even turn around or stretch in the trucks, which security forces then escorted to Koro Toro. En route to the prison, most were denied food and water over two to three days, making some of the detainees delirious, with some having to drink their own urine and that of other detainees. Some detainees died, presumably from delirium and hunger.

Human Rights Watch documented the deaths of at least four people en route to Koro Toro, six others at Koro Toro, and of one man who died either en route or at Koro Toro, although the real number of dead is likely much higher. Relatives were not officially informed of the death of their loved ones. Some were told informally. The remains of those who arrived at Koro Toro dead – or of those who died in the prison – have not been released to their families.

Koro Toro is comprised principally of two prisons, known as Koro Toro 1 and Koro Toro 2, or Koro Toro Habré and Koro Toro Déby – named respectively after former Presidents Hissène Habré and Idris Déby Itno, under whose rule the prison blocks were constructed – located about one kilometer apart from each other. Koro Toro 1 – Koro Toro Habré – is older than Koro Toro 2 and is in decrepit conditions. The prisons hold suspects who have yet to be charged with a crime, pre-trial detainees, and convicted prisoners.

At Koro Toro, detainees accused of participating in the October 20, 2022 protests were held in violation of the law, denied due process, and subjected to very limited judicial oversight. They were also exposed to serious human rights violations, including inhuman and degrading treatment.

Koro Toro is administered by the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, while security is managed by the army, the Garde nationale et nomade du Tchad (The National and Nomad Guard of Chad), known by its acronym GNNT.

Human Rights Watch used geographic features seen in images obtained and verified, and matched these with satellite imagery to geolocate the site of Koro Toro. It then used this material, along with sketches provided by victims, to construct diagrammatic models of the site of the prison, showing cells, areas of solitary confinement, cells in which Boko Haram members were held, and military buildings at the complex.

Former detainees described that, while Koro Toro was guarded by soldiers from the national army, day-to-administration of the prison was managed by prisoners suspected of having links to the Islamist armed group Boko Haram. These prisoners have the most influence in Koro Toro 1, where they punished and beat up other detainees, oversaw food distribution, and ran a small market. Former detainees said that the soldiers gave these prisoners de facto authority to ill-treat and beat others.

Several former detainees were held in isolation cells, called “soulou,” often after minor missteps such as missing a roll call or returning late to their cells. In some instances, other detainees – allegedly those convicted of or awaiting trial for links to Boko Haram – would decide who would be housed in isolation cells. In other instances, detainees were put into these cells by prison officials. Human Rights Watch confirmed at least one case of a detainee who died while in an isolation cell in 2022.

Shackles were routinely used on detainees, perhaps to prevent escapes, as many of the cells at Koro Toro 1 are dilapidated and several are without doors. At least 10 former detainees described how they were shackled with iron bars around their ankles for periods ranging from days to weeks, making it very difficult to walk, change clothes, or use toilets. However, all former detainees interviewed said that hundreds of men or boys were shackled when they were detained at Koro Toro.

Some detainees said they were forced to make bricks that were sold by security forces for profit, which constitutes forced labor. Most former detainees said the prison authorities gave them very limited access to food, water, hygiene, or medical services. None were allowed to contact their families or lawyers, nor had access to legal services. Being cut off from families and lawyers was identified as a key problem by many detainees.

Children as young as 13 years old brought to Koro Toro were held in the same cells and rooms as adults for at least the first 2 weeks of detention.

During the first two weeks, detainees slept on the bare floor until mattresses were provided by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Medical treatment was only available at Koro Toro 2. At Koro Toro 1, health care was sporadic and provided by a prisoner, who was referred to as a nurse and said to be accused of being a Boko Haram fighter from Cameroon. Former detainees said that the little medical care provided at Koro Toro 1 and 2 failed to address their needs. One HIV-positive former detainee told Human Rights Watch of a continuing lack of treatment even after he had explained to the officials he was HIV-positive. He was given treatment by the ICRC two weeks into his detention. Human Rights Watch documented at least six cases of detainees who did not receive any medical care, including for injuries sustained from beatings and en route to the detention facility, and then died while at Koro Toro.

A law providing a general amnesty, passed by the transitional government on November 23, 2023, currently blocks prosecutions of security forces implicated in the violent repression of the October 20, 2022 demonstrations. The government, however, is responsible for ensuring accountability for the abuse that happened to those in detention and en route to the detention facility following the protests.

The lawful basis for depriving the October 20 protestors of their liberty is shaky, and the judicial process regulating their detention was sporadic and arbitrary.

By early December 2022, 401 people who had allegedly been caught in the act (“flagrant délit,” according to Chadian criminal law) had been put on trial for a range of charges, including unauthorized gathering, destroying property, arson, and disturbing public order. Over the course of the next several months, an additional 150 and 200 others were put on trials for similar charges.

Judicial proceedings were run by the Tribunal of N’Djamena, which was operating from Koro Toro for the hearings. Based on interviews with former detainees, the interrogations and judicial proceedings were hurried and denied the accused their right to a fair trial. In many instances, the investigating officer or judge was only interested in which neighborhood the defendants came from. Those from neighborhoods believed to be sympathetic to the political opposition were allegedly questioned more specifically about their political allegiance.

During trials, a variety of weapons were presented to defendants as evidence against them and they were told to confess. Each former detainee interviewed by Human Rights Watch said he was put on trial with many other men, usually between 20 to 30 at a time, and that they were then given the same sentences and penalties as a group. The trials, that only lasted a few minutes, were summary in nature. Some accused raised the issue of unlawful detention and abuse suffered both in transit to Koro Toro and at Koro Toro prison in court, but the judges paid no heed to the complaints.

Chadian authorities are obliged under international human rights law to provide detainees with the same health care available to people who are at liberty and, under international standards, pretrial detention should only be used as a last resort.

Article 22 of Chad’s 2023 constitution forbids illegal arrests and arbitrary detention. Article 19 forbids degrading and inhuman abuse or treatment as well as torture. Article 25 sets out the presumption of innocence and provides guarantees for the defense of the accused.

Chad’s Criminal Code, revised in 2017, defines torture in accordance with the 1984 Convention against Torture, and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. According to article 176 of the Code, a law enforcement official who, “without justification, uses violence against one or more persons in the exercise of his or her duties will be punished with a term of imprisonment of between six months and five years.”

The Chadian government maintains that the protests on October 20 amounted to an insurrection and that, given the seriousness of this crime, detention at Koro Toro was not extreme. Over one year on, those connected to the protests who were detained at Koro Toro have been pardoned and most have been freed and transferred back to N’Djamena. In a July 2023 letter to Human Rights Watch, reproduced in Annex II of this report, Chad’s minister of justice noted that there existed “no evidence relating to the violation of human rights related to [the] transfer or detention in Koro-Toro prison.”

Human Rights Watch calls on the Chadian government to immediately close Koro Toro 1 on the basis that it is unfit for holding detainees as it lacks even the most basic standards of care. Koro Toro 2 should undergo repairs to make it adequate for holding prisoners, including installing a means for detainees to communicate with their families and legal services. No one should be held at Koro Toro without charges, and anyone currently so held should be released immediately. In accordance with international law, pretrial detention should only be used in exceptional circumstances, as provided for in Chadian law. Pretrial detainees should not be held together with convicted prisoners, and their detention should not prevent them from being able to prepare an effective defense. Accordingly, those currently remanded by a court to pretrial detention should not be held in Koro Toro but transferred to a more accessible detention facility, where they can receive a prompt trial.

Chadian authorities should also secure the return to their families of the remains of the October 20 protestors who died either in transit to Koro Toro or at Koro Toro so they can be buried with dignity.

In the cases documented in this report, the security forces who detained protesters were from the Chadian national police, gendarmerie, and the army and detainees were transported to Koro Toro prison by soldiers. Human Rights Watch calls on the Chadian national police, gendarmes, and the army to investigate all cases of ill-treatment associated with the transfer to and detention at Koro Toro prison such as those described in this report, suspend those responsible for these abuses, and ensure they are brought to justice.

The UN special rapporteurs on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, and on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (African Commission, or ACHPR) special rapporteur on prisons, conditions of detention and policing should visit Chad to examine cases of torture, ill-treatment, and deaths in custody, including the ones outlined in this report.

The UN and the African Union, including the above-mentioned special rapporteurs, should provide technical and other assistance to support a Chadian investigation, or conduct their own investigations if the Chadian authorities fail to act.

This report is based on research carried out by Human Rights Watch in N’Djamena, Chad’s capital, during research trips in November 2022 and April, May, and June 2023. Telephone interviews were conducted from November 2022 through January 2024.

Human Rights Watch interviewed over 150 people for this report, including 71 adult former detainees and one 13-year-old boy who had been held at Koro Toro after the October 22, 2022 protests. Names and other identifying information have been withheld to protect privacy and security.

Human Rights Watch conducted most interviews in French. In some instances, interviews were conducted in Ngambay, a language spoken in Southern Chad, with an interpreter. Former detainees were interviewed individually and privately. Human Rights Watch staff explained to each interviewee the purpose of the interview, its voluntary nature, the way in which the information would be used, and the fact that no compensation would be provided.

Some prisoners were able to give Human Rights Watch photos from Koro Toro stored on memory cards.

In June 2023, Human Rights Watch wrote to then-transitional president and now current president, the prime minister, the minister of justice, the minister of public security, the minister of defense, and the head of the national police requesting meetings to discuss its research findings on Koro Toro. Human Rights Watch met with the prime minister on two occasions and once with the minister of public security. Human Rights Watch shared a summary of its research with the government on June 29, 2023 (see Annex I of this report). The minister of justice responded to Human Rights Watch’s concerns in writing, in a letter dated July 6, 2023 (see Annex II of this report).

This report focuses specifically on human rights violations committed during transport to and at Koro Toro prison. Human Rights Watch has heard of other abuses in several other detention centers in Chad, but this report does not cover those locations. Human Rights Watch documented human rights abuse perpetrated as part of the crackdown against protestors in other publications.



Background

Increased Repression

Government security forces intensified their crackdown on protesters and the political opposition in the lead-up to the country’s April 11, 2021 presidential election, in which then-incumbent President Idriss Déby Itno, who had been ruling Chad since December 1990, when he removed the autocratic leader Hissène Habré, ran for a sixth term.

From February to April 2021, a coalition of nongovernmental groups, labor unions, and opposition political parties organized peaceful demonstrations in N’Djamena and other cities across the country to protest Déby running for a sixth term, despite a government ban on public gatherings. Over the course of these demonstrations, police, gendarmes, and soldiers beat protesters with whips, sticks, and batons and arbitrarily detained scores of people.

Security forces used teargas and other forms of force to disperse peaceful protesters in N’Djamena on several occasions including on February 6 and15 and March 20 and 27, injuring dozens of protesters and bystanders. They also arbitrarily arrested at least 112 opposition party members and supporters and civil society activists and subjected some to severe beatings and other ill-treatment. In an attack on the home of a political opposition leader and presidential candidate, Yaya Dillo, on February 28, security forces killed his 80-year-old mother and wounded five other family members.

Presidential elections were held on April 11, 2021. On April 19, the Chadian electoral commission announced that Déby had won a sixth term. On election day, rebels from the Front for Change and Concord in Chad (Front pour l'alternance et la concorde au Tchad, FACT), based in Libya, launched an assault on Chad, attacked a military post in the Western Kanem province, and called on Déby to step down. Clashes between rebels and government forces continued over the following days in the province and the president himself oversaw the fighting. On April 20, a spokesman for the Chadian army announced on national television that Déby, 68, had died of injuries suffered in the clashes. The exact circumstances of his death remain unclear.

Chad’s 2018 Constitution, in force at the time, was clear that in the event of the death of a ruling president, the president of the national assembly should provisionally lead the country for 45 to 90 days before new elections are held. In violation of the constitution, the military spokesman announced that the government and parliament had been dissolved, all borders shut, and a transitional military council (Conseil militaire de transition, or CMT) headed by Mahamat Idriss Déby, one of Déby's sons, was to take over.

The transitional military council suspended the constitution and replaced it with a transitional charter, committing to hold free elections within 18 months, after a national dialogue. Following the suspension of the 2018 constitution, negotiations between the transitional military council and the opposition led to several activists and armed group leaders returning to Chad after years of exile.

Hundreds of members and supporters of opposition parties and civil society organizations united under a coalition known as Wakit Tamma (“the time has come” in Chadian Arabic) and other residents demonstrated in N’Djamena, as well as in Moundou, Doba, and other cities across the country, on April 27 and 28 and May 8 and 19, 2021. The protesters challenged a transitional military council ban on demonstrations and demanded a transition back to civilian rule. Armed forces from the police, gendarmes, and military used excessive force, including indiscriminate live ammunition, to disperse the demonstrations. During these protests, at least seven people were killed, dozens were wounded, and security forces detained more than 700 people, several of whom reported ill-treatment, including torture, in detention. Most were eventually released.

From June through September 2021, the authorities took some positive steps. For example, the government recognized the popular opposition movement Les Transformateurs (The Transformers in French) as a political party and, on June 10, the authorities released Baradine Berdei Targuio, a prominent human rights defender who had been unjustly detained. Thanks to sustained international pressure, the authorities allowed opposition-led demonstrations across Chad during this period.

On October 2, 2021, in an authorized demonstration, hundreds of N’Djamena residents joined members and supporters of Wakit Tamma to protest the CMT’s rule and seek amendments to the transitional charter. Although the authorities had authorized the demonstration, the anti-riot police – and in one case, gendarmes – fired teargas canisters, rubber bullets, and potentially live ammunition at protesters, injuring about 40 to 45 people and damaging private property.

The national dialogue, initially scheduled for February 2022, was delayed, sparking growing calls both in Chad and outside for a civilian-led transition and credible elections.

Following protests on May 14, 2022, the authorities placed six Wakit Tamma members and supporters in “preventive detention” at Klessoum prison, in N’Djamena, on allegations of “gathering to cause public disturbance, harm to property, and physical assault.” The six were then transferred to Moussoro prison, 300 kilometers from the country’s capital, before being eventually released in June after their sentences were suspended.

The national dialogue was convened in August 2022 amid increased tensions in the capital and further protests were organized. Government forces injured scores of protesters in N’Djamena during the first 10 days of September, including with teargas. Security forces also detained over 220 people, including many members of Les Transformateurs, and targeted the Abena neighborhood, where the group’s headquarters is located.

The main rebel groups, opposition parties, and civil society organizations refused to participate in the national dialogue, citing the military’s unwillingness to commit to returning power to civilians.

Tensions boiled over when the national dialogue ended in early October 2022. It concluded by extending the transition (which was meant to end that month) for another two years, and stated that CMT members, including Déby, would be eligible to run in the next national elections. The dialogue also recommended the dissolution of the transitional military council and for Déby to become transitional president.



The Deadly October 20, 2022 Protests

On October 20, 2022, thousands of protestors took to the streets of N’Djamena, and several other cities and towns in southern Chad, including Moundou, Doba, and Sarh.

Armed forces from the police, gendarmes, and military fired live ammunition at protesters, killing and injuring scores, beat people, chased them into homes, and detained them. Relatives and witnesses said that those detained were held in police stations, and in at least one school, in Abena neighborhood of N’Djamena, for several days.

Over the course of its research following the protests, Human Rights Watch collected reliable accounts of several men or boys killed and other men or boys forcibly disappeared. Those forcibly disappeared had been seen being detained by the police or military, but when relatives or friends sought to follow up, they discovered they had not been processed through the court system. Their whereabouts remain unknown.

In the hours following the protests, Chadian authorities said 50 people were killed, including around 15 police officers, and 300 injured. The authorities later adjusted the number of police officers killed to 13, but did not make their identities public. While the full toll of the violence around the October 20 protests is still not known, the National Human Rights Commission (Commission Nationale des Droits de l'Homme, CNDH) rendered the most authoritative national report to date (see below). In its report, released in February 2023, the CNDH listed 128 people killed and 518 injured. The CNDH confirmed that two police officers had been killed, leaving open a discrepancy with official government figures, and raising questions as to whether the government had exaggerated the numbers of dead police officers to justify the use of force.

A national human rights organization, the Chadian League for Human Rights (Ligue tchadienne des droits de l’homme, LTDH) and the World Organization Against Torture (l’Organisation mondiale contre la torture, OMCT), an international coalition of organizations, released a report in April 2023 which stated that 218 protestors had been killed.

The CNDH Report The CNDH report indicates that, despite the stated aim of some of the participants and organizers to demonstrate peacefully, others in the crowd had bladed weapons and attacked the security services with stones. Nevertheless, the report is damning in its main conclusion that the security forces, “systematically violated several fundamental human rights…[using] disproportionate means.” The CNDH further assigned “primary responsibility for human rights violations to agents vested with state authority, namely state security forces.” The report also notes that men in civilian clothes transported in private vehicles with smoked windows used weapons against protesters. It called for an investigation into who these men may have been. The report further stated that “systematic violations of fundamental rights” continued after October 20 through torture, illegal searches, abductions, or arbitrary detentions. It also reported cases of prisoners who died in detention at Koro Toro prison (see below) and that judicial proceedings organized at the prison were not fair. In conclusion, the CNDH asked important questions that have yet to be resolved, including why the government, which was informed of plans for a major demonstration, did nothing concrete to avoid the loss of life? Who gave orders to state security forces to shoot at and kill demonstrators? And why had judicial investigations not been opened into the serious human rights violations? The report also made recommendations to the government, including recommending the prosecution of those responsible for human rights violations.

In the days following the violence, the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), one of Africa’s eight subregional economic communities, announced an investigation commission. While members of the commission interviewed some former detainees at Koro Toro prison, it is unclear if the final report, which is yet to be made public, will highlight abuse at the prison.

In a letter addressed to Human Rights Watch (see Annex II), dated July 6, 2023, the minister of justice reiterated the government’s position that the events of October 20 were not protests, but an insurrection, with the aim of overturning the transitional government.

Succès Masra, opposition leader and president of Les Transformateurs, left the country days after the protests. On November 9, 2022, French lawyers representing Masra announced they had sent the International Criminal Court (ICC) a report of facts qualified as crimes against humanity. On October 5, 2023, Masra informed Chad’s public security minister in a letter that he was planning to return to the country on October 18. That same day, an arrest warrant issued by Chadian authorities, dated from June 2023, appeared on social media. The warrant stated Masra was sought for a variety of crimes including, “attempted attack on constitutional order, incitement to hatred, and an insurrectional uprising.” Days later, on October 8, 2023, at least 72 Les Transformateurs members and supporters were detained in the headquarters of the National Intelligence Service (Agence nationale de sécurité, ANS). They were released weeks later.

Amnesty for the October 20, 2022 Protests and the 2023 Constitution

On November 3, 2023, Masra returned to Chad after he signed, a few days earlier, on October 30, a reconciliation agreement with Chadian authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which guaranteed that he could participate in political activities. This agreement was part of a broader general amnesty granted by the transitional government to “all Chadians, civilians, and military” involved in the October 20 protests. The amnesty law, passed by a national transitional council on November 23, 2023, blocks the possibility of prosecutions for crimes committed during and after the protests.

Chad’s new constitution was approved by a referendum on December 17, 2023. The constitution lowered the minimum age for presidential candidates, thereby allowing Mahamat Idriss Déby, who would have been disqualified under the 2018 constitution, to run in the election. The constitution maintains a central or unified system of government despite some opponents pushing for a federation. Masra campaigned for the referendum to be passed and, on January 1, 2024, he was named prime minister.

Detentions and Transfer of Protesters to Koro Toro Prison

We were like sardines in the vehicle. Everyone was hurt from the beatings. I don’t have the words to describe the journey. It was so difficult. The way we were put in the vehicle, there was no space. We started to fight each other for space. It was terrible. Many were not given water when they were in the [police stations] before we left. We were thirsty in N’Djamena.

– Former detainee at Koro Toro, N’Djamena, April 14, 2023

Of the 72 former detainees interviewed by Human Rights Watch, 15 were detained in the evening of October 19, before the protests started, 46 were detained on Thursday October 20, and 11 were detained on Friday October 21. Human Rights Watch documented other cases of people detained over the course of these three days.

Forty-one former detainees said they were rounded up in N’Djamena and taken directly to police stations known as Public Security Offices (Commissariats de sécurité publique, CSPs). Fourteen former detainees were taken directly to the Central Police Station (Commissariat central) and nine directly to the former police school in town (ex-école de police), located behind the former Ledger Hotel. For many former detainees, inhuman and degrading treatment started at the CSPs, the Commissariat central, and the ex-école de police. The arbitrary manner in which these people were detained is consistent with judicial irregularities and absence of due process that continued once they arrived at Koro Toro. None of the former detainees interviewed by Human Rights Watch was presented to a judge before being transferred to Koro Toro.

Human Rights Watch also confirmed 12 cases in which security forces detained people in a primary school in the Abena neighborhood, in N’Djamena, and harshly beat the detainees. Of these cases, eight were transferred to Koro Toro and the rest were eventually released.

Detainees were transferred to Koro Toro in two convoys: the first, on October 21, consisted of three trucks, with a second two-truck convoy on following day. The trip took approximately 36 hours, but the travel time for each truck varied as some broke down along the way and required repair.

Beatings and Other Ill-treatment during Detention

According to interviewees, the protesters were detained en masse, sometimes as many as 50 or 60 people at a time, then transported across N’Djamena. In most cases the security services transported the men in Toyota trucks, but in some instances, they were transported in large trucks normally used to transport sand. Of the 72 men and boys interviewed by Human Rights Watch, 53 were detained at their homes. A former detainee told Human Rights Watch, “I was detained Thursday afternoon around 1 p.m. at the house by the gendarmes. They just came in and said, ‘Let’s go!’ I was put in a Toyota and taken to CSP 11 in Farcha, where they detained me in a small cell with 38 other men.”

Scores of former detainees said they were beaten in the trucks en route to the CSPs in the city. One man said:

I was arrested by policemen and the soldiers on the 21st in my house in Mbata. It was around 6:30 in the morning. They were doing a door-to-door search. I was arrested with my little brother. When we were arrested the police said, ‘You are the elements of Masra [Succès Masra, the opposition leader], you created trouble.’ They started to beat us straight away with sticks, rubber whips, and their guns as we got into the Toyota. There were maybe a dozen other men [detainees] in the Toyota and we were taken to CSP 11 near the airport in Farcha. They made us lay down on top of each other in the Toyota.

Once at the CSPs, the Commissariat Central, or the ex-école de police beatings seemed arbitrary. Some former detainees said they were treated humanely, including being allowed to use a guard’s phone to call a relative. Others said they were fed or that visiting family members were allowed to bring them food. However, dozens of detainees said they were beaten while in detention in N’Djamena.

One former detainee described how he was detained by soldiers on October 20 and how, after spending the night at the Dembe police post, he was taken the next day to the Commissariat Central. “I was seriously beaten there,” he said. “The police and soldiers hit me on my chest with their guns. They beat me to the ground and continued to beat me. They would yell, ‘Is Masra with you? Masra gave you 2,000 CFA [US$3] to protest, you call him now to come free you!’… I saw many people beaten at the Commissariat Central. At 8 p.m., we were taken to CSP 4 in Soukala neighborhood [and] the police continued to beat people there as well.”

Human Rights Watch interviewed former detainees whom police and soldiers had held in a football field in Abena, close to the party headquarters of Les Transformateurs and the Abena primary school. The men and boys taken to this field were detained by soldiers late on October 19 or early in the morning on October 20 as they tried to congregate near the party headquarters. At this football field, soldiers tied up, beat, and split up the detainees into smaller groups to be taken to CSPs or to unknown locations. One former detainee said, “There were many people there, maybe 200. We spent two hours there. Soldiers beat us with iron rods. Most of us were tied up. Toyota trucks would come and take groups of men to unknown places. They were doing this in stages, we don’t know where some of these men and boys were taken.”

Abuses and Detention in Abena Primary School

Human Rights Watch, the CNDH as well as the LTDH and the OMCT have previously documented how security forces used the Abena primary school, in Abena neighborhood, N'Djamena, as a detention center for at least four days, holding dozens of men, and possibly boys, in small classrooms and beating them severely. The CNDH report quotes several witnesses as having seen men die at the school after being beaten by security forces.

Human Rights Watch spoke with four men who were held in the Abena primary school, taken to Lake Chad, and then transferred to Koro Toro.

One former detainee said:

I was taken to the school at Abena…. where soldiers beat us in the classroom. They called us the “men of Masra” and they beat me with cables and wooden clubs. At 9 p.m., I was tied up abatashar [hands and legs tied behind one’s back] and put in a truck. I saw three Toyota trucks. There were maybe 20 detainees in each. They handled us like we were baggage. If you talked, you had problems. They put us on top of each other. We left for the lake. We arrived at around 6 a.m. [the next day] near Mandi. I knew where we were. They took us out at the lake and untied us. There were many soldiers there, but they got a call from N’Djamena [and they were told to bring us back]. Two men had died in the truck.”

Another man, who was in the same convoy, said:

Soldiers took me to the Abena school, and I was beaten there. I was there all day and they really beat me. At night I was tied up and brought with some men to the lake. Two or three men below us in the Toyota died. They drove like crazy men. We don’t know who died, we were in a state of shock. All I knew was that they were going to kill us. We spent two hours at the lake, and they asked if we supported Masra. They beat us and asked us questions. But then they received calls and they put us back in the truck for N’Djamena.

A former detainee held at the Abena school said:

Soldiers tied me up and beat me with a club and whips. I was beaten until 10 p.m. Then some trucks came. I was still tied up, we were put into Toyotas and taken in different directions. I was taken to the lake. In the morning, we went to Mandi, I heard men saying that. I saw rice farms and water. We got out and I was still tied up. A man had died in our truck. The guards said, “Who is with Masra?” There were maybe 50 of us [detained] at the lake. They shot in the air to scare the locals away. They took off my ropes…. [But] then they took us to Commissariat Central. We took the deceased body with us.

Alleged Killings at Lake Chad

Another former detainee, who was not detained at the Abena school, was also taken to the lake where he saw at least four men being executed. This detainee was detained by soldiers at around 7 a.m. on October 20 and taken to CSP 7 in Chagoua, N’Djamena. He explained that he was tied up with about 30 other men at CSP 7, saying:

Soldiers put about 30 of us into a Toyota, on top of each other. Three men suffocated and died in the Toyota. They were crushed. This was around 9 or 10 p.m. They took 3 Toyotas, each full of around 30 men, and they drove us up to the lake. At the lake, they put us in a line along the water. Then, one soldier said, “Why did you go to protest?” One of the prisoners answered, “for justice and equality.” He was shot in the head, and they threw him in the water. They got to the next man, and he said he was not a protestor. But the soldier said, “No, you lie” and he shot him in the head. The other men started to say they were not protestors, but the soldiers shot them. They got to the 5th man, but then the soldiers got a call and they stopped. The boss walked away, speaking on his phone in Arabic. We were still tied up at the lake. At a certain moment…the ropes were taken off and the soldiers took us back to CSP 12. It was around 3 a.m.

Camp 27

Detainees were taken from N’Djamena to Koro Toro in two waves of military trucks: one convoy of three trucks left N’Djamena on Friday, October 21, and the other one, consisting of two trucks, left on Saturday, October 22. The trucks were large Mercedes Benz trucks owned by the military, which former detainees almost exclusively referred to as “Sarkozies.” The detainees said that the trucks were large, and each carried between 150 to 250 men. One detainee said, “We were many in the Sarkozy. I was in the front. When we were getting in the soldiers counted and I heard one say we were 216.”

The two waves of trucks transported detainees to Koro Toro from a military base known as Camp 27 and located in N’Djamena’s Farcha neighborhood. While many former detainees described how the first 24 hours of detention were chaotic and how they were moved around between different CSPs across the city, almost all confirmed that around 10 to 11 p.m. on October 21, an order seemed to have gone around to take people to Camp 27. One detainee who was held at CSP 6 said that he asked a guard where they may be transferred. The guard told him that he could not say, but that the detainee should try to find water to bring with him.

Former detainees said that their arrival at Camp 27 was chaotic on the night of October 21. They spoke of many military Toyota trucks converging to the camp at around the same time, roughly around 11 p.m. Soldiers, police, and gendarmes were milling about and pushing detainees into large trucks, but tensions were high, and it was difficult to see at night.

Many detainees said they were beaten with whips to move faster into the trucks. Some said they were beaten by guards when they tried to ask where they were going. Others, already injured from being badly beaten in the CSPs were roughly pushed into the trucks. One detainee said, “I had already been harshly beaten when we were taken to the military camp behind the brasserie [Camp 27]. I was thrown into the Sarkozy like a stone.”

Moussa Haroun Tirgo While it is difficult to establish the chain of command and the hierarchy of leadership at Camp 27 on October 21 and 22, over 24 former detainees said they saw the director general of the police of the time, Gen. Moussa Haroun Tirgo. “We spent only 5 minutes at Camp 27. The Director General [of the police] Tirgo, was there, I saw him. He had the full attention of all the others. He told us to get into the Sarkozies and we left,” said a former detainee.” Another detainee described what arriving at the military camp looked like, “Then they took us in a Toyota truck 200 to Camp 27 near the brewery in Farcha. We arrived there and they forced us into Sarkozies with whips. They just pushed us in. The only policeman that I recognized was Tirgo. He was giving orders.” Another detainee said he was pushed into the truck by Tirgo himself, who was yelling in Arabic; “get in fast!” On November 10, 2022, General Tirgo was named a special counsellor to the president, and was then retired, by decree, on June 13, 2023. Human Rights Watch tried to contact Moussa Haroun Tirgo repeatedly, spoke with him briefly by phone on one occasion, but was not able to share the above information with him in a substantive way. Human Rights Watch shared the allegations about Tirgo’s responsibility for the abusive transfer of detainees from Camp 27 to Koro Toro prison with the Chadian government on June 29, 2023. The government did not respond to allegations about Tirgo’s responsibility.

The Road to Koro Toro: “I will never forget the thirst.”

Former detainees said that the trucks were packed so tight with people that it was difficult to move. Many said that this was one of the most difficult parts of the at least 36 hours ride to Koro Toro.

One former detainee said there was no space when he got on the truck, “If you delayed going into the Sarkozy, they beat you... We tried to sit down, but it was too difficult. We were too tight.” Several detainees described how men were so tightly packed their clothing was torn apart, one said: “In our Sarkozy there was no space to move. It was really tight. Our clothes were ripped off from struggling so close together.” Another detainee said it was very difficult to breathe because they were so tightly packed in, describing how men had to lift their heads and turn them to the sky to breathe.

Koro Toro is located approximately 600 kilometers north of N’Djamena. Much of the journey to Koro Toro is over rough dirt roads. The trip took between 36 to 48 hours, with the trucks arriving on Sunday October 23 or Monday October 24. Some trucks broke down on the way and required repair and one had a significant accident in which the driver was injured. Another truck’s partition wall fell in twice on the detainees, causing serious injuries to several. Many detainees – even some who spent several months at Koro Toro – said that the journey to Koro Toro was the worst part of their detention.

Of the five trucks that drove detainees to Koro Toro, three made some type of efforts to provide water to detainees, but it was not sufficient. Many said the suffering was exacerbated by the fact that they were already thirsty when they arrived at Camp 27 and were put into the trucks.

Former detainees interviewed said they begged for water from guards who were stationed in the driver’s cabin. With people so tightly packed in the trucks, the thirst became unbearable once the sun came out. One detainee told Human Rights Watch, “We had no water. They gave us none. When we yelled to the guards in the cabin that we were thirsty they just cocked their guns and pointed them at us and said in Arabic, ‘If you play around, we will kill you…’ We went the entire time with no water.”

One truck stopped near Moussoro, a town 230 kilometers north of N’Djamena, for around 5 minutes, to allow detainees out to drink from a stream near the road.

Another truck also stopped outside of Moussoro, but it did not let the detainees out. After detainees started yelling and begging for water, some guards threw small 500 milliliter water bottles into the truck, but detainees fought for the water and said it was not enough. One detainee from this truck said, “At Moussoro…they gave some water in small [bottles], but there were too many people in the truck and most of us did not get any.” Another detainee from this truck said the men begged for more water, “but the guards said, ‘no it is not possible.’” Some guards from this same truck also attempted to give detainees water from containers that carried diesel fuel, but it was not suitable for drinking.

A third truck stopped north of Moussoro, near a small settlement called Kouba, and allowed some detainees out of the truck to drink water from a stream bed that detainees said appeared to hold water used by goats. “We started to beg them for water,” one detainee said. “We cried, ‘Even if you are going to kill us, give us water.’ So, they let us have dirty water that animals drink.”

Deaths from Dehydration

All detainees interviewed by Human Rights Watch said that thirst or lack of water was their chief concern during the trip. One man said, “When we continued on our way after Moussorro, we asked for water. The guards said, ‘Where we are bringing you, you will die anyway. Why would we bring you water?’” Another detainee said, “When we stopped at one point near Mousorro, we started to really beg for water and a man in uniform shot in the air. He yelled, ‘Stop making so much noise!’”

Former detainees also said that the thirst got worse once they had passed Mousorro, after which some detainees started to die from lack of water.

One detainee said:

People started dying after Mousorro. We yelled to the guards, ‘People are dying here!’ They just said, ‘just let them die.’ People died at night, we sat on their bodies, we had no choice there was no space. We did not bother to take the names of the dead. We all just thought we were going to die so it didn’t matter. We threw two bodies into the desert.

Another man said, “After Moussoro, people started to go crazy and to cry out because of the lack of water. We cried for the soldiers to stop the truck, but they said nothing to us. We cried, ‘We have people dying who need water.’ But they just drank their own bottles calmly.”

Detainees Drinking Urine to Stay Alive Several detainees said they maintained their strength because they assumed they were being transported to the prison at Moussoro. However, once the truck drove past Moussoro, they became desperate to hydrate and at least 30 detainees said they drank their own urine or were given urine to drink by fellow detainees. In some instances, men in the trucks fought over small quantities of urine. “After Moussoro, when we knew we weren’t stopping, people started to go crazy,” one detainee said. “They started drinking their own urine. We had a few small bottles and we passed them around to share urine to drink.” Another detainee told Human Rights Watch: We had to drink our own urine. We all did. I tried to steal other people’s urine at one point. I later found a small piece of plastic and I peed in it but when men saw it, they wanted it, so I swallowed the urine and the plastic. People needed liquid. Another detainee said, “People were drinking their own urine. They were begging their own brothers for their urine.” In some instances, detainees in the trucks resorted to rubbing urine on the bodies of men who had passed out in an attempt to revive them.

Conditions of Detention at Koro Toro Prison

The ministry of justice and human rights manages Koro Toro prison’s administration while the military, the Garde nationale et nomade du Tchad, known by its acronym GNNT, manages security.

Detainees were first brought to Koro Toro 2 (known as Koro Toro Déby) where they were taken out of the trucks, counted, and finally given some water. Some detainees said they were also given oral rehydration salts. At Koro Toro 2, bodies of men who had died (see below) were removed from the trucks and the prisoners were transferred to Koro Toro 1 (known as Koro Toro Habré). Some detainees were in a confused mental state when they arrived and said that they were beaten as a result of it. “I was honestly crazy by this point,” one detainee said. “We were transferred to Koro Toro 1 where we slept outside that night and some other men lost their minds. They spoke badly to the military and were told to sit and be quiet. Some were calling for their wives and children. One man was yelling for his children to bring him water. Another was asking his kids if they were leaving for school. Those of us who yelled were beaten badly, very badly.”

Another detainee said, “I was crazy. I punched a soldier when we arrived and they beat me seriously. They hit me to the ground from behind and then many soldiers were on me and beat me with their guns.”

Abuses by Other Prisoners

Boko Haram is the police of the prison.

If we ate too much food, the Boko Haram would beat us with iron rods.

While soldiers are responsible for the overall security of Koro Toro prison, inside the cells and prisons, the detainees are, in practice, responsible for their own security and organization. Koro Toro 1 and Koro Toro 2 were managed by other detainees chosen by the soldiers, sometimes called “brigadiers” and who, at times, appointed deputies to help them manage other detainees. Brigadiers are prisoners said to have spent long periods at Koro Toro and who, according to former detainees, were given de facto authority by the soldiers to ill-treat other detainees. Former detainees described the brigadiers and their deputies as suspected or convicted members of the Islamist armed group Boko Haram. Human Rights Watch was unable to confirm if these detainees were awaiting trial as accused Boko Haram fighters or if they had already been convicted.

One former detainee, when describing Koro Toro 1, said, “Boko Haram runs the courtyard. They live there in the prison and have chickens and their goats. They are from Nigeria, and some are Arabs. Some are Cameroonians. There are many Boko Haram there.”

Soldiers gave the brigadiers de facto authority to ill-treat other detainees. At least 20 former detainees said they were beaten by brigadiers, while the others said they witnessed brigadiers beat other detainees. Numerous detainees said that beatings by the brigadiers or their deputies were commonplace.

One man said, “there were maybe 50 brigadiers at Koro Toro 1, but they are in charge at Déby too. Boko Haram detainees organized the prisons. They could handcuff, chain, or beat you as a punishment. They would tell you when to work and if you delay or hesitate, they beat you.” Another said, “the Boko Haram watched over us and they really treated us badly. They would beat us for any small mistake. If you drank water without permission, you were beaten. You could not touch the water tap out of turn.”

Another detainee said, “I was hit hard with an iron rod by a Boko Haram prisoner, I still have the scar. I was hit because I went to the toilet without permission. They would hit you for no reason. They would just hit you and say, ‘run!’ but you were chained (shackled) so you couldn’t actually run.”

Rule 40 of the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, or the “Mandela Rules,” provides that “No prisoner shall be employed, in the service of the prison, in any disciplinary capacity.”

Harsh Living Conditions at Koro Toro Prison

Former detainees described harsh living conditions at Koro Toro. Located in the desert, detainees said the prison could get blistering hot during the day and cold at night.

Cramped Accommodations and Inadequate Provisions

Detainees at Koro Toro 1 were crowded into cells and sometimes did not have enough space to move or lie down. The prison did not provide mattresses, sheets, or blankets to newly arrived detainees — these were only provided weeks later by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Food was inadequate – mostly some combination of beans and corn porridge – and former detainees said that the standard ration was once a day. Many detainees said they never bathed at Koro Toro prison.

On arrival, all those detained on account of their participation in the October 20, 2022 protests said they were held in Koro Toro 1 and assigned to specific cells, some with missing doors. Koro Toro 1 was generally described as decrepit. There was little for detainees to do but mill around the courtyard, when the wind was not blowing. One detainee said, “We were 49 in my room. It was difficult to sleep, we all laid in line on the floor. In each cell, the guards picked a chef and a deputy [to run the cell]. The chef was ok, he was one of us. If there was wind, we would stay inside all day long because of the dust. If there was no dust, then we would go outside into the courtyard. The courtyard is a big space. We could walk around.”

Former detainees said that Boko Haram prisoners ran small markets in the prison where they sold tea, cigarettes, and peanuts. They also had animals, including several goats. Some of the cells formerly housed goats. The Boko Haram prisoners also allowed some other detainees to “rent” cell phones and buy small phone memory cards, enabling detainees to bring photos from Koro Toro back to N’Djamena. Some of those photos are printed in this report. Former detainees said they were able to smuggle small amounts of money into the prison from N’Djamena and others said they received money sent by their families through guards.

Chaining of Detainees

At least hundreds of people detained in connection with the October 20, 2022 protests were “chained up” in Koro Toro prison for up to several weeks. The so-called “chains” consisted of iron rods that went round the ankles and were attached to another iron rod. The reasons for this varied: some men were chained because they were in rooms that had no doors and thus there was concern about the potential to escape, others were deemed young and were told they were suspected of attempting to escape, and others were put in chains as a punishment.

Detainees were chained up for periods ranging from one week to two months. They described how chains were never removed, forcing them to sleep and use the toilet while chained.

One detainee described how the chains injured his foot, saying, “At Koro Toro 1 we had chains around our ankles. I was only chained for a week because my foot started to swell up so they had to take it off. It was very uncomfortable in the chains. They never came off, day or night. At Koro Toro 2, some were chained, and some were not.”

One detainee who was held at Koro Toro 1 for two months described how he was chained the entire time, saying, “I was chained up at Habré for two months because I was close to the door. The prosecutor, Rachid, saw me in chains but he did not ask that they be removed. The chains never came off.” Another detainee, who was chained as a punishment said, “I spent three weeks in chains. I had broken a rule; I had gone to the toilet without permission.” Another detainee who had them on for two weeks explained that “The chains hurt very badly. I still have scars and it was difficult to sleep.”

Under the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, adopted in 1955 by the General Assembly and expanded in 2015 as the “Mandela Rules,” chains and irons should never be applied as punishment or used as restraints.

Forced, Abusive Labor

Former detainees explained how many were forced to engage in hard labor when they arrived at Koro Toro prison 2. They were made to build bricks outside the prison that were either used to reinforce prison outer walls or were sold by soldiers in Kouba, some 45 kilometers away. Detainees said they worked in oppressive conditions, under extreme heat, and were denied food and water while working. They were beaten as punishment for refusing to work.

Former detainees told Human Rights Watch that the work was so difficult under direct sunlight, that prison guards would rotate laborers and not make everyone work at once. One detainee said, “At Koro Toro 2, I had to make bricks. I did this for maybe eight days. I had no choice. The soldiers made us do it…They would take us out 14 at a time to make bricks…We worked from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. You were picked in your room. They would say, ‘You have no right to discuss, get to work.’ The work was difficult, and we were not given anything to eat out there.”

Another detainee said, “I made bricks and then did three days of construction. We had to work, we did not have a choice. The soldiers would pick us, and the Boko Haram would supervise. The bricks were also put in a truck and the soldiers would take them to Kouba to sell them. We would watch the soldiers fight among themselves over the money. We were not paid for this work. We would work from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m.... You couldn’t refuse to work – people were beaten all the time.”

The treatment of detainees in Koro Toro prison does not comply with international human rights safeguards on the use of prison labor. According to the Mandela Rules, prison labor must be of a vocational, not afflictive nature, and prisoners should be allowed to choose the type of work they wish to perform. The work must not be driven by financial profit motives. Moreover, only detainees who have been convicted may work, and they must undergo medical assessment of their health and fitness for work. Prisoners must also be treated and remunerated fairly on terms close to what free workers receive.

“Soulou’’ or Solitary Confinement

Both Koro Toro 1 and 2 have small cells – not large enough for one person to fully lay down – without windows or other sources of light. Detainees called them “soulou.” Such cells were used to punish detainees and are described as small spaces where sometimes more than one person was detained at a time. Most detainees who were punished with the soulou were put inside the room for 24 hours.

One detainee said, “I was put in the soulou because I had to wash my hands outside after eating and I missed the roll call in my room. There is no food or water there. I was just pushed in, there was no light.”

Another detainee said, “I refused to wash a soldier’s clothes and I was put in the soulou for 24 hours. In the soulou, there is nothing. It’s all dark, you stay there and urinate on the floor. Then you leave. I was sent back a second time for asking about my judicial case. You don’t have the right to do that.”

Rule 43 of the Mandela Rules prohibits indefinite solitary confinement, as well as the placement of a prisoner in a dark or constantly lit cell. It categorizes the practice as cruel, inhuman, or degrading and prohibits its practice.

Detention of Children in Koro Toro Prison According to an internal list made by authorities at Koro Toro, and seen by Human Rights Watch, at least 82 children were taken to Koro Toro after October 20. The listed children were given conditional release in December 2022 and returned to N’Djamena. Human Rights Watch interviewed one man who was a child when he was taken to Koro Toro, another man who lied about his age to be considered a child and thus released early, and one child who was 13 years old when he was taken to Koro Toro. The boy who was 13 years old at the time he was taken to Koro Toro spoke about his detention and treatment at the prison: I heard the noise of the protests in the Atron neighborhood, and I walked out of my house. The police saw me, grabbed me, and started beating me. They said, “you are stubborn. We will beat you in prison.” There were already three detainees in the back of the pick-up. They beat, kicked, and hit us with their guns as we laid down. They took us to CSP 15 in Boutalbaka…. On Friday, late at night, we were taken to Camp 27. There, I saw 3 Sarkozies and policemen and soldiers were managing things…I was put in the second Sarkozy…the guards just said, “You are a stubborn child, you used slingshots against the police. We will take you someplace to beat you.” There were many people in the Sarkozy. After Moussoro, one man, about my father’s age, died right next to me and we had to throw his body out.…We were packed like sardines, it was really hot. I saw people drink their own urine. Men started to fight each other…I think we threw four bodies out of our Sarkozy and when we arrived we had another four dead bodies. People tried to jump out of the Sarkozy and the guards would shoot at them. I saw one guy shot [as he tried to escape]. Someone died at my feet in the truck. I have nightmares about it. I want to talk to someone about what happened to me. At Koro Toro Habré I was put in a room with the adults… I was not beaten by Boko Haram, but they beat other people… The boy’s father told Human Rights Watch that the boy screamed every night for weeks after he arrived home in N’Djamena, complained of pain in his back and legs, would not eat, nor want to get out of bed. The conditions that existed in Koro Toro violates the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which Chad ratified in October 1990, and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child. The CRC prohibits the arrest, detention, or imprisonment of a child except in conformity with the law and only as a “measure of last resort,” mandating that “no child shall be deprived of his or her liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily.” The convention also obligates governments to protect children from “all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation…while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child.” The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child obligates states to “ensure that no child who is detained or imprisoned or otherwise deprived of his/her liberty is subjected to torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.” The CRC has similar provisions protecting children. The detention of children in the same facilities as adults is prohibited by both treaties unless under specific circumstances.

Deaths in Custody

Human Rights Watch is not able to confirm how many people linked to the October 20 protests were killed or died in custody following their detention. Several detainees however gave accounts of deaths they witnessed at Lake Chad, on the trucks to Koro Toro, and at the prison, all of which totaled between 34 and 38. Human Rights Watch was able to independently corroborate 11 of these cases, some of which were also confirmed by the CNDH. However, based on reliable testimonies, these numbers are likely to be significantly higher. Only a thorough investigation, which should be conducted by Chadian authorities with international support, will establish how many people died after October 20 and en route to and at Koro Toro.

Fourteen detainees from Koro Toro interviewed by Human Rights Watch said they helped throw bodies out of trucks en route to the prison, while dozens of others said they witnessed bodies being thrown out.

Several detainees from one truck spoke of a young girl, one of only two females who are believed to have been transferred to Koro Toro, who died in transit. Some detainees said her name may have been Aïcha.

One detainee who was near her in the truck said, “There was a young girl in our Sarkozy, around 13 years old. I asked her how old she was, she said she was 13 years old. She died after Moussoro. We yelled, ‘We have someone dead!’ But the guards just yelled back, ‘Dying is nothing.’ They had no pity. We did not have space to turn around. The guards told us to throw her body out, but the men refused to do so. The guards loaded their guns and one yelled ‘Throw the dead out!’ We said among ourselves, ‘Ok, if someone else dies, don’t tell the guards because they will make us throw the body out of the truck.’ The [body of the] girl was thrown out.”

Another detainee from the same truck said, “There was a very small girl, maybe 12 years old, in the truck. She was crying a lot and at one point she fell. I don’t know if she was dead already or if she was trampled to death. The guards said to throw her body out. They loaded their weapons and yelled that they would shoot us. So, we threw her body [out] while we were moving. I don’t know who she was.”

Another detainee identified the dead man whose body he threw from the truck as François, a father of at least three children, who said he had initially been detained at his home. The detainee said François had then been detained at the former police school in N’Djamena with him.

Many detainees said they could not say categorically how many people had died on the way to Koro Toro as they were not thinking well due to dehydration. One detainee said, “I think that we threw four bodies out of the Sarkozy, but we had three dead in our Sarkozy when we arrived, so maybe we had seven dead. But it is hard to say, when we arrived it was everyone for themselves.”

Many men also jumped from the trucks during the desert ride in a desperate attempt to escape, even though guards shot at those who tried to escape. However, Human Rights Watch identified at least two men who did manage to make it back to N’Djamena. One man explained why he decided to jump. “When I saw that girl die, when people started dying, I said to myself, ‘between life and death I’ll have a choice. If they kill me, I’ll make sure I have a choice.’ … After Moussoro, I climbed [over] the truck wall and jumped. A guy followed me down. The guards shot at us when we jumped but we were not hit.” Another said he had managed to escape from his truck but was later captured in the desert by soldiers in a small truck serving as an escort. Dozens of detainees said that guards shot at men who tried to escape, but they could not say if these men survived.

Several detainees said that, after the first day, the guards in their trucks stopped forcing them to throw bodies out. One detainee said, “The thirst was terrible. We weren’t sweating, we didn’t have any water. The guards did nothing. When the first [detainee] died, we threw him out because he died early and the guards told us to throw his body out, but when the others died, we just kept the bodies, the guards didn’t care.”

Another detainee said, “After Moussoro people started dying. My neighbor said, ‘I’m going to die, I’m going to die.’ He was begging for water. The soldiers said, ‘If he dies it is not a problem. Let him die.’ He put his head on my knees…he couldn’t hold his head up. Soon enough, he was dead. We used our last energy to move him up in the Sarkozy and we made a space around the extra tire for his body.”

Independently Verified Deaths in Custody

Human Rights Watch was able to verify the identity of 11 men who either died in transit to Koro Toro or at the prison. In three of the cases documented by Human Rights Watch, the men were beaten severely and then died, either en route or at Koro Toro. Based on witness accounts, the men may have died because of these beatings. In one case, a man was sick before the trip to Koro Toro and died in transit, likewise for another man who was said to be exhausted. One man was said to be exhausted when he arrived at Koro Toro, and he died shortly after. Two men died because of the accident in which the partition wall collapsed from a truck. In the other three cases Human Rights Watch could not confirm exactly how the men died but did confirm their deaths.

The following accounts are based on interviews with family members of the victims, witnesses, and other sources of information, including (in some cases) confirmation from the CNDH. However, as noted above, only a full investigation would provide an accurate accounting of the total number and identities of those who died in transit to and at Koro Toro prison. Huma Rights Watch heard reliable testimonies of several other men (and one girl) who died en route to Koro Toro but was not able to independently corroborate these cases.

To date, Chadian authorities have failed to carry out prompt, impartial, and effective investigations into the circumstances and causes of any of the deaths in custody. This is the standard required under international law, as part of states’ procedural obligations under respect for the right to life and it is set out in the UN Minnesota Protocol on the Investigation of Potentially Unlawful Death. The protocol also provides that “family members should be informed immediately and thereafter a notification of death posted in an easily accessible way. To the extent possible, family members should also be consulted prior to an autopsy. They should be entitled to have a representative present during the autopsy … [H]uman remains should be returned to family members, allowing them to dispose of the deceased according to their beliefs.”

Blaise Djikossi

Blaise Djikossi was killed in an accident involving the truck he was being transported in en route to Koro Toro on either October 21 or 22. Djikossi was detained at his home in Morsal, N’Djamena, on October 20. A witness to his detention described how Djikossi was hiding in the shower and was taken by the police. He was then taken to the CSP 6 before being transferred to the police headquarters. A family member said, “The family tried to visit him at the police headquarters, but we were not allowed in.”

On November 2, this same family member was visited by an official from the government who said, “your [relative] died in a truck accident [en route to Koro Toro]. Others died in the accident too, but this should stay a secret.” However, this official stressed that he was speaking to them in an unofficial capacity and that the information was not to be shared.

This information was confirmed by a former detainee from Koro Toro who was in the same truck as Djikossi. He said, “The driver was going very fast on the dirt roads. We were in the bush. As we went up a sand hill, the partition wall of the truck broke. It broke because there were too many of us in the truck. The guards tied the partition wall up, but it broke again, and we all fell out while the truck was moving. Four men died in that accident, but I only knew Blaise. I did not know the others who died. We put the bodies back in the truck.”

In April 2023, a family member said, “We heard Blaise died in the accident, but we don’t know where his body is. We have no official notification that he is dead. Nobody has called to tell us that he is dead. We have no closure.” Djikossi was born in 1992.

Blaise Djikossi’s identity was possibly confirmed by the CNDH report which listed one “Nanta Tchakozi Blaise” as one of the lifeless bodies that arrived at Koro Toro on October 23.

Vincent Bakouboup

Click to expand Image Vincent Bakouboup. © 2022 Private

Vincent Bakouboup, around 28 years old, was detained at his home in Morsal on October 20. Three friends said he was ill and was in bed that day. Nevertheless, security forces broke down his door while doing door to door searches for protestors and detained 10 men who lived in the same compound as him. The men were all brought to the CSP 6 in Morsal. One of the men detained with him said, “The police and gendarmes beat us at CSP 6. They beat us with clubs, their guns, and iron rods. I was covered in blood. As they beat us, they said, ‘You are elements of Masra, he gave you 2,000 CFA [USD $3] to drink alcohol, he can come free you now.’ Vincent was beaten too. He had malaria and was sick.”

The same former detainee said he was transferred to CSP 12 that same day with Bakouboup and that they were both put in the same truck at Camp 27 on October 21. He said, “I was in the same Sarkozy as Vincent. We were with more than 200 other men. It was tight and I lost him in the crowd. Everyone was thirsty. We couldn’t speak. In the truck each man was on his own. Vincent was sick before he went in, and he died in the truck. It was his state of health and the condition of transport that killed him.”

Two other former detainees who shared a truck with Bakouboup confirmed that their truck needed some minor repair roughly 50 kilometers before Koro Toro. At this moment, Bakouboup’s body was put into a Toyota escort car. “Vincent had blood coming out of his mouth,” one of the men said.

Another man said he thought he saw Bakouboup’s body among a line of dead bodies, but he could not confirm this. “They did not want us to go near the bodies at KT to identify them,” he said.

A family member of Bakouboup said he confirmed through unofficial channels that Bakouboup was dead but that “his name was not on any list.” “We got no call, no official note,” he added.

“We did the mourning, but that is hard to do without the body,” he said. “We did not have the chance to inform the entire family. It hurts, he’s buried in the desert. We can’t even go to visit his grave; the family can’t point to where the body is.”

Vincent Bakouboup’s identity was possibly confirmed by the CNDH report which listed one “Bekemble Vincent” as one of the lifeless bodies that arrived at Koro Toro on October 23.

Ngaba Djmadoum

Click to expand Image Ngaba Djmadoum. © 2022 Private

Ngaba Djmadoum, 31 years old, was detained on October 20 for participating in the protests. A man detained with Djmadoum said they were detained in Abena near Les Transformateurs’ headquarters. “We were stopped by the police who asked if we were protestors. We said we were not, but they checked our phones and asked what we had filmed. My phone was broken, so they said I could go. But they kept Ngaba because he was a rasta. He was walked straight to the Abena school.” Friends and family confirmed Djmadoum wore his hair in dreadlocks.

Human Rights Watch was not able to confirm Djmadoum’s presence at the Abena primary school, which security forces used as a detention center for at least four days. They held dozens of men, and possibly boys, in small classrooms and beat them. Several men however said they saw Djmadoum in transit to Koro Toro. One man in the truck with him said, “I saw Ngaba at Camp 27, he was alive in the Sarkozy, but he died on the voyage. He was in good form when we left. I could see him. After Mousorro he just got too tired, and he was scared. There was no space. He fell and he was trampled.”

Another former detainee who was transported alongside Djmadoum said, “Ngaba fell down in the truck. He was yelling things, he said he could see his grandfather. Sadly, after he died we had to stand on or sit on his body. You need to understand, we had no space. Ngaba was in good health, he was a young man, but it was that second day [in the truck] and after Mousorro that he started to lose his head.”

A third former detainee, who also saw Djmadoum die said, “Ngaba had laid down and was asking for water. People were stepping on him, he was crying out. We cried to the guards, ‘There are people dying here!’ But they just said, ‘if he dies then throw him out.’”

Djmadoum’s body was brought to Koro Toro where he was buried. A family member explained that he learned of his death through other former detainees. He said, “We received no call from the government, no letter. The family mourned, but we were really hurt. We are still in shock. We want the body, we want to put it in a cemetery. Now he is just abandoned in the desert.”

Ngaba Djmadoum was likely the same person listed in the CNDH report as “Ngueto (a guitarist),” one of the lifeless bodies that arrived at Koro Toro on October 23. “Ngueto” is similar to “Ngaba” and Djmadoum was known to be a musician. Multiple sources however said that two men, both known as musicians with dreadlocks, died en route to Koro Toro and one of the men’s bodies may have been thrown from a truck.

Magloire Mbaiadjim

Four separate witnesses confirmed that, 36 years old Magloire Mbaiadjim, also known by his nickname “Joe de la Barbe,” was hiding in a toilet when he was detained by police

conducting door-to-door searches in Morsal. One witness said, “Many soldiers came into this concession. They shot at a door. Joe de la Barbe was taken, with many other men. They were all put into Toyota trucks.”

According to two former detainees, Mbaiadjim was taken to CSP 7 in Chagoua. One man detained with him said, “There were many men in the courtyard at CSP 7. The soldiers beat us a lot with sticks and cords both in the trucks and there.” Mbaiadjim was then taken to CSP 10 before being moved to Camp 27 to be forced into trucks for Koro Toro.

Another former detainee, who was beaten with Mbaiadjim at CSP 7, said he lost track of him until he saw him again at Koro Toro, “The next time I saw him was at Koro Toro and he had lost his senses. He screamed at the soldiers, so he was kicked and beaten badly with iron rods that first day.”

Several other former detainees confirmed that Mbaiadjim arrived at Koro Toro in a state of shock. He was screaming incoherently at soldiers, who started to beat him. One former detainee said, “Poor Magloire, he gave the soldiers a hard time and they beat him badly and tortured him at Habré. There were so many soldiers. He fell and they kicked him and used their guns to beat him.”

One former detainee who was in the cell with Mbaiadjim when he died at Koro Toro 1 said, “Magloire was chained up and he died in our cell. We only had some dried grains to give him. He cried and he cried, he was in a lot of pain. There was no doctor for him.”

Another former cell mate said, “Magloire just cried and cried and cried in pain. We tried to give him some water and he would try to take it. He died later. When he died, we called the soldiers to take his body, but they said, ‘No, one is not enough, we will let five or six die first.’ On Saturday morning the soldiers dragged the body out and took it to Koro Toro 2 to be buried. He was just buried in the sand.”

A relative of Mbaiadjim said, “It’s difficult for us to accept that he is dead because we did not see the body… He had a future ahead of him. We want to bring him home, bring his body back, and bury him with dignity so we can visit the grave.”

Mbaiadjim’s death at Koro Toro was registered by the CNDH as having occurred on October 25.

Joachin Weiyenbal

Joachin Weiyenbal was a 57-year-old father of five from Paris-Congo, a neighborhood in N’Djamena’s 6th arrondissement. According to people close to him, Weiyenbal did not participate in the protests, but left his house in the afternoon of October 20, to discuss the situation with neighbors. Witnesses said he hid at a neighbor’s home when security forces came to the door and that he was beaten before he was put into a Toyota truck.

His family members were able to trace him to the police headquarters. One family member said, “I saw [him], in the courtyard at the police station. He was there under a big hanger, by the door. I saw him, but he did not see me. He was sitting on the ground with his head hung low. I asked to see him, but the guards refused to let me speak to him. I recognized his clothes.”

On October 21, Weiyenbal’s family members went to see him again at the police headquarters but were told by guards that he had been moved to a CSP in the city. The guards did not say which one.

From then on, the family had no news until February 2023, when a former detainee gave them the telephone number of a guard in Mousorro who confirmed that Weiyenbal had died shortly after his arrival at Koro Toro.

A relative also said they spoke with a former detainee who said Weiyenbal died after his torture and the journey.

Two former detainees at Koro Toro confirmed that they saw Weiyenbal struggle on the trip to Koro Toro and two others said they saw his body after he died at Koro Toro 1.

A family member said, “We don’t know where he is buried. He was just thrown in the desert. We want his body brought back here to have a traditional funeral. Justice for us, the family, would be to bring his body back so we can bury him here.”

Weiyenbal’s death at Koro Toro was registered by the CNDH as having occurred on October 25.

Hubert Mbaindiguem

Hubert Mbaindiguem, about 27 years old, who was also called “Firmain,” left his home in Ambata on October 19 to participate in the protests. A family member said they were told by Mbaindiguem’s friends that he had spent that night at Les Transformateurs’ headquarters in Abena. This family member searched for him unsuccessfully on October 21, checking the former police school, Abena primary school, and several CSPs.

This same family member received news about Mbaindiguem in December 2022 from a former detainee at Koro Toro. “The guy said Hubert had injuries on his head and that his jaw was broken. He said that Hubert had died on November 4.”

A man who was detained with Mbaindiguem at CSP 7 said Mbaindiguem was badly beaten there, “He was hurt at CSP 7, he had been seriously beaten in the head by soldiers. At CSP 7, a policeman said to him, “you are going to die. [Later] he was in the Sarkozy with me.”

Three other former detainees said that Mbaindiguem was injured and acting strange. One said, “it was like he had epilepsy or something.” He was put in the soulou where he died. Another said, “I was brought to the soulou to identify him. They wrote his name down and registered it.”

A family member of Mbaindiguem said, “I want my [relative], whether he is dead or alive, I want him back. The government needs to bring his body back. I want to know where my [relative] is buried, I want to take my family to see his grave. What affects me most is this uncertainty. If he is dead, he is dead, but I want to bury him. But without his grave, I will always have doubts in my head and this hurts.”

Mbaindiguem’s death at Koro Toro was registered by the CNDH as having occurred on November 3.

Elias Rebessengar, a 22-year-old university student, was detained in the early afternoon on October 20 in Kamada, N’Djamena, where he was hiding in a neighbor’s home. A former detainee, who was detained with Rebessengar said, “The soldiers knocked on the door and entered. They yelled “Lay down!” and they checked the rooms. After they checked the rooms they yelled, “Get up!” and told us to go to the main road. Elias was with us as we stood just next to the road with maybe 80 people… At 1:30 p.m., we were taken to the police headquarters in a civilian truck, one used to move sand.”

Eight former detainees who were in a truck whose retaining partition wall broke twice en route Koro Toro said detainees spilled out into the desert and some were hurt. According to four former detainees, Rebessengar was among those badly injured. One man who was with Rebessengar said, “I was there. Elias fell out the second time the partition wall of the truck fell. Everyone was too weak to speak… [but] it was clear that he was not in good shape.” Another witness said that it was clear Rebessengar’s neck had been badly injured.

Despite his injuries, Rebessengar was brought to Koro Toro 1 and put to a cell. Five former detainees said that, for about 10 days, after arriving at Koro Toro 1, Rebessengar could not speak and barely moved. One man said, “He couldn’t speak, and we had to force him to eat… He didn’t speak the entire time [until] he died.” Another man said, “Elias was in room 21. He couldn’t speak, he couldn’t even open his eyes.”

A worker at Koro Toro prison who saw Rebessengar said, “For Elias, there was no help for him. We called Moussoro prison for him, but they did not come to take him.”

Former detainees said that the guards at Koro Toro did not show much interest in helping Rebessengar. One former detainee said, “Elias never spoke, he died before the prosecutor came [in early November]. The guards asked, ‘Who is this guy?’ But they did not do much.”

Rebessengar’s death at Koro Toro was registered by the CNDH as having occurred on November 1.

A relative of Rebessengar who said that they were informed of his death by returning detainees expressed despair, saying “We can’t get his body. The family is still in shock that a young man with a future can die so far from us. We are still in shock because he was our future…The shock is real.”

Maxime Rimtebaye

Maxime Rimtebaye, known as “Rim,” a 31-year-old butcher, was detained on October 20 at his home in Walia, N’Djamena.

A man who was detained with Rimtebaye described his detention and subsequent death:

Rim was arrested 15 minutes after me. We spent the night together in CSP 9 in Walia. They beat us at CSP 9 on the 20th and the 21st. Rim was hit all over at CSP 9 with a stick. We were brought to the police headquarters on the 21st around 9 or 10 p.m.. There we were beaten again. Rim was hit hard in the head. He was wearing black jeans, I remember it. [From there] we were taken to different CSPs.

I saw Rim when I was later taken to Camp 27.

When we arrived at Koro Toro a guy said, “A young man in black jeans was badly hurt in the head, he died in our Sarkozy.”

I saw three bodies pulled out of one Sarkozy, but I didn’t see if Rim was one of them. It was only later that I learned that he had died. We were all a bit crazy after the voyage.

A family member of Rimtebaye said: “We organized the mourning. His mother died from a heart attack after she learned of his death. So, we had to do the mourning for both her and Rim. We want his body back. He is our brother. Why is he buried up in the desert? We want to bury him with humanity.”

Rimtebaye’s case does not appear to have been documented by the CNDH.

Medard Rimbar

Medard Rimbar, 35 years old, was detained sometime in the late afternoon or early evening of October 20. According to family members, he left his home in Walia, N’Djamena, sometime after 5 p.m. with a friend and never returned. The next day, on October 21, a policeman called a family member saying Rimbar had been detained. However, when they called the policeman back on October 22, they were told that Rimbar had been “deported” to Koro Toro.

Rimbar was registered by the CNDH as having died at Koro Toro prison on October 23.

The family said they checked morgues across N’Djamena but found nothing. One member said, “We have not done the mourning yet, but will organize it. We want his body back. We are in shock now.”

Toralbaye Mayadjim

According to a family member, Toralbaye Mayadjim, a father of three, was detained at the door of his home on October 20 while speaking with a neighbor. His family members searched in vain for Mayadjim at police stations across N’Djamena.

Human Rights Watch could not confirm how Mayadjim died at Koro Toro but heard reliable information that he arrived at the prison with a seriously injured foot.

Mayadjim’s death at Koro Toro prison was registered by the CNDH as having occurred on October 24.

A family member said, “We never got any message from the state saying he was at Koro Toro… We want his body brought back so his family can pay their respects. What is sure is that he is no longer with us, but we are not comfortable with him buried in the desert.”

Moutengar Igneigor

According to family members, Moutengar Igneigor, 33, was likely detained on October 20 when he was returning from work to his home in Walia, in N’Djamena. Family members searched for him at CSPs across the city but were unable to establish his whereabouts. The family said that, in April 2023, they received word from the ICRC that Igneigor died either in transit or at Koro Toro prison where his body remains.

Family members lamented that Igneigor has left his three children behind and that they cannot mourn his death properly without his body. “We want the body brought back here,” one family member said.

Igneigor’s case does not appear to have been documented by the CNDH.





Trials at Koro Toro Prison

There was no strategy during the trial, they just made things up.

– Former detainee at Koro Toro, N’Djamena, April 16, 2023

The legitimacy of the alleged grounds for the vast majority of the protestors’ detentions is very dubious. The Chadian government alleges that those detained were caught in flagrante committing crimes (flagrant délit) during the protests or were committing the crime of insurrection.

None of those detained in connection with the October protests were brought before a judge to be charged with a credible offence and remanded into custody before being transferred to and held in Koro Toro. Hundreds of men and many boys were held at Koro Toro in violation of due process, and therefore arbitrarily and in violation of international law, for weeks on end. Also in violation of international law, they were held together with detainees who had been convicted of serious crimes, in conditions described above, that violate the absolute prohibition on torture and inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment.

However, by early December 2022, 401 detainees had been put on trial in Koro Toro prison for a range of crimes such as unauthorized gathering, destroying property, arson, and disturbing public order. Over the course of the next several months, an additional 150 and 200 others were put on trials for similar charges. Those prosecuted were those allegedly caught in the act of protesting.

The trials in Koro Toro violated the most basic due process and fair trial standards. The trials were held in this remote prison location, far from the capital where the defendants were detained, which effectively ensured that they had no access to family members or lawyers, and therefore, at the very least, no possibility of preparing an effective defense.

Investigation of crimes in Chad is a function of the Judicial Police, who questions suspects and provides evidence to the prosecutor (Ministère Public). Notes are taken during the interrogation by a judicial police officer (Officier de la Police Judiciaire, OPJ). Most detainees said the interrogation at Koro Toro lasted only a few minutes and involved the OPJs presenting a variety of weapons such as guns, knives, sling shots, or small plastic sachets of alcohol, and telling the detainees to choose what they used and admit they were part of an insurrection. The detainees did not have legal representation during these interrogations.

Several detainees spoke of a rushed and arbitrary process. Detainees were also told to confess in order to be released. One detainee, who was detained at his house in N’Djamena’s Atron neighborhood said, “During my interrogation, the OPJ put guns and other weapons on a mat and said, ‘Which weapons did you use?’ I took a large stick and said, ‘Ok, I used this.’ We had to say it to be let go. They said only those who confessed would be freed. I was tired.”

The trials were held in a small building outside of Koro Toro 2. Detainees were tried in large groups of between 20 and 30 men at a time. Some said they had only minutes in front of a judge. One detainee said, “During the trial I was shown weapons, but I said I did not ",VERY HIGH,20240806T071500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Former President Idriss Déby Itno, Gen. Mahamat Idriss Déby, Gen.

Chad’s military is responsible for the deaths in custody of several detainees en route to and at Koro Toro prison following the October 2022 protests over the extension of the transition government.

Chadian military officials oversee a prison in which abuse runs rampant and are responsible for the deaths of protesters detained in the wake of the October 20, 2022 protests.

The Chadian government should close one Koro Toro building and repair the other. Anyone held there without charge should be freed immediately. International partners should evaluate their support.

(Nairobi) – Chad’s military is responsible for the deaths in custody of several detainees en route to and at Koro Toro prison in October 2022, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. The prisoners were unlawfully detained, mistreated, and denied basic supplies during the two to three days transit from the capital city to the prison.

The 77-page report, “‘Worse Than Hell’: Death and Torture at Chad’s Koro Toro Prison,” documents in detail the detention of 72 people, several of whom were tortured or ill-treated at Koro Toro following the October 20 protests in the Chadian capital, N’Djamena, and in several other towns, to protest the two years extension of the transitional government. Security forces fired live ammunition at protesters. Hundreds were then taken to Koro Toro, a high security prison about 600 kilometers away. The transition ended in May 2024 with the election of Gen. Mahamat Idriss Déby.

“Chadian military officials oversee a prison in which abuse runs rampant and are responsible for deaths of protesters detained in the wake of the October 20, 2022 protests,” said Lewis Mudge, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “The government should act to address the impunity for these abuses that has led many victims to give up all hope for justice.”

The remains of those who died should be returned to their families for burial, and one of the main buildings at Koro Toro should be closed as it is unfit to be used as a detention center, Human Rights Watch said. Chadian authorities, the African Union, and United Nations bodies should immediately investigate unlawful detention and ill-treatment at Koro Toro and all deaths in custody.

Human Rights Watch interviewed more than 150 people during 2023 and 2024, including 72 former detainees, family members of detainees who died en route to or at Koro Toro, government officials, and members of civil society. Human Rights Watch matched geographic features seen and verified from images obtained from former detainees with satellite imagery to locate the prison site. It used this material, along with sketches provided by victims, to construct diagrammatic models of the prison.

Koro Toro is comprised principally of two prisons, known as Koro Toro 1, or Koro Toro Habré, and Koro Toro 2, or Koro Toro Déby, located about one kilometer apart. Koro Toro 1 is older than Koro Toro 2 and is in decrepit condition. Human Rights Watch found that it lacks even the most basic standards of care. Both compounds house suspects who have yet to be charged with a crime, pretrial detainees, and convicted prisoners.

The prison, which was designed to house “violent extremists,” is hundreds of kilometers from major urban centers and cut off from the outside world with no cell phone reception, making it practically impossible for family members and lawyers to visit.

En route to Koro Toro, most detainees were denied food and – more important – water, over two to three days. One former detainee said that when it was clear the trucks would not stop for water, he and other detainees started to drink their own urine. “We had a few small bottles, and we passed them around to share urine to drink,” he said.

Some detainees died in transit, presumably from delirium and hunger. Former detainees said the guards told them to throw the bodies out of the trucks. Human Rights Watch documented the deaths of at least four people en route to the prison, six others at the prison, and of one man whose death occurred in either of those places, although the real number of dead is most likely much higher. Relatives were not officially informed of the deaths, although some were told informally. Almost two years on, none of the remains have been released to their families.

Former detainees said that, while soldiers from the national army guarded the prison, day-to-day administration was managed by prisoners suspected of having links to the Islamist armed group Boko Haram. They punished and beat other detainees, oversaw food distribution, and ran a small market. Former detainees said that the soldiers gave these prisoners de facto authority to ill-treat and beat others.

At least hundreds of people detained at Koro Toro in connection with the October 20 protests were “chained up” with iron rods around their ankles and attached to another iron rod for up to several weeks. Some were subjected to prolonged solitary confinement, a form of torture, and forced labor.

Judicial proceedings for the detainees were held in the prison by the Tribunal of N’Djamena. Based on interviews with former detainees, the interrogations and judicial proceedings were hurried and fell far short of fair trial standards. Most of the accused were convicted and then pardoned.

The Chadian government maintains that the October 20, 2022 protests amounted to an insurrection and that, given the seriousness of this crime, detention at Koro Toro was not extreme. In a July 2023 letter to Human Rights Watch, Chad’s justice minister stated that there was “no evidence relating to the violation of human rights related to [the] transfer or detention in Koro-Toro prison.”

The Chadian government should immediately close Koro Toro 1 and ensure urgent repairs at Koro Toro 2 to make it adequate for holding prisoners, including installing a means for detainees to communicate with their families and lawyers. No one should be detained at Koro Toro prison without charges, and anyone currently so held should be released immediately, Human Rights Watch said.

Failing a serious effort by the Chadian government to confront ill-treatment and torture at Koro Toro, Chad’s international partners should evaluate financial and other support, including training and capacity-building to institutions directly involved in these violations.

“Mahamat Idriss Déby’s government should demonstrate its respect for the rule of law by closing down Koro Toro 1 and bringing conditions at Koro Toro 2 up to human rights standards,” Mudge said. “The authorities should immediately investigate detainee deaths both en route to and at Koro Toro and prosecute those responsible for this and other abuses in detention.”",HIGH,20240806T051500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Lewis Mudge (Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch), Gen.

(Bangkok) – Thailand’s Constitutional Court dissolved the opposition Move Forward Party on August 7, 2024, based on politically motivated allegations, seriously damaging the country’s return to genuine democratic rule, Human Rights Watch said today.

The nine-judge Constitutional Court unanimously ruled that the Move Forward Party committed treason by advocating reform of Penal Code section 112 on lèse-majesté (insulting the monarchy) and imposed 10-year political bans on all of its executive members, who were in office from April 2021 to January 2024. The case had been brought by the national Election Commission.

“The Thai Election Commission’s case against the Move Forward Party was a sham right from the start,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The Constitutional Court’s ruling to dissolve the Move Forward Party is a severe blow to Thailand’s teetering efforts to restore democratic rule after years of military dictatorship.”

The Election Commission accused the Move Forward Party, which won the largest number of seats in the May 2023 general elections, of high treason and petitioned the Constitutional Court to dissolve the party and impose the maximum 10-year ban from politics on its executives under section 92 of the Act on Political Parties. The Election Commission filed its petition in April without allowing the party to counter the allegations.

The Election Commission’s case is based on the Constitutional Court’s ruling on January 31 that the Move Forward Party’s campaign to amend the lèse-majesté law amounted to an attempt to abolish Thailand’s constitutional democracy with the king as head of state, contravening the constitution. Article 49 of Thailand’s constitution prohibits people from using their rights and freedoms to overthrow the monarchy.

The Constitutional Court referred to its January ruling, saying there was evidence that the Move Forward Party tried to either change or revoke section 112 on March 25, 2021, when its 44 members of parliament submitted a bill to amend the section. The court also ruled that party members in parliament gave tacit support to monarchy reform movements by joining civil society activities and providing bail guarantees to detained activists. The Constitutional Court held that such actions showed an intent to subvert the monarchy, which is “significantly dangerous to the security of the state.”

Disbanding the Move Forward Party violates the rights of its members to freedom of expression, association, peaceful assembly, and democratic participation guaranteed under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which Thailand ratified in 1996, Human Rights Watch said.

Article 25 of the ICCPR ensures the right of citizens to participate in public affairs, to vote, and to run for public office in free elections. The United Nations Human Rights Committee, the body of independent experts who review state compliance with the covenant, has stated that article 25 protects the right to “join organizations and associations concerned with political and public affairs,” and that “political parties and membership in parties play a significant role in the conduct of public affairs.”

In February 2020, the Constitutional Court dissolved the Future Forward Party—predecessor of the Move Forward Party—on politically motivated allegations that the party took an illegal loan from its leader. The current case was the culmination of a lengthy process that essentially reversed the votes of over 14 million party supporters, more votes than for any other party in the 2023 election.

“Thailand’s constitutional system has shredded the democratic will of the Thai people by preventing the Move Forward Party from forming a government and then disbanding it,” Pearson said. “The Move Forward Party’s dissolution weakens checks and balances by the political opposition and derails Thailand’s effort to restore democratic rule.”

The court dismissed concerns from Thailand’s allies and UN agencies, stating that “each country has its own constitution, laws, and regulations in accordance with national context; foreign politicians and diplomats should be mindful of diplomatic manners when expressing their opinions.”

Thailand’s major allies—including the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, Australia, Japan, and South Korea—should publicly convey to the Thai government that this decision is inconsistent with Thailand’s bid for membership of the UN Human Rights Council for 2025-2027.

“The UN and concerned governments should denounce the Move Forward Party’s dissolution as a jarring setback for political pluralism in Thailand,” Pearson said.",HIGH,20240807T230000Z,Thai Election Commission,"Pita Limjaroenrat, Chaithawat Tulathon, Elaine Pearson",Move Forward Party,"Bangkok, Thailand",Public denouncement of the court's decision by international community,Treason for advocating reform of lèse-majesté law,Thailand,"Attempt to amend lèse-majesté law, historical military influence in politics"

Repression in Russia under Vladimir Putin… Where to even begin?

One thing’s for sure, it didn’t start with Russia’s full-scale, atrocity-ridden invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Respect for fundamental freedoms in Russia had been deteriorating for at least a decade before that. The war certainly accelerated it, however.

A new, 205-page report details wave after wave of repressive legislation and policies the government under Putin has adopted since 2020. The list of measures is long and multi-faceted, but they all essentially have the same purpose: to empower the Kremlin to suppress internal dissent and try to immobilize and eliminate activist groups.

Pick a fundamental freedom, and you can bet the authorities have attacked it, restricted it, or erased it altogether: freedom of expression, freedom of association, the right to peaceful assembly, on and on.

The Kremlin has also imposed on the public a tight set of social, historical, and political ideas. No public variations, no questions allowed. There is one accepted way to think and talk about LGBT people, for example: the Kremlin’s hateful way.

There is one accepted way to discuss World War Two, the Kremlin’s way, a vision that excludes criticism of the conduct of the Soviet Red Army, among other things, in their fight against Nazi Germany.

And there’s only one way to discuss the invasion of Ukraine: the Kremlin’s way. Don’t call it a war, or an invasion. Don’t call occupied areas occupied. And, of course, don’t mention Russian forces’ atrocities in Ukraine.

Independently minded discussion about a vast range of issues simply cannot take place openly. You have the freedom to repeat the propaganda and obey the authorities – which is, of course, no freedom at all.

We’re not talking here about some kind of “political correctness” in which a person might be socially marginalized or “cancelled” if they say the wrong thing. Criminal and administrative penalties have become ever more severe, and hundreds of people have been imprisoned in Russia under these laws. Many dissenters, journalists, and activists have gone into exile.

If there’s a ray of light in this dark story it comes from the human rights defenders, activists, lawyers, independent groups, and media outlets that are persisting, even if in exile. As my colleague and expert Rachel Denber says, “They provide hope for the eventual transformation of Russia into a country committed to protecting fundamental rights.”",VERY HIGH,20240807T144500Z,"Human rights defenders, activists, journalists","Vladimir Putin, Rachel Denber",The Kremlin and Russian government,Russia,"Support for human rights defenders, condemnation of repressive laws",Suppression of fundamental freedoms and internal dissent,Russia,"Authoritarianism, desire to eliminate dissent"

Prime Minister K. P. Sharma Oli

Singhadurbar, Kathmandu, Nepal

Via email: info@nepal.gov.np

Re: Human Rights Agenda for the New Government

Dear Prime Minister Oli,

Congratulations on becoming prime minister. We are writing to draw your attention to some of the many urgent human rights challenges facing Nepal and urge you to create a legacy of positive change.

Human Rights Watch is an independent non-governmental organization that works in over 90 countries around the world, including the United States, India, and China. We have worked on human rights in Nepal for several decades, on issues ranging from abuses by all sides during the armed conflict, to LGBT rights, child marriage, and the protection of people with disabilities.

In particular, we wanted to draw your attention to the following issues:

Expanding the Child Grant:

In 2009-10, Nepal introduced a Child Grant program to support families in selected districts, with plans to extend it throughout the country. However, despite the policy’s success and popularity where it is available, this human right was not extended in recent budgets. The program currently provides monthly payments of Rs. 532 to families with children under the age of five in 25 out of Nepal’s 77 districts, and all Dalit children under five across the country.

Studies underscore the transformative impact of the Child Grant, including increased birth registration rates, improved access to food and clothes, and lower likelihood of child labor for the recipients and their siblings. Research also shows that the program is a popular policy, enhancing public perceptions of the government.

Around 40 percent of Nepal’s population is under 18, but children receive only around 4 percent of the government’s social protection budget. Nepal’s Child Grant is a proven social protection program for children, but in 2022 it covered just 9.5 percent of all children. The absence of social protection further exposes many children to the harmful effects of economic and climate-related shocks and unpredictable crises like the Covid-19 pandemic, which drove many families into poverty and children into child labor.

The Child Grant has been endorsed by numerous Nepali civil society organizations and international policy experts including UNICEF, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the European Union. In April 2023, 16 Nepali and international civil society organizations wrote to Nepal’s finance minister urging an expansion of the Child Grant. But successive governments have not followed through on commitments to roll it out nationwide.

It was encouraging earlier this year when the then Minister for Women, Children and Senior Citizens, Bhagawati Chaudhary, said the then government intended to extend the program to all districts. She also said the grant amount should be increased, as the current monthly payment is insufficient. But the recent budget did not include this proposal.

Nepal became a pioneer of social protection in South Asia by introducing a universal old age allowance in the 1990s. The Nepali government’s extension of the Child Grant would be an important step toward a more equitable future and another example of forward-looking policy to countries around the world.

We urge your government to:

Announce concrete steps to extend the Child Grant to all districts, and increase the monthly payment, with the ultimate goal of providing an adequate monthly amount to all Nepali families with children.

Delivering a Credible Transitional Justice Process:

In October 2023, UN Secretary-General António Guterres noted that Nepal is closer than it has ever been to beginning a meaningful transitional justice process, and pledged UN assistance. Ensuring justice and accountability remains the major outstanding commitment of the 2006 peace agreement that ended the decade-long civil war.

Many survivors of sexual violence, who have faced severe social stigma, were unable to register their cases when conflict-era human rights violations were being recorded by the government between 2016-2018. Unlike the victims of some other crimes, survivors of sexual violence and torture and ill treatment never received financial “interim relief,” although many suffer from lasting physical and psychological injuries.

The draft transitional justice bill currently before parliament contains some good provisions. It guarantees the right to reparation, as well as interim relief for some victims who were left out of earlier relief packages. It guarantees the right of the families of victims of enforced disappearance to their relatives’ property. It also mandates the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to study the root causes and impact of the conflict and recommend institutional reforms.

However, it still needs significant amendments if it is to meet standards set by Nepal’s Supreme Court, and clearly established in international law, as well as victims’ justice needs. As your government proceeds with the transitional justice process, it is important that you consider the five pillars of transitional justice identified by the UN Special Rapporteur: truth, justice, reparation, memorialization, and guarantees of non-recurrence.

A process that is not widely acknowledged as lawful and credible would not only fail victims but will not effectively conclude the peace process, because without justice it will not have legitimacy under Nepali or international law.

Under the bill as it currently stands, some gross violations of human rights amounting to crimes under national and international law may be placed outside the scope of prosecution. Cases classified as “serious violations of human rights” could be referred to and prosecuted in a special court. In a separate category, the bill defines “any acts against the domestic law, international human rights law or humanitarian law” as rights violations that cannot be referred to the special court. This risks providing de facto amnesties to alleged perpetrators of some serious international crimes, contrary to international law and the rulings of Nepal’s Supreme Court.

In addition, the definition of both “serious” violations and other violations of human rights stipulates that the offence was committed “in a targeted or planned manner against an unarmed individual or community.” This could exclude many cases not only from any criminal accountability but also other measures under the bill, such as reparations.

The bill does not ensure the independent appointment of judges to the special court, nor the selection of qualified personnel to handle the complexities of serious crime investigations and prosecutions. Finally, the bill does not provide for the financial independence of the transitional justice bodies. According to a recent report by the UN special rapporteur on transitional justice, transparent funding that provides sufficient material and human resources is key to guaranteeing the independence of transitional justice mechanisms.

On May 19, 2023, the Parliamentary Committee on Law, Justice and Human Rights formed an 11-member sub-committee to propose amendments to the bill. Several of the sub-committee’s reported proposals, if they are adopted, would help to address some of the shortcomings in the draft bill. However, the proposed amendments do not fully address several important issues, and we are particularly concerned by reports that some matters under negotiation could undermine the process.

We are aware that political negotiations are well advanced, and urge you to complete an agreement, after discussion with stakeholders, that can be the foundation of a credible and successful process.

We urge your government to:

Amend the transitional justice bill to ensure that all conduct amounting to gross violations of human rights and grave international crimes, including summary and arbitrary killings, torture, all war crimes and crimes against humanity , are brought to the jurisdiction of the Special Court and are not subject to amnesties.

and , are brought to the jurisdiction of the Special Court and are not subject to amnesties. Amend the transitional justice bill to ensure that the definition of victims of any rights violation is not limited to “unarmed civilians.”

Allow adequate time for those victims, including survivors of sexual violence, who have not filed a complaint to register their complaint.

Create a specialist unit within the TRC to handle cases of sexual violence and other forms of gender-based violence.

Ensure the bill provides for financial and administrative independence from the government for the commissions, and that the commissions can access additional resources if and when required.

Invite the UN to establish a small independent structure to be responsible for donor funds in support of transitional justice, to prevent politicization of transitional justice bodies.

Ensure that the bill provides for the independent appointment of judges to the Special Court, consistent with the standards in Nepal’s constitution.

Ensure any provisions on sentencing before the Special Court provide that the court can ensure sentences that are commensurate with the gravity of the crime and the degree of responsibility of the convicted person.

Having adopted the necessary amendments, present the bill for passage by parliament without further unnecessary delay.

Upholding the Rule of Law:

The lack of accountability for conflict-era abuses has helped to entrench a culture of impunity in post-conflict Nepal. This has weakened the rule of law.

Numerous instances of custodial torture and deaths, alleged extra-judicial executions by the police, and deaths resulting from the unnecessary use of lethal force against protestors have gone uninvestigated and unpunished in recent years. Frequently, victims or their families are offered compensation, but no action is taken against alleged perpetrators, and no reforms are made to institutions responsible for repeated abuses.

In July 2023, the then government proposed new legislation that would allow the government to withdraw criminal cases against political leaders and party activists if they were of a “political nature.” In perhaps the most recent instance of impunity, on July 24, 2024, Badshah Kurmi was sworn in as a provincial minister in Lumbini Province. On October 19, 2021, a committee appointed by the Home Ministry had recommended he be investigated for the suspected 2020 murder of Nirmala Kurmi.

In 2020, the National Human Rights Commission published 20 years of data, naming 286 people as suspects in serious crimes that authorities had failed to prosecute. The government has failed to initiate prosecution in any of these cases.

We urge your government to:

Actively seek to investigate and, where supported by evidence, prosecute police officers, as well as other officials, implicated in abuses.

Not to adopt legislation that would entrench impunity for politically connected people accused of crimes.

Abolish the statute of limitations in all rape cases. Although it was extended in 2022 from one year to either two or three years depending on the age of the victim, the existence of a state of limitations remains a barrier to justice.

Protecting the Rights of Migrant Workers:

Remittances from migrant workers are essential to the Nepali economy and allow millions of workers to support their families. Despite their contributions, many Nepali workers abroad suffer injury or death due to unsafe working conditions, while countless others are vulnerable to exploitation. The high cost of migration drives many into debt. We remain particularly concerned about Nepalis trafficked to serve in the Russian army.

We urge your government to:

Prioritize revising existing or signing new bilateral labor agreements that include strong provisions on responsible recruitment, wage protection, access to healthcare, occupational health and safety, and access to justice, with an emphasis on better monitoring and enforcement mechanisms.

Ensure that Nepali embassies in migrant destination countries are well-resourced to cater to the migrant workforce and enhance accountability among embassy staff to support migrant workers who experience abuse abroad.

Strengthen diplomatic efforts to ensure the immediate release of Bipin Joshi, a Learn and Earn student in Kibbutz Alumim in Israel, who has been held hostage in Gaza since October 7.

Take immediate steps to ensure the safe return of Nepalis fighting for the Russian Army in Ukraine, ensure compensation for the families of the deceased, and investigate and prosecute the traffickers involved in their deployment.

Unilaterally through pre-departure orientation or awareness programs, bilaterally in coordination with the governments of migrant destination countries, and regionally through platforms like the Colombo Process and Abu Dhabi Dialogue, raise issues around migrant worker health.

Lift the deployment ban on domestic workers’ emigration which has spurred irregular travel of aspirants to work in this sector which puts them further at risk. Instead, strengthen protection measures for workers in this sector in coordination with the destination country governments.

Establishing Clear Policies for Gender and Sexual Minorities:



Nepal has developed ground-breaking policies to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people since 2007, for which the government has received praise from many quarters. On June 28, 2023, the Supreme Court ordered the government to register same-sex marriages under an interim order. In another key ruling, the Supreme Court has ruled in July that a person should be allowed to change their gender from the one assigned at birth on the basis of self-identification, including changing to being listed as male or female—not just third gender.

However, implementation gaps persist. Strong legislation is needed to protect transgender people. Despite several Supreme Court orders to allow transgender people in Nepal to change their legal name and gender on the basis of self-identification, officials are increasingly asking for “medical proof” that a person has undergone surgery. This medical verification process is neither mentioned in Nepal’s laws nor is it in line with international best practices.

We urge your government to:

Prepare legislation recognizing same sex marriage.

Ensure that in the proposed new citizenship act, there is no mention of medical requirements for transgender Nepalis to change their legal name and gender on their nagarikta.

The Ministry of Home Affairs should work with civil society groups to create a transparent and quick procedure for processing paperwork related to legal gender change.

Respecting the Full Citizenship Rights of all Nepalis:

Due to flawed citizenship laws, an estimated 6.7 million people are forced to live without citizenship and are at risk of statelessness. In particular, Nepal’s 2006 Citizenship Act, as well as the 2015 constitution, contain provisions that discriminate against women by making it harder for them to pass Nepali citizenship to their children than for men. A citizenship bill, which was passed by parliament last year, provides citizenship to some people who did not have it, though it retains discriminatory provisions and leaves many others without citizenship.

Your government should bring legislation to ensure that all Nepalis enjoy equal and full citizenship rights regardless of gender, caste, or ethnicity.

We look forward to working with your government on these issues.



Yours sincerely,



Elaine Pearson

(London) – Nepal’s new government should seize opportunities for progress on human rights, including transitional justice and social security, Human Rights Watch said in a letter to Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli on August 6, 2024. The government should also act to protect the rights of migrant workers and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people.

Oli became prime minister for the third time on July 15, following a new coalition agreement between his Unified Marxist Leninist party and the Nepali Congress party. The new government has continued negotiations started by its predecessors to pass legislation that would establish a transitional justice process to address serious abuses committed during the 1996-2006 civil war.

“Nepal’s political leaders have made progress toward a credible transitional justice process, but success depends on legislation that meets standards set by Nepal’s Supreme Court and international law,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The government should agree on amendments to address shortcomings in the transitional justice bill, then present it for passage in parliament without further delay.”

In October 2023, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres noted that Nepal is closer than it has ever been to beginning a meaningful transitional justice process and pledged UN assistance.

The transitional justice bill contains provisions guaranteeing the right to reparations and the right of families of enforced disappearance victims to their relatives’ property. It mandates the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to study the root causes and impact of the conflict and to recommend institutional reforms. However, the bill still needs significant revisions if it is to ensure victims’ right to justice.

A recent report by the UN special rapporteur on transitional justice stated that allocating sufficient resources is key to guaranteeing the independence of transitional justice mechanisms. Donor funding should be managed in an accountable manner that upholds the independence of future transitional justice bodies, Human Rights Watch said.

Nepal has made significant achievements in protecting people’s right to social security, including through the Child Grant program, which has led to increased birth registration, improved access to food, and a lower likelihood of child labor for the recipients and their siblings. Research shows that the popular Child Grant program increases public support for the government.

However, while about 40 percent of Nepal’s population is under 18, children receive only about 4 percent of the government’s social protection budget. The Child Grant has been endorsed by numerous Nepali civil society organizations and international policy experts, including UNICEF, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the European Union, but is currently only available to 9.5 percent of Nepali children. Successive governments have not followed through on commitments to roll the program out nationwide. In April 2023, 16 Nepali and international civil society organizations wrote to Nepal’s finance minister urging expansion of the Child Grant program.

The Nepali government should adopt concrete measures to extend the Child Grant to all districts and increase the monthly payment to meet the ultimate goal of providing an adequate monthly income to all Nepali families with children, Human Rights Watch said.

The government should also act to protect Nepali migrant workers through bilateral labor agreements with destination countries that include strong provisions on responsible recruitment, wage protection, access to health care, occupational health and safety, and access to justice. Human Rights Watch also urged the government to ensure that Nepal’s embassies in migrant destination countries have sufficient resources to support workers who experience abuse.

Nepal is widely recognized for its achievements in advancing LGBT rights, particularly through a series of landmark Supreme Court decisions. However, the authorities have failed to properly carry out the rulings, in part due to a lack of comprehensive legislation. The government should bring legislation before parliament recognizing marriage equality. It should also issue a directive that transgender Nepalis can change their legal name and gender to male, female, or other without having to submit to medical verification.

“Prime Minister Oli has an opportunity to seize the moment and make important achievements on key rights issues, but the government will need to make sustained efforts and work closely with victims’ groups, rights organizations, and other partners,” Ganguly said. “Donor governments and the UN should stand ready with robust and adequate plans to support a Nepali-led process.”",HIGH,20240809T040000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli, Meenakshi Ganguly",Nepalese Government,Nepal,"Adopt transitional justice measures, expand social security programs, protect migrant workers' rights, enforce LGBT rights legislative changes","Failure to adequately address human rights issues, including transitional justice and protection of marginalized communities",Nepal,"Historical abuses during the civil war (1996-2006), inadequate social protections for children"

The UK has been rocked by far-right riots this week. Racist mobs have targeted mosques and asylum seeker accommodation, Muslims and people of color have been attacked, and police have been injured. In Rotherham, South Yorkshire, asylum seekers were trapped in their accommodation as rioters smashed windows and set the building on fire.

The riots are being fueled by racist and Islamophobic misinformation shared online, which should focus policymakers’ minds on how easily social media platforms can be harnessed to promote hate. The misguided and ignorant interventions of X, formerly known as Twitter, owner Elon Musk should also raise serious questions about how these platforms are managed, with parliamentarians suggesting Musk be called in to answer questions.

It is understandable many people in the UK are angry and frustrated that their living standards continue to decline and that they feel neglected or forgotten as local facilities close, benefits are cut, and funding to services is slashed. This disillusionment is being exploited by often racist extremists, who pretend there are simple “answers” to complex problems. Migrants, Muslims, and ethnic minorities have become scapegoats for all manner of policy failures, from the decline of the NHS to the availability of housing or jobs. In almost every instance, these claims are demonstrably false.

Politicians like Suella Braverman and Nigel Farage, and their dangerous anti-migrant and Islamophobic rhetoric, undoubtedly share some responsibility for laying the groundwork for the violence currently unfolding on Britain’s streets, and indeed Farage is accused of stoking the conspiracy theories that fueled this outbreak of violence. Even in the midst of this situation, Conservative leadership hopeful Robert Jenrick made Islamophobic comments that risk fanning the flames. By adopting the rhetoric of the far right, politicians have sanitized and mainstreamed Islamophobia and xenophobia, emboldening extremists. The willingness, indeed eagerness, of some media to vilify and demonize certain communities and groups has also made this possible. When the government conducts a postmortem of the riots, it should not ignore the role politicians and media played in stoking fear, mistrust, and hostility towards these groups.

The new Labour government inherits a country divided, in which the far right is a real and present danger. But to focus solely on the violent disorder is to treat the symptom of a much broader problem. To tackle the threat posed by the far right, the government needs not only to hold to account those spewing dehumanizing rhetoric and address ongoing structural racism and Islamophobia, but also begin to address the many and varied structural issues, including rising inequality and poverty, that are ripe for cynical exploitation to push a xenophobic agenda",HIGH,20240808T234500Z,Human rights advocates,"Elon Musk, Suella Braverman, Nigel Farage, Robert Jenrick","Far-right activists, political leaders, media","Sunderland, Rotherham, South Yorkshire","Address structural issues, hold politicians accountable, combat misinformation","Racism, Islamophobia, incitement of violence",United Kingdom,"Rising inequality, misinformation, political rhetoric"

On July 26, a court in Kazakhstan’s capital, Astana, sentenced 31-year-old Alexandr Merkul, a stand-up comedian, to 10-days detention on charges of “petty hooliganism” allegedly for using obscene language during a performance in June. It’s yet another instance of the extent of Kazakh authorities’ crackdown on freedom of expression.

Merkul, who pleaded guilty, often touches on social issues during his performances. For example, at the June concert he made a joke that “Kazakhstan is new, poverty is old,” presumably referring to “Zhana Kazakhstan,” a slogan that translates to “New Kazakhstan” and is used regularly by President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. On this occasion, rather than mere laughter, it seems to have provoked the authorities to respond by prosecuting him for “obscene” words used elsewhere in his act.

March 2023 amendments to Kazakhstan’s administrative code toughened penalties for the use of obscene language in public.

In a May interview on a Kazakh podcast, Merkul remarked that, “it is a bad situation when a comedian [or someone else] is jailed for their words.” Commenting on neighboring Russia’s use of laws to target critical comedians and artists, he reflected that when he writes his scripts, he doesn’t think about [the Kazakh authorities] targeting him. He added that “social and politically important issues” can be best addressed through a good comedian.

Merkul is not the only comedian Kazakh authorities have targeted for hooliganism. In May, an Almaty court sentenced another stand-up comic, Nuraskhan Baskozhayev, to 15 days in detention for swearing in public. Baskozhayev, who also pleaded guilty, had joked about corruption in Kazakhstan and made a comment about massive flooding in the country’s north earlier this year that caused the displacement of at least 120,000 people.

Targeting comedians appears to be part of a wider crackdown on free speech in Kazakhstan. On August 2, a court sentenced Duman Mukhammedkarim, a journalist and activist held in pretrial detention since June 2023, to seven years in prison on charges of “financing extremist activities” and “participating in the activities of a banned extremist organization.” He repeatedly criticized the government in his work.

People in Kazakhstan should be able to express critical opinions and commentary, not least through satire, without fear of retribution. Freedom of expression is not absolute, but international human rights law sets clear boundaries on legitimate government measures to regulate it.

Update: On August 10 at 9:30 p.m. in Türkiye, the Turkish authorities restored access to the Instagram platform, with the transport and infrastructure minister announcing that an agreement with Meta had been reached. The exact reasons for the decision to block the platform and the decision to reverse it remain unclear.

(London, August 9, 2024) – The Turkish authorities’ arbitrary decision on August 2, 2024, to impose a blanket block on access to Instagram violates the rights to freedom of expression and of access to information for millions of users, Human Rights Watch and the Freedom of Expression Association (İfade Özgürlüğü Derneği, İFÖD) said today. The block also interferes with small business owners in Türkiye who depend on the platform for their work.

Türkiye’s government-controlled internet regulator, the Information and Communication Technologies Authority (Bilgi Teknolojileri ve İletişim Kurumu, BTK), has not published the decision laying out the grounds for blocking access to Instagram. However the move came two days after President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s communications director accused Instagram’s parent company, Meta, of removing condolence messages relating to the former head of Hamas’ political bureau, Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Iran on July 31.

“Blocking everyone’s access to an entire social media platform is a grossly disproportionate measure that violates the right to free expression and information of millions of users of the platform in Türkiye and should be reversed immediately,” said Deborah Brown, technology and rights deputy director at Human Rights Watch. “A government’s disagreement over certain decisions either to take down or to permit certain content on a platform should never be used as a pretext to block access to the platform in its entirety.”

Public officials have issued contradictory messages about the ban, with some claiming that the decision was due to the platform’s failure to comply with requests to remove alleged criminal content. Without an official explanation, millions of users in Türkiye are left in the dark about why the decision was made. The Turkish government should ensure access is immediately restored, Human Rights Watch and the Freedom of Expression Association said.

Social media platforms should uphold freedom of expression and the right to information of their users by taking bold steps to challenge government decisions to block their platforms and by making public announcements informing the public of the measures they will take to protect their users’ rights in response to arbitrary blocking decisions.

Social media is one of the last arenas where people have access to independent news and can express themselves with relative freedom after the broad crackdown on media in Türkiye in recent years. This is despite Türkiye’s restrictive internet law, which gives the authorities the power to arbitrarily block and remove websites and other online content. Turkish officials have previously used this authority to block entire platforms.

Türkiye has previously blocked access in the country to Twitter, YouTube, Wikipedia, Google Sites (a wiki and web page creation tool created by Google), and Wordpress platforms. In July and August, the authorities also blocked access to the popular Wattpad and Roblox platforms.

Turkish officials have indefinitely blocked the Deutsche Welle and Voice of America news platforms in the country since June 2022. The Freedom of Expression Association’s EngelliWeb project announced that as of the end of March, Türkiye had blocked over one million websites.

In decisions relating to Google Sites, YouTube, Twitter, and Wikipedia, the European Court of Human Rights and Türkiye’s own Constitutional Court have found violations of freedom of expression and of the right of the public to receive information as well as impart it.

Under international law, governments have an obligation to ensure that any restrictions to information online are provided for in law, are a necessary and proportionate response to a specific threat, and are in the public interest.

“Blocking access to the Instagram platform is not only disproportionate but also arbitrary, as the details of the decision by Türkiye’s internet regulator have not been revealed and the blocking order was issued without a court order,” said Dr. Yaman Akdeniz, one of the co-founders of the Freedom of Expression Association (İFÖD). “This clearly violates freedom of expression and access to information but also breaches the constitutional obligation to guarantee an effective remedy through a court of law.”",HIGH,20240809T040000Z,Human Rights Watch and the Freedom of Expression Association,"President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Deborah Brown, Dr. Yaman Akdeniz",Turkish authorities,Türkiye,Immediate restoration of access to platforms; social media to challenge government decisions,"Arbitrary blocking of Instagram access, violating freedom of expression and access to information",Türkiye,Government disagreement with Meta over content; crackdown on media in Türkiye

The 36-year-old father of three, a Palestinian Medical Relief Society paramedic and ambulance driver, had been dispatched to the Tel al-Hawa neighborhood of Gaza City to rescue four wounded men. When his ambulance reached the Barcelona Garden, twenty meters from the Labor Ministry building, on Mughrabi Street, he saw four men surrounded by Israeli forces.

“I saw the four men being executed in cold blood,” Khalili said. “I saw it with my own eyes, I was three meters away. When they were shot, I hid under the ambulance, and next to it there was a building, so then I ran inside the building. The Israeli forces raided the building and started yelling at me to raise my hands.” Soldiers kicked and beat him with their rifle butts, breaking his ribs.

Human Rights Watch could not independently verify Khalili’s account of the killings. But his subsequent ordeal – including deportation from Gaza to detention facilities in Israel, torture, and denial of medical care – are consistent with the abuses in Israeli detention described by seven other healthcare workers we interviewed. His account is also consistent with reports by other rights groups, the United Nations human rights office, and journalists.

The soldiers forced Khalili to strip naked in public, zip-tied his hands behind his back, blindfolded him, took him to another location. “They kept telling me, ‘Say you’re Hamas,’” he said. He recalled the bitter November cold. Soldiers then placed him in an open-back military vehicle, hit him, and drove him to an open area, where he was forced to lie face-down on sandy ground. Soldiers repeatedly shoved his face into the sand with their boots and threatened to kill him, Khalili said.

One soldier pushed the muzzle of an assault rifle to his head, another doused him with gasoline, threatening to set him on fire, and others drove a military vehicle quickly toward him as if to run him over – a tactic that another former detainee separately described to us – apparently to terrify him into confessing to being a member of Hamas.

Israeli soldiers then transferred Khalili to Sde Teiman military base in southern Israel, northwest of the city of Beer Sheva, about 30 kilometers from Gaza. He said that at the detention facility, Israeli soldiers dragged him on the ground, removed the cuffs on his ankles, dressed him in adult diapers, and removed his blindfold. He saw he was in a large building “like a warehouse,” with chains hanging from the ceiling. Dozens of detainees, also in diapers, were suspended from the ceiling, with the chains attached to their square metal handcuffs.

He said that personnel at the facility then suspended him from a chain, so his feet were not touching the ground, dressed him in a garment and a headband that were attached to wires, and shocked him with electricity. He said:

The world was spinning around, and I fainted. They hit me with batons. I kept fainting and hallucinating. He kept asking me about the hostages, and moving Hamas hostages, and where I was on October 7. With every question I was electro-shocked to wake me up. He told me confess and we will stop torturing you.

Khalili said he was given electric shocks every second day in addition to being suspended in stress positions and having cold water thrown on him.

Khalili said that at three-day intervals, he was taken from the “warehouse” for interrogation. Before each interrogation, a soldier administered an unknown drug to him in pill form. “The pill made me feel weird, it was the first time I have felt like this, as if my inner mind was speaking what was in my heart, not me. I felt like I’m flying. I saw hallucinations.” An Israeli official whom Khalili said spoke fluent, unaccented Arabic interrogated him, focusing on the hostages taken to Gaza. The official “told me how many children I have, all their names, my address,” Khalili said, and threatened they would be killed if he did not confess.

Despite his broken ribs, Khalili said he received no medical treatment at Sde Teiman. Another detainee “had his leg amputated,” apparently as a result of prolonged shackling and exposure to cold. He said he saw a detainee in the “warehouse” experience what he believes was cardiac arrest; a soldier brought in an Israeli medical worker who confirmed the detainee was dead. Israeli forces brought the dead body of another detainee into the warehouse, Khalili said. Prayer was prohibited.

After 20 days, Israeli forces transferred Khalili, alone, in a wheelchair and unable to stand, from Sde Teiman to a detention facility he called “al-Naqab” prison. He was cuffed and blindfolded, and said soldiers threatened him with rape while he was being transported. Upon arrival at al-Naqab, officials at the facility “took my fingerprints and gave me a number” to identify him. After a few days, he was given clothes. Another detainee, tasked to act as a translator and go-between by Israeli guards, was allowed to bring him food. He was questioned three more times but not physically tortured.

The other detainees at al-Naqab were also sick and wounded, and a man who was visibly “bleeding from his bottom” was brought in and placed next to Khalili. The man told Khalili that before he was placed in detention, “three soldiers took turns raping him with an M16 [assault rifle]. No one else knew, but he told me as a paramedic. He was terrified. His mental health was awful, he started talking to himself.”

Khalili was given over-the-counter anti-inflammatory painkillers and antibiotics but no other medical help at al-Naqab, he said. Bright lights were never turned off at the facility, making it difficult to sleep. Detainees slept on thin mats on the ground, without pillows, cuffed and blindfolded. Breakfast was a piece of bread with cheese, tuna and tomato for lunch, and a piece of bread with jam for dinner, he said.

After more than 30 days at al-Naqab, Khalili said, he signed release papers at the prosecutors’ office and was given back his Palestinian ID document, but not his phone or cash (the equivalent of US$1,250) taken from him during his arrest in Gaza. Four days later, in late December 2023, he was released without charge at the Kerem Shalom/Karam Abu Salem crossing bordering the Gaza Strip and Egypt. He had weighed 80 kilograms when arrested, and now weighed 60, he said.

Back in Gaza, the Red Crescent Society provided Khalili with medical care and transferred him to Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital in Rafah. The World Health Organization arranged for permission for him to be transferred for care to Egypt in May, but Israeli forces closed the Rafah border crossing on May 7.

When we were last in touch with him, Khalili was sheltering in the Mawasi area near Khan Yunis, and still awaiting possible transfer to Egypt for medical care, separated from his family who are in northern Gaza. “I cry every day without my family,” he said. “I’m alone in the south, I have no one. I swear I don’t need anything but to be with my family.” He has not yet met his youngest son, who was born in Gaza while he was in detention.

He still loses consciousness and feels “something in my head like microwaves, a loud sound,” and his hands cramp up, Khalili said. He finds it hard to sleep due to the pain from his broken ribs.

(Jerusalem) – Israeli forces have arbitrarily detained Palestinian healthcare workers in Gaza since hostilities began in October 2023, deported them to detention facilities in Israel, and allegedly tortured and ill-treated them, Human Rights Watch said today. The detention of healthcare workers in the context of the Israeli military’s repeated attacks on hospitals in Gaza has contributed to the catastrophic degradation of the besieged territory’s healthcare system.

Released doctors, nurses and paramedics described to Human Rights Watch their mistreatment in Israeli custody, including humiliation, beatings, forced stress positions, prolonged cuffing and blindfolding, and denial of medical care. They also reported torture, including rape and sexual abuse by Israeli forces, denial of medical care, and poor detention conditions for the general detainee population.

“The Israeli government’s mistreatment of Palestinian healthcare workers has continued in the shadows and needs to immediately stop,” said Balkees Jarrah, acting Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. “The torture and other ill-treatment of doctors, nurses, and paramedics should be thoroughly investigated and appropriately punished, including by the International Criminal Court (ICC).”

From March to June 2024, Human Rights Watch interviewed eight Palestinian healthcare workers who were taken by the Israeli military from Gaza between November and December 2023 and detained without charge for between seven days and five months. Six were detained at work following Israeli sieges of hospitals or during hospital evacuations that they said had been coordinated with the Israeli military. None of the healthcare workers said they were ever informed of the reason for their detention or charged with an offense. Human Rights Watch also spoke with seven people who witnessed Israeli soldiers detaining healthcare workers carrying out their duties.

Human Rights Watch sent a letter to the Israeli military and Israeli Prison Services with the preliminary findings on August 13 but has not received a response.

All the healthcare workers interviewed provided similar accounts of mistreatment in Israeli custody. After being in Gaza, they were deported to detention facilities in Israel, including the Sde Teiman military base in the Negev desert and Ashkelon prison, or, forcibly transferred to the Anatot military base near East Jerusalem and the Ofer detention facility, in the occupied West Bank. All said that they were stripped, beaten, and blindfolded and handcuffed, for many weeks on end, and pressured to confess to being members of the Hamas movement with various threats of indefinite detention, rape, and killing their families in Gaza.

A surgeon said he was “wearing scrubs and Crocs” when Israeli forces detained him during their siege of Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahia, Gaza, in December. “We were 50 healthcare workers, including nurses and doctors,” he said. “The soldier on the microphone ordered men and boys over 15 years old to evacuate the hospital.... When they took us out of the hospital, they told us to undress and stay in our underwear.”

One paramedic said that at the Sde Teiman detention facility he was suspended from a chain attached to handcuffs, electroshocked, denied medical care for broken ribs caused by beatings, and administered what he believed was a psychoactive drug before interrogations. “It was so degrading, it was unbelievable,” he said. “I was helping people as a paramedic, I never expected something like this.”

Healthcare workers also reported being punished in detention for moving or speaking, and collectively punished if other detainees spoke. “Sometimes if one spoke, they [soldiers] punished the whole warehouse [at Naqab prison], collectively,” one healthcare worker said.

The Gaza Health Ministry reported that Israeli forces have detained at least 310 Palestinian healthcare workers since October 7. Healthcare Workers Watch-Palestine, a nongovernmental organization, documented 259 detentions of healthcare workers and collected 31 accounts describing torture and other abuses by Israeli authorities, including the use of stress positions, deprivation of adequate food and water, threats of sexual violence and rape, and degrading treatment. Healthcare Workers Watch-Palestine helped Human Rights Watch interview released healthcare workers.

The prolonged arbitrary detention and mistreatment of healthcare workers has exacerbated the health crisis in Gaza, Human Rights Watch said. Since October, over 92,000 people in Gaza have been wounded, functional hospitals have fewer than 1,500 inpatient beds, and yet the Israeli authorities have allowed only 35 percent of nearly 14,000 people who requested medical evacuations to leave Gaza, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported on August 5.

The healthcare workers’ accounts are consistent with independent reports, including by the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR ) , the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA ) , Israeli news media, and rights groups, documenting dozens of detainee accounts of incommunicado detention, beatings, sexual violence, forced confessions, electrocution, and other torture and abuses of Palestinians in Israeli detention.

The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported on June 3 that the Israeli military was conducting criminal investigations into the deaths of 48 Palestinians in Israeli detention facilities since October 7. These include Dr. Adnan al-Bursh, a surgeon and head of orthopedics at al-Shifa Hospital, and Dr. Eyad al-Rantisi, the director of a women’s health center at Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahia.

Common article 3 to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, applicable to hostilities between Israel and the Palestinian armed groups, provides that “[p]ersons taking no active part in the hostilities … shall in all circumstances be treated humanely.” “Cruel treatment and torture” and “outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment” are prohibited at all times. Those wounded and sick “shall be … cared for.”

Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, applicable to occupied territories, prohibits individual forcible transfers within the occupied territory as well as deportations of civilians from occupied territory to the occupying power’s territory, regardless of the motive. Serious violations of Common article 3 and article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention committed with criminal intent are war crimes.

Human Rights Watch has found that Israeli authorities for decades have failed to provide credible accountability for torture and other abuses against Palestinian detainees. According to official Israeli statistics, between 2019 and 2022, 1,830 complaints of abuse were opened against Israeli Prison Services officers, with none resulting in a criminal conviction. Israeli authorities have not allowed independent humanitarian agencies access to Palestinian detainees since the start of hostilities.

Governments should support international justice efforts to address Israeli abuses against Palestinian detainees and hold those responsible to account. The United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and other countries should press Israel to end its abusive detention practices, which form one aspect of systematic oppression underlying Israeli authorities’ crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution against Palestinians.

The ICC is considering arrest warrant applications against senior Israeli officials for grave international crimes and should ensure that its investigation addresses abuses against Palestinian detainees. Israel’s allies should press the government to urgently allow independent monitoring of detention facilities.

“The torture of Palestinian healthcare workers is a window into the much larger issue of the Israeli government’s treatment of detainees generally,” Jarrah said. “Governments should publicly call on the Israeli authorities to release unlawfully detained healthcare workers and end the cruel mistreatment and nightmarish conditions for all detained Palestinians.”

Humiliation, Ill-treatment, and Torture

The healthcare workers interviewed all reported humiliation, ill-treatment, and torture, including being stripped and beaten, with prolonged painful stress positions, near-constant cuffing, and blindfolding. Some said they were threatened with sexual violence and by attack dogs.

Abuses During Deportation, Detention

All eight men reported being forced to strip publicly immediately after being taken into custody and remain kneeling for extended periods, exposed to the cold, and at various times throughout their detention. Photographs and videos that Israeli soldiers shared online and that Reuters verified show Palestinian detainees unclothed or in underwear. Publishing such images online is an outrage on personal dignity and posted sexualized images are a form of sexual violence, which are war crimes.

“We were forced to strip in the street and remain in our boxers, one by one,” said Osama Tashtash, 28, a doctor at the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahia who was arrested in early December at his home nearby. “For an hour and a half, we were on our knees.” He said that during that period, he and other detainees were exposed to danger from Israeli military operations in the area. He said shrapnel fell on them as Israeli soldiers threw grenades at nearby houses and set them on fire.

Dr. Khalid Hamoudeh, 34, was arrested on the morning of December 12 at Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahia. A photograph circulated late that evening by the Israeli broadcaster Channel 12 shows Dr. Hamoudeh shirtless alongside four other men he identified as fellow healthcare workers. The photograph shows the men standing in a row in front of an Israeli soldier holding a light panel, illuminating the detainees.

Dr. Hamoudeh said they were photographed, then designated for release or detention. Behind them the photograph shows hundreds of men sitting in a large pit with at least 18 Israeli soldiers guarding them. A detailed analysis by the investigative TechJournalist identified several detainees with their hands tied behind their back, including Dr. Hamoudeh.

The image, whose site was identified first by the open-source researcher FDov on X, formerly known as Twitter, and later confirmed by Human Rights Watch, was taken approximately half a kilometer northeast of the hospital. Dr. Hamoudeh said that about 50 healthcare workers sitting together separately from internally displaced people. He said he was told to undress and stay in his underwear and was then blindfolded.

The healthcare workers described beatings and physical abuse after being detained, including being punched, kicked with steel-toed boots, slapped, and beaten with assault-rifle butts by Israeli soldiers.

Eyad Abed, 50, a surgeon at the Indonesian Hospital who was detained during a coordinated evacuation of the hospital in November, said:

Every minute we were beaten. I mean all over the body, on sensitive areas between the legs, the chest, the back. We were kicked all over the body and the face. They used the front of their boots which had a metal tip, then their weapons. They had lighters: one soldier tried to burn me but burned the person next to me. I told them I’m a doctor, but they didn’t care.

Abed said that he had broken ribs and a broken tailbone as a result of the physical assault by Israeli soldiers during his arrest and detention, which two months later still had not healed.

An ambulance driver who asked not to be named said while he was being held with dozens of other men in large a metal “cage” near the Israel-Gaza border fence, he saw guards beat to death two men, one of whom he recognized, with metal bars.

The healthcare workers all described ill-treatment during their deportation from Gaza to detention facilities in Israel, including beatings, sitting in prolonged painful stress positions while blindfolded and cuffed by the hands and feet, being “stacked above each other like sheep,” pepper sprayed, and denied water.

Abuses in Detention Facilities

The healthcare workers said that Israeli authorities abused detainees at detention facilities inside Israel. Four said that when they arrived at detention facilities, the authorities forced them to wear adult diapers and denied them access to toilets.

The ambulance driver, who was detained for five months, was first transferred to a prison in Ashkelon, where guards interrogated him daily for a week, during which time they bound him in his underwear to a chair for between 10 and 15 hours a day in a room with a blasting air conditioner. He said he had been badly beaten and that sitting caused extreme pain in his spine. He said the authorities denied him access to a toilet, forcing him to urinate on himself, and refused to provide him any food or water. He was then transferred to the Ofer military detention facility in the Occupied West Bank, where at night, the guards threw cold water on him and on his mattress.

A paramedic, Walid Khalili, 36, said that when soldiers removed his blindfold at the Sde Teiman facility, he saw he was in a large building “like a warehouse,” with chains hanging from the ceiling. Dozens of detainees in diapers were suspended from the ceiling, with the chains attached to their square metal handcuffs. He said that personnel at the facility then suspended him from a chain, so his feet were not touching the ground, dressed him in a garment and a headband that were attached to wires, and shocked him with electricity.

Two doctors held at Sde Teiman said that other detainees came to them to seek care for wounds inflicted by Israeli authorities. When detainees “lifted their shirts, I saw signs of abuse and physical beatings,” one doctor said. The other said, “I saw [men] who had cigarette burns on their arms, it was very clear. One had a dog bite on his stomach.”

As punishment for moving or speaking, detainees would be forced to stand, sometimes for hours, with their cuffed hands held above their head or fixed to a fence, detainees said. Detainees could hear the screams of other detainees being beaten nearby. One said that after he asked a question, an Israeli officer forced his fingers through a chain-link fence, he “told me to shut up and not say a word,” and pressed downward on the detainee’s fingers for several minutes, causing severe pain until the detainee could no longer feel his fingers.

Three healthcare workers reported soldiers using military dogs to intimidate detainees. “They would threaten to shoot us and start loading their weapons,” one doctor said. “This felt like horror. They brought in military dogs. I screamed, that was the worst moment in my life, because I was still cuffed and blindfolded, not seeing where the dogs are coming from.” Another doctor said dogs were brought in late at night to wake and terrify detainees.

Threats and Acts of Sexual Abuse

Three healthcare workers said that Israeli authorities threatened them with sexual assault. Khader Abu Nada, 30, a nurse at Beit Hanoun hospital in northern Gaza, said that when he denied any Hamas affiliation during his first interrogation at a military base in Gaza, the commander threatened to rape him with an “electric stick.” When Abu Nada continued to deny any Hamas affiliation, soldiers beat him until he was bleeding from his nose, hands, and mouth.

Abu Nada said the commander then asked him where his mother was and threatened to bring her from the checkpoint where he was arrested and strip her in front of everyone. “When I heard this, I was psychologically broken. I felt humiliated,” he said. He said he was threatened with rape again prior to his release.

A detained paramedic who was transferred to al-Naqab prison after 20 days in Sde Teiman, said that a man who was visibly “bleeding from his bottom” was brought in and placed next to him. The man told the paramedic that before he was placed in detention, “three soldiers took turns raping him with an M16 [assault rifle]. No one else knew, but he told me as a paramedic. He was terrified.” In addition, a doctor said while he was detained in a military base, a detainee, “in his late 30s, crying hard … told me he was sexually assaulted during the strip search.”

Cruel, Inhuman, and Degrading Conditions

All the healthcare workers described horrific conditions in detention. Abed, the surgeon, said the food was “horrible” and inadequate, and that he lost 22 kilograms during a month and a half in detention. The bathrooms were “not even fit for animals.” The mattresses and blankets were thin, and the cold nights were “unbearable.” In the cells, water for toilets and for drinking was only available for one hour a day, with a “disgusting” stench emanating from the non-flushable toilets. “They gave us a bag for the garbage. We used to fill it with water and drink from it later. It smelled horrible but we had no choice,” Abed said.

For detainees’ meals at Sde Teiman, soldiers “emptied tuna cans into a garbage bag and gave it to me,” said Dr. Khalid Hamoudeh, whom soldiers ordered to distribute food to detainees. “One time I saw a soldier spit in the bag. Many [detainees] were starving and telling me they were hungry.” A nurse detained at Anatot said, “We got two meals [a day]. It was terrible food. I would just drink water, there were no fruits, not even apples. They gave us food just to survive the day.”

Khalili, the paramedic, said that at one point when he was detained in Sde Teiman, an Israeli news crew arrived, and a detainee who understood Hebrew told him that a prison official told the journalists, falsely, that the detainees were members of a unit of Hamas’s armed wing responsible for the October 7 attacks. The next day, the paramedic said, soldiers brought food and set it in front of the detainees, ordered them not to eat it, took photographs, then took the food away.

Prolonged Cuffing and Blindfolding

The healthcare workers said that they were cuffed almost constantly throughout their detention. They said Israeli authorities often ignored detainees who complained about the tightness of their cuffs or tightened their cuffs as punishment for complaining. In a public letter, an Israeli doctor working in the military field hospital at Sde Teiman wrote that in a single week, “two prisoners had their legs amputated due to handcuff injuries, which unfortunately is a routine event.”

Abu Nada, the nurse, said he was arrested at the Kuwaiti Roundabout in Gaza on November 22 while evacuating from the north with his family. Soldiers ordered him to strip, cuffed and blindfolded him, then took him for questioning. He said his first interrogation ended with an Israeli military commander punching him in the face and kicking him all over his body, then ordering another soldier to tighten his cuffs and drag him to an open field, where he waited on his knees for an hour.

“My wrists hurt so much, they felt paralyzed and numb. I cried so much, I couldn’t take the pain,” Abu Nada said. When he asked a soldier to loosen his cuffs, he said the soldier repeatedly kicked his head instead. “I told him, ‘Kill me I can’t take it anymore, kill me already.’” Israeli soldiers ignored or beat him in response to his multiple requests to loosen his handcuffs.

Abu Nada said his wrists later turned black, and he feared his mistreatment may have caused permanent damage: “I still feel pain in my hands. My hands are weak, and I have no strength to hold or carry anything. Also, there’s still pain from my shoulders all the way to my fingertips. I have severe neck pain from the pressure on my head when they kept pushing our heads down.”

As Physicians for Human Rights Israel has reported, prolonged physical restraint causes intense pain and can result in permanent nerve damage that interferes with using the hands and in extreme cases can lead to death.

The healthcare workers also all reported prolonged, near-constant blindfolding. According to Physicians for Human Rights Israel, “blindfolding can, even with short-term use, induce visual hallucinations in healthy individuals. Over extended periods, prolonged use of blindfolds can contribute to the onset of anxiety disorders, depression, substance abuse, and PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) in the medium to long term.”

Medical Neglect

The healthcare workers described medical neglect despite the detainees’ numerous requests and clear, urgent need for treatment for preexisting health conditions, or for injuries sustained during the hostilities in Gaza or from abuses in custody.

A nurse at Awda hospital in northern Gaza, who asked not to be named, said that on November 21 he was injured when an Israeli airstrike hit his hospital. He had emergency surgery at Awda hospital to stabilize broken fingers and a torn tendon in his right hand, which was then placed in a cast, and an open wound on his left hand was wrapped in gauze.

The next day, the nurse left the hospital in an ambulance along with 15 other people, including patients, their companions, and hospital staff, in an evacuation arranged by the Red Cross and Médecins Sans Frontieres (MSF or Doctors Without Borders). “The hospital shared our car license plate number, IDs, and names [with the Israeli military], and everything was approved,” he said.

Shortly after their departure, Israeli soldiers at the Kuwaiti Roundabout stopped the ambulance and ordered all passengers to exit. The nurse and another doctor were taken aside and ordered to strip. “My right hand had a cast and titanium [implants]; I couldn’t use it. I couldn’t even pee alone. The doctor detained with me helped me take off my clothes, even my shoes,” the nurse said.

Cuffed and blindfolded, the nurse was taken to Anatot military base. He said that on intake, soldiers introduced a man as a doctor who examined his wounds but did nothing else. He said despite repeated requests, the dressing was only changed for the first time on the third or fourth day of his detention and rarely after that. “They only changed the gauze on the injuries – no scans, no proper medication, nothing. My injury, the skin was open, [but I was given] nothing to treat possible bacteria,” he said. The nurse also said that after a week of detention he was released and needed surgery to treat hemorrhoids due to constant sitting and being kicked in detention.

Dr. Hamoudeh said that during his detention at Sde Teiman in late December, he saw another detainee with apparent “trauma from beatings, and I was terrified he would die.” He alerted authorities who said they were paramedics – he never saw an Israeli doctor at the facility – and “they took pictures [of the injuries] and sent it to someone. The soldier then told them enough, and not to do any more medical care.” He said when he told soldiers about people in need of medical care, they would reply to him saying they did not care if they died.

Dr. Hamoudeh said that one day in December, soldiers brought in five detained doctors, including Dr. Adnan al-Bursh, head of orthopedics at al-Shifa hospital in Gaza, who was declared dead by Israeli Prison authorities in Ofer prison in April. “Dr. Adnan was in pain from the beatings. He was also punished. He had visible blunt trauma, and he had trouble breathing,” Dr. Hamoudeh said. “What happened to him, happened to many. There’s clear medical neglect.”

Dr. Osama Tushtash, 28, fell ill with a severe fever after a week in detention at what he believed was al-Naqab prison, but Israeli authorities refused to let him see a doctor or even to give him a painkiller. “They just told me to drink water,” he said.

Khalili, the paramedic, said he suffered broken ribs and a lung injury as a result of beatings, but received no medical treatment at Sde Teiman. He said he saw a detainee die from what he believes was cardiac arrest. When a soldier brought in a doctor, who confirmed the detainee was dead, the detainees shouted “Allahu akbar,” prompting a violent raid by an Israeli special unit tasked with prison raids.

Autopsies of Palestinians who died in Israeli detention facilities indicated medical neglect and signs of physical abuse, including bruising and broken bones, Haaretz reported in March. A report released by Physicians for Human Rights Israel documented treatment without consent, surgery performed without an anesthesiologist, and political interference in medical decisions in detention facilities.

In a letter to senior Israeli officials, an Israeli doctor at Sde Teiman field hospital described practices that endangered detainees’ health, including the lack of trained medical staff, and transferring patients back to the detention facility after only an hour of observation following “major [surgical] operations,” Haaretz reported.

Article 91 of the Fourth Geneva Convention requires facilities detaining civilians to “have an adequate infirmary, under the direction of a qualified doctor,” where those detained may receive “the attention they require, as well as an appropriate diet.” Under international human rights law, medical care for detainees should be at least equivalent to that available to the general population. Current conditions of detention violate the Israeli Incarceration of Unlawful Combatants Law, which provides for detainees’ right to medical treatment, hygienic conditions, healthy and dignified sleeping arrangements, and daily outside exercise.

Use of Prisoner Functionaries

Two healthcare workers detained in different facilities said Israeli military commanders tasked them to act as prisoner functionaries or Shawish (an Arabic slang term for “servant” or “subordinate”). The men said that shawish, who act as intermediaries between the guards and detainees, are the only detainees not constantly blindfolded, though their hands remain cuffed. The men prepared and distributed food, assisted detainees with eating or using the toilet, cleaned rooms, transferred detainees to interrogation, and provided basic medical care.

Whistleblowers who spoke to CNN alleged that Israeli authorities appointed detainees as shawish only after they were cleared of suspected links to Hamas, and thus had no reason to detain them. In a statement to CNN, the Israeli military denied holding detainees unnecessarily.

Dr. Hamoudeh said that soldiers at Sde Teiman told him to act as a shawish because he spoke English, warning, “If you do anything, you’ll be punished worse than the rest.” He was interrogated only once, for about 10 minutes, on the tenth day of his detention, and was released without charge after 22 days.

Abu Nada, the nurse, said authorities at the Anatot military base told him to work as a shawish. On the fifth day of his detention, a soldier speaking in Arabic told him that if he wanted a lawyer, he had to provide the lawyer’s phone number, which he could not. He said the soldier told him, “We didn’t find anything on you. But we will continue investigating.” He was released without charge after about eight days, on December 1.

With his blindfold removed, Dr. Hamoudeh saw 10 to 20 detainees with medical conditions at Sde Teiman, some of whom needed immediate medical care. “They [the soldiers] threw this responsibility at me, but [left me] without proper medical equipment and facilities,” Hamoudeh said. “I was terrified some would die. […] The shawish before me told me [before being released] that three detainees died during his time.”

Abu Nada accompanied cuffed, blindfolded detainees from the “warehouse” to the interrogation room. “All the way to interrogation, soldiers would be kicking and assaulting [the detainees],” he said. “I used to cry when transferring them, because I’m the one bringing them to this torture. Soldiers told me to turn my face not to look as they continued to kick and beat the detainees.”",VERY HIGH,20240826T050000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Balkees Jarrah, Dr. Adnan al-Bursh, Dr. Khalid Hamoudeh",Israeli military,"Gaza and Israeli detention facilities (Sde Teiman military base, Ashkelon prison, Ofer detention facility)","End abusive detention practices, allow independent monitoring of detention facilities, hold accountable those responsible for abuses","Arbitrary detention, torture, and ill-treatment of Palestinian healthcare workers",Israel/Palestine,Israeli military operations in Gaza and systemic oppression of Palestinians

Imagine this. You just got out of prison. By the way, you didn’t do anything wrong to get there – you merely protested peacefully against the authorities – but they locked you up anyway. Now, you’re walking out the prison gates, finally free.

It’s time to get your life back in order. One of the first things you need to do is get some cash, so you hit an ATM. Your card doesn’t work. When you go into the bank to find out what the trouble is, they tell you your account’s been blocked. That’s how you learn you’re on the government’s “Financing Terrorism List.”

You thought you were finally free, but it turns out you’re not. Not really.

You can be in public, but you can’t interact with much of it. You are financially ostracized, cut out of the modern economy. You are forbidden from using credit cards and debit cards.

You are theoretically allowed to have a job, but what employer is going to want to hire someone on a government blacklist – especially since they would have to make special arrangements to pay you?

When you were sentenced – again, for the non-crime of peacefully protesting – there was nothing in the verdict about these restrictions. And when you try to find out more, you get the runaround. Sometimes, officials say they don’t even know what the list is about.

This is a Kafkaesque side to Kazakhstan: repression without rationality. The state bureaucracy punishes peaceful opposition activists, government critics, and others with unjustified, unclear, and unannounced restrictions. The politically targeted become economically isolated.

A core issue is that the law does not distinguish between violent and nonviolent extremism. So, authorities in Kazakhstan can misuse extremism and terrorism legislation to target peaceful dissenters and others. This is in violation of international human rights law.

Even people who have not participated in, instigated, or financed violence are automatically subject to the financial restrictions described here. This interferes with peoples’ economic and social rights.

The government needs to narrow its focus. It should change the law so that legislation related to extremism and terrorism is not misused, including against peaceful critics. It also needs to remove people convicted of nonviolent crimes from the list.

A few questions from Kazakhstan’s international partners could help here, too. The government of Kazakhstan cares about its global reputation, and Kafkaesque nightmares are not a good look.",HIGH,20240827T181500Z,Peaceful opposition activists and government critics,None specified,Kazakhstan government,Kazakhstan,"Change laws regarding extremism and terrorism, remove nonviolent offenders from blacklist",Financial ostracization of peaceful protesters through unjustified restrictions,Kazakhstan,Misuse of extremism and terrorism laws

Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus

Interim Government of Bangladesh

Dhaka, Bangladesh

Re: Rebuilding respect for human rights in Bangladesh



Dear Professor Muhammad Yunus,

I am writing to you and to the members of the interim government of Bangladesh on behalf of Human Rights Watch to offer our recommendations for a democratic and rights-respecting future. While you have undertaken leadership of the country at a time of great turmoil, divisiveness, and violence, it is also a historic opportunity to rebuild greater respect and protections for human rights.

Human Rights Watch is an international non-government organization that monitors and reports on human rights in over 100 countries worldwide. We have been following and reporting on Bangladesh for over two decades.

As you know, the violent crackdown on the protests leading to Sheikh Hasina’s resignation as prime minister was the deadliest in Bangladesh’s recent history. At least 440 people were killed and thousands were injured between July 15 and August 5. Law enforcement carried out a cordon-and-search operation, arresting nearly 10,000 people, and enforced a curfew with orders to shoot-on- sight. An 11-day internet blackout inhibited human rights monitors and journalists from documenting abuses precisely the time when people were most at risk.

When Sheikh Hasina fled the country, tens of thousands of Bangladeshis celebrated the end of her repressive rule. However, in some places, celebrations turned violent, with hundreds killed or injured as demonstrators engaged in reprisals against those perceived to have supported Hasina’s government. Thousands of minority Hindu people gathered at the border, seeking to enter India out of fear of further attacks.

In a short time, the interim government has publicly urged calm, acted to quell the violence, and committed to investigate and prosecute those responsible of excessive and indiscriminate use of force to crush the protests. We commend your immediate move to release all those arrested for participating in the protests and to drop all charges against them. We have also spoken with relatives of those forcibly disappeared during the previous government who were reunited with their loved ones and, in other cases, learned of their deaths.

We urge you to undertake the below actions to promote and protect human rights in the present, account for the grave abuses of the past, and build a rights-based foundation for the future, including by addressing the issues of impunity and economic inequality that protesters risked their lives to oppose.

The government should urgently:

Present, or support the adoption of, a resolution at the upcoming session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (HRC) that: Establishes a United Nations backed independent mechanism with a comprehensive mandate to investigate, collect, store, and analyse evidence and cooperate with credible and independent national and international bodies towards accountability in relation to the violent incidents of July and August 2024 and its root causes. The material scope of an investigation should encompass acts by all relevant actors, including but not limited to previous cases of enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and torture. Mandates the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to monitor the situation in Bangladesh through the transition period until there are free and fair elections, and report regularly to the HRC.

(HRC) that: Request technical support from OHCHR and facilitate visits by relevant special procedures of the HRC to establish an independent commission of inquiry on enforced disappearances in collaboration with victims and relatives of victims of enforced disappearances to investigate all existing allegations of enforced disappearances, regardless of whether the victim was arrested, returned alive, killed, or remains missing, with capacity for truth telling and reparations for violations prior to July 2024.

Given the absence of accountable and effective law enforcement, request technical support from the UN Office of Rule of Law and Security Institutions to ensure rights-based law enforcement, including attention to preventing and responding to attacks on minorities and acts of sexual and gender-based violence.

from the UN Office of Rule of Law and Security Institutions to ensure rights-based law enforcement, including attention to preventing and responding to attacks on minorities and acts of sexual and gender-based violence. Welcome the support of OHCHR to ensure the full independence of legal and judicial bodies, including an effective national human rights commission in line with the Paris Principles which can undertake robust vetting prior to deployment in UN peacekeeping.

Disband the Rapid Action Battalion , which was instrumental in carrying out grave abuses under the previous government and operates with near impunity, and investigate allegations of human rights violations by the unit since it was established.

Human Rights Watch Concerns and Recommendations for the Interim Government of Bangladesh

August 2024

Accounting for Past Abuses

The groundswell of public support for the student protesters, and willingness of individuals to put their lives on the line to protest autocratic rule, was a response to the gravity of abuses committed by the previous government over the last 15 years.

Enforced Disappearances and Extrajudicial Killings

According to Bangladeshi human rights monitors, security forces carried out over 600 enforced disappearances since 2009. While some people were later released, produced in court, or said to have died during armed exchanges with security forces, nearly 100 people remain “disappeared.” While there has been immense relief over the last week for those whose relatives were returned after Sheikh Hasina’s resignation, for many families the whereabouts of their loved ones remain unknown. Leaked information from military intelligence records indicates that some individuals who were forcibly disappeared were killed in custody. For victims who were returned and for those who are still missing, justice and accountability remains elusive.

Security forces have killed hundreds of people, including opposition members and activists, in “crossfire” incidents or “gunfights,” euphemisms for extrajudicial killings in which the authorities falsely claim that the suspect was shot during an armed exchange. In May 2018—six months before the general election—Sheikh Hasina announced a “war on drugs” to be led by the Rapid Action Battalion after a reported rise in methamphetamine sales and use. Under the guise of the war on drugs, law enforcement officers reportedly killed more than 450 people that year. Many of them targeted alleged drug traders and users, while activists allege that some killings also targeted and served to intimidate members of the opposition and to silence critics.

The previous government did not take up the offer from the UN to help establish a specialized mechanism to investigate allegations of enforced disappearances in line with international standards and ignored repeated requests from the UN Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances to visit the country. Instead, Bangladesh authorities harassed and intimidated victims’ families and denied that enforced disappearances occurred at all.

We commend the government for already meeting with representatives of Maayer Daak, the platform of families representing the families of the forcibly disappeared. The interim government should:

Locate and release those held illegally by security forces, including in secret detention sites.

Identify and demolish all secret prisons, including the infamous Aynaghar.

Establish an independent commission of inquiry on enforced disappearances in collaboration with the UN Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances to investigate all existing allegations of enforced disappearances, regardless of whether the victim was arrested, returned alive, killed, or remains missing. Ensure that this commission can recommend cases for prosecution to the attorney general’s office and create a credible special civilian court to hold accountable those found to have command responsibility in cases of disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and torture, and abuses against family members of disappeared people, including members of the military.

in cases of disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and torture, and abuses against family members of disappeared people, including members of the military. Facilitate a visit by the UN Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances and the UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions and seek their recommendations and advice for the creation of the above-described special UN-supported independent mechanism.

Work with Maayer Daak and other relatives of victims of enforced disappearance to establish a museum or other memorial to commemorate victims of enforced disappearances and the suffering of their families, and advocate against the commission of disappearances in the future.

to establish a museum or other memorial to commemorate victims of enforced disappearances and the suffering of their families, and advocate against the commission of disappearances in the future. Ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.

Torture and Other Ill-treatment

Despite serious allegations of torture by security forces under the previous government, these allegations were rarely investigated or prosecuted. Following a review in July 2019, the UN Committee against Torture described the Bangladesh police as a “state within a state,” asserting that “in general, one got the impression that the police, as well as other law enforcement agencies, were able to operate with impunity and zero accountability.” Only one case of torture resulted in convictions under Bangladesh’s Torture and Custodial Death (Prevention) Act since its passage a decade ago, according to media reports.

Bangladesh has ignored repeated requests from the UN Committee against Torture to follow up on its recommendations, as required, and repeated requests from the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment to conduct a country visit.

We urge the interim government to:

Facilitate a visit by the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment to allow them to investigate and make appropriate recommendations to ensure justice and accountability.

Establish an independent investigation mechanism to handle complaints regarding torture and ill-treatment, including sexual and gender-based violence, by law enforcement officials that is independent of law enforcement agencies and to monitor all detention sites.

Enact legislation and dedicate resources to an effective victim and witness protection system.

Building Independent Institutions

The grave abuses committed by the previous government were enabled by the slow destruction of the judiciary’s independence, the weakening of human rights institutions, and the passage of draconian legislation used to silence critics and provide immunity for abusive security forces.

(Geneva) – The Bangladesh interim government should seek a resolution at the upcoming session of the United Nations Human Rights Council to establish an independent mechanism to investigate and pursue accountability for recent grave abuses in Bangladesh, Human Rights Watch said in a letter to chief advisor Muhammad Yunus and other interim government officials that was released today. The council should also ensure ongoing monitoring of Bangladesh’s human rights situation by UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and establish regular reporting back to the council. The 57th session of the UN Human Rights Council begins on September 9, 2024.

The interim government should also work with OHCHR and relevant UN experts to set up an independent domestic inquiry into enforced disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial killings during former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s 15-year administration, Human Rights Watch said. This domestic mechanism should operate with UN support and oversight to ensure its independence and adherence to international human rights standards.

“Following Sheikh Hasina’s resignation amid mass protests, Bangladesh’s interim government has the heavy responsibility of accounting for the past to steer the country toward a rights-respecting future,” said Lucy McKernan, deputy UN Geneva director at Human Rights Watch. “The government should support a Human Rights Council-backed investigation into recent abuses while also seeking UN backing for an independent domestic inquiry into the former government’s 15 years of rights violations.”

The interim government should urgently implement measures to bring civilian oversight over security forces, disband the notorious Rapid Action Battalion, reform institutions in line with international human rights standards, and revise abusive laws.

The crackdown on protests leading to Sheikh Hasina’s departure was the deadliest in Bangladesh’s recent history. At least 440 people were killed and thousands were injured between July 15 and August 5, with most deaths and injuries attributed to excessive force by law enforcement and violence by student and youth groups affiliated with the Awami League, Sheikh Hasina’s political party. An estimated additional 250 people died after August 5, mostly in violent reprisals against Sheikh Hasina’s supporters.

Since taking office, the interim government has replaced officials who had allegedly engaged in political partisanship. The Supreme Court chief justice stepped down after protests demanding his resignation. Law enforcement had collapsed after the Hasina government’s fall, leaving Hindus and other minority communities at risk of violence, but the interim government has said that most police stations are now functioning. However, activists fear that the authorities are replicating the abuses of the previous government by arbitrarily arresting Awami League officials and supporters, including journalists, and denying due process and proper access to legal counsel.

The Yunus administration has publicly urged calm, acted to quell the violence, and committed to investigate and prosecute those responsible for unnecessary and excessive use of force to crush the protests. The interim government also swiftly released political prisoners detained during the protests, dropped charges against activists, committed to signing the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, and pledged to investigate the over 700 cases of enforced disappearances committed under Sheikh Hasina’s rule.

To effectively follow through on its commitments to justice and accountability amid a highly divisive political environment, the interim government should ask the Human Rights Council to establish an independent mechanism with a comprehensive mandate to investigate, collect, store, and analyze evidence and cooperate with credible and independent national and international judicial bodies toward accountability for the July and August violence and its root causes. A Human Rights Council-mandated investigation would have the greatest independence and credibility for Bangladeshis, who distrust domestic institutions and could avoid the political interference that could undermine purely domestic measures.

The council resolution should also mandate OHCHR to monitor the human rights situation in Bangladesh through the transition period until there are free and fair elections, and report back regularly.

The recent protests reflect the frustration that Bangladesh’s economic progress has been unevenly shared. Social protection should be reformed to guarantee an adequate level of protection for all, and to ensure that no one is excluded from public benefits because of their inability to pay bribes or because they lack social or political connections.

The interim government needs to reform institutions, the security sector, and its justice and legal system, all of which have been deeply eroded under the previous government and earlier administrations, to bring about lasting, human rights changes, Human Right Watch said. The interim government should welcome the technical assistance of OHCHR to ensure the full independence of legal and judicial bodies.

In addition to disbanding the Rapid Action Battalion, the interim government should implement robust human rights training protocols across all security forces and remove laws that enable impunity for security force abuse, Human Rights Watch said.

“Without deep institutional reform and UN support to ensure independence and transparency, the hard-won advancements in Bangladesh could be easily lost,” McKernan said. “The UN and member states should demonstrate their support for all Bangladeshis by backing fact-finding and accountability measures and by investing in rights-based institutional and security sector reform.”",VERY HIGH,20240827T041500Z,Human Rights Watch,"Muhammad Yunus (current chief advisor), Sheikh Hasina (former Prime Minister)",Former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government and current authorities,Bangladesh,"Establish independent inquiry, monitor human rights situation, institutional reform, disband Rapid Action Battalion, training for security forces.","Enforced disappearances, torture, extrajudicial killings and human rights violations during Hasina's rule and recent violent suppression of protests",Bangladesh,"Political repression, institutional erosion, socio-economic inequality"

The Sri Lankan government has been trying to persuade international partners of its achievements in reforming the economy and protecting human rights.

However, a new report by the United Nations high commissioner for human rights warns that Sri Lanka is facing renewed threats to fundamental freedoms. It finds that authorities have sought new repressive laws and engaged in intimidation and violence against victims of past abuses, civil society activists, journalists, and government critics.

The government denies responsibility for grave abuses during Sri Lanka’s 1983-2006 civil war. “This entrenched impunity has also manifested itself in the corruption, abuse of power and governance failures that were among the root causes of the country’s recent economic crisis,” the report says.

The economic crisis, which escalated in 2022, has doubled the poverty rate. The UN estimates that a quarter of households are suffering food insecurity, yet “democratic reforms and accountability for corruption and economic mismanagement remain largely unfulfilled.”

The report finds that “ill-treatment by police and security forces remain prevalent.” Between January 2023 and March 2024, the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka recorded 21 alleged extrajudicial killings, 26 deaths in custody, and 1,342 arbitrary arrests and detentions. The UN examined recent allegations of “abduction, arbitrary detention, torture, ill-treatment and sexual violence perpetrated against individuals of Tamil ethnicity by Sri Lankan security forces.”

Since ending a moratorium on the abusive Prevention of Terrorism Act in 2022, the government has used the law dozens of times against perceived critics, especially Tamils. The families of victims of enforced disappearance face reprisals for engaging with the UN or foreign diplomats. Authorities have detained 121,957 people in a brutal anti-drugs campaign, sending thousands to military-run “rehabilitation” centers.

Meanwhile, new laws “have profound implications for … fundamental freedoms and the rule of law,” the report says. The Online Safety Act contains powers to restrict freedom of expression, and proposed legislation curtailing nongovernment organizations would severely affect groups already suffering from “surveillance, intimidation and harassment.”

The high commissioner calls upon members of the UN Human Rights Council to renew UN mandates for monitoring and evidence collection and for “the international community ... to help break the cycle of systematic impunity… [by] using all potential forms of jurisdiction.” Human Rights Watch echoes this call and urges UN member states to ensure the Human Rights Council, at its upcoming September session, adopts a resolution renewing those mandates.",HIGH,20240827T043000Z,United Nations Human Rights Commission,President Rani Wickremesinghe,Sri Lankan Government,"Colombo, Sri Lanka","Renew UN mandates for monitoring and evidence collection, international community action to break cycle of impunity.","Repressive laws and violence against civil society activists, journalists, and government critics",Sri Lanka,"Corruption, abuse of power, governance failures, historical impunity"

Your excellencies:

I am writing, on behalf of Human Rights Watch, regarding the ongoing crisis in Venezuela.

As your excellencies known, on July 29, Venezuela’s National Electoral Council (Consejo Nacional Electoral, CNE) declared that Nicolás Maduro won the presidential election that took place the day before. To date, the CNE has not released the tally sheets from the election, nor conducted the electoral audits or citizen verification processes required by law.[1] The UN Electoral Technical Team and the Carter Center, which observed the elections, said the process lacked transparency and integrity and questioned the declared result.[2] Instead, they have granted credibility to the precinct-level tally sheets that the opposition has made public which indicate that Edmundo González won the election by a significant margin.[3]

Human Rights Watch has been documenting the government repression that followed the announcement of these electoral results. We have received credible reports that 23 protesters and bystanders, as well as one member of the Bolivarian National Guard, have been killed in the context of protests. Security forces have detained over 2,000 people, according to the government. The pro bono group of lawyers Foro Penal has verified over 1,500 cases, including roughly 130 children and 20 people with disabilities. Only 90 people have been reported to be released, while hundreds of others have been charged with “terrorism.”[4] In many ways, the current wave of arbitrary arrests in Venezuela appears to be unprecedented in the country’s recent history, surpassing on average the rates of arrests during the prolonged anti-government protests of 2014 and 2017.[5]

In this alarming context, we welcome efforts by governments in Latin America, Europe and the United States to ensure respect for the will of the people as expressed in the ballots on July 28, as well as to put an end to widespread human rights violations. We have followed, with great interest, the initiatives led by your governments to negotiate a solution to this crisis.

We continue to believe that a meaningful negotiation among all relevant stakeholders is the best way to protect human rights in Venezuela.[6] As your governments have noted, transparent and impartial verification of electoral results, dialogue and agreement-seeking efforts, and guarantees for all Venezuelans to participate in politics are likely to be key components of such a negotiated solution.[7] Other key components are likely to include targeted sanctions for members of the military responsible for human rights violations and related corruption, as well as incentives for Maduro’s international allies and the private sector operating in Venezuela so that these actors also promote respect for the electoral results and human rights.

We are, however, concerned about three specific proposals that your governments have made in recent weeks: (1) repeating the election; (2) relying on Venezuela’s Supreme Court to resolve the election outcome; and (3) granting a “general amnesty.”

Below we describe our concerns regarding these specific proposals, on the basis of international human rights law and our decades-long experience in Venezuela.

A repeat election?

The government of Brazil has suggested that a possible solution to the crisis in Venezuela would entail repeating the election.[8] Similarly, President Petro has suggested that there should be “new free elections.”[9]

As your excellencies understand well, a basic premise of any election is that it should reflect the expressed will of the people and result in the peaceful transfer of power to the prevailing candidate or candidates in accordance with prearranged formulas.

Repeating the election because the Maduro government is not willing to disclose and accept the result of the July 28 elections would make a mockery of these principles. Such a proposal would be unacceptable in any country. It would be particularly problematic in Venezuela given the significant barriers voters and candidates were forced to overcome in order to participate in the July 28 elections, including widespread human rights violations, that made the playing field markedly uneven and put many voters and candidates at risk of government abuse.[10]

Additionally, since the election, the Maduro government has taken steps to make the playing field even more uneven, by arresting members of the opposition, threatening to imprison González and the opposition leader María Corina Machado, passing a law that grants the government broad power to shut down NGOs, and proposing laws to further restrict international electoral observation.[11]

While we reject the idea of repeating the election, we agree with your governments that a solution to the crisis in Venezuela should include guarantees for all political parties to take part in public affairs. Like elsewhere, that would require ensuring the participation of people with diverse political views, including those allied to Maduro, in different institutions within the Venezuelan state, including in the National Assembly and in governor’s offices. It would also require the end of arbitrary prosecution of opposition leaders and other critics, and the release of all people who remain arbitrarily detained. We urge your excellencies to continue focusing your efforts on these initiatives and in ensuring respect for the will of the people as reflected in the July 28 election.

Relying on Venezuela’s Supreme Court to Resolve the Election Outcome?

Your governments have stated that “disputes about the electoral process must be settled through institutional channels.”[12] The government of Mexico has said that it is “awaiting the decision of the Supreme Court’s Electoral Chamber” with regards to the election.[13] President López Obrador interrupted his participation in your governments’ dialogues on Venezuela pending a Supreme Court decision on the tally sheets and results.[14]

As your excellencies are aware, on August 22 the Supreme Court “categorically validated” the electoral results announced by the CNE and called on electoral authorities to “publish the final results.”[15] The court also said that the tally sheets made public by the opposition were “allegedly fake or forged” and urged authorities to investigate the “fear” that these had caused in the population.[16]

In a welcomed statement after the ruling, President López Obrador said that his government would “wait until the tally sheets are made public” before recognizing a winner in the election. He said that while the “Supreme Court says that President Maduro won the election, it also recommends publishing the results.”[17] Likewise, Presidents Petro and Lula da Silva, “took note of the decision” and said that “they are still awaiting the release, by the National Electoral Council, of the tally sheets broken down by polling station.”[18]

Several Venezuelan legal experts had questioned whether the Supreme Court’s Electoral Chamber had the legal mandate to resolve this case.[19] More importantly, a wide range of international authorities, including the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights, agree the court lacks independence from the government.[20]

The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Karim Khan, on the basis of his office’s preliminary examination, has identified several factors “affecting the independence and impartiality” of Supreme Court judges in Venezuela, including that most of them are “reported to have connections with the current political party in power,” that some were appointed in violation of Venezuelan law and that there are credible allegations that judges are appointed “because of their perceived loyalty to the government.”[21]

Similarly, the United Nations’ Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Venezuela has documented credible allegations that the Supreme Court justices “routinely receive orders with respect to how to decide judgments” from the executive branch.[22]

Instead of protecting Venezuelans’ right to participate in free and fair elections, the Court has played a leading role in undermining the 2024 electoral process. In January 2024, the Court upheld a decision to bar Machado, as well as Henrique Capriles, from running for office.[23] The Court has also repeatedly appointed government supporters to leadership positions in opposition parties, including Acción Democrática, Primero Justicia and, more recently, the Venezuelan Communist Party, undermining the parties’ autonomy.[24]

Additionally, following the announced electoral results, the Supreme Court congratulated Nicolás Maduro for his “re-election,” saying that the electoral process was “peaceful, transparent, effective, auditable and an example for the world.”[25]

Given this context, the Supreme Court’s final decision is not a credible analysis of the electoral results or Venezuelan law that will inspire widespread trust or acceptance. We therefore urge your governments to insist on an independent verification of the results, which should be conducted by a credible and impartial third party.

A “general amnesty”?

President Gustavo Petro has suggested that there should be a “general amnesty” of “national and international” reach in Venezuela.[26]

As your excellencies are aware, under international law, governments have an obligation to investigate and prosecute serious human rights violations and international crimes.[27] The United Nations Fact Finding Mission on Venezuela—as well as human rights organizations in Venezuela and abroad—have repeatedly documented serious human rights violations in the country. The Mission has identified reasons to believe that members of the Maduro government have committed crimes against humanity, including extrajudicial executions, politically motivated detentions and torture.[28] Separately, the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC has been conducting, since 2021, an investigation into crimes against humanity in the country.

Respecting these obligations under international human rights law will likely require strategic criminal investigations that prioritize those most responsible for atrocities and focus on the worst and most notorious crimes.

Alongside the obligation to investigate and prosecute serious abuses, other transitional justice mechanisms may be necessary to remedy harms, restore the rule-of-law and ensure non-recurrence following conflict or crisis. Such efforts may entail legal reforms, and vigorous mechanisms to ensure truth telling and restorative and reparative justice.

As the recent experience in Colombia shows, non-blanket conditional amnesties may also have a role to play.[29] However, President Petro’s broadly phrased proposal appears to violate international law, in ways that would affect the rights of victims of atrocities. Equally, such proposal would fail to ensure legal certainty for all stakeholders in Venezuela, as amnesties in violation of international law could easily be abrogated or disregarded by national, foreign or international jurisdictions in the future.

We hope you take these recommendations into consideration as you pursue your valuable efforts to find a solution to the crisis in Venezuela. I remain at your disposal to discuss this matter further or share additional information regarding the situation in Venezuela.

Gulzipa Dzhaukerova was a schoolteacher before she got involved in civic activism. She told Human Rights Watch that, even as a teacher, she got in trouble with school administrators because she spoke openly to her students about authoritarianism in Kazakhstan. Eventually the school asked her to leave. Dzhaukerova took up various jobs, including selling goods at the bazaar and trying to run a small business, after she left teaching.

Dzhaukerova was prosecuted twice on “extremism”-related charges in recent years, sentenced on each occasion, in 2019 and again in 2021, to a one-year non-custodial “restricted-freedom” sentence. Both times she was banned from engaging in political activities for two and three years, respectively. Her participation in peaceful protests was treated as evidence of involvement in political opposition groups that a court deemed “extremist” and banned, even though the groups have never carried out, nor advocated, violence.

Although Dzhaukerova was not found guilty of financing or committing any acts of violence or terrorism, because she was convicted on an extremism-related charge, she was automatically added to Kazakhstan’s “list of organizations and people associated with financing terrorism and extremism” (“Financing Terrorism List”). People on the list are subject to “targeted financial sanctions related to the prevention of terrorism and the financing of terrorism” under article 12 of Kazakhstan’s 2009 money laundering law (officially, the law “On combating the legalization (laundering) of proceeds from crime and the financing of terrorism”).

In practice, this has meant she is subject to significant financial restrictions, including being blocked from accessing her bank accounts or using credit or debit cards, or conducting certain financial transactions at the post office or notary. Dzhaukerova told Human Rights Watch that, because of the impact the restrictions have had, she has had limited ability to buy basic staples for her family, and at times has rationed portions of food to ensure her 14-year-old son has enough to eat.

Dzhaukerova is not alone. At time of writing, the Financing Terrorism List included just over 1,400 people, nearly half of whom, like Dzhaukerova, were convicted of “extremist” or “terrorist” offences under Kazakhstan’s criminal code that are extremely problematic as they are overly broad, used to criminalize legitimate exercise of freedom of speech and expression protected by international law, and do not actually involve committing or advocating any acts of violence, far less financing terrorism. All convicted of these dubious offences face state-imposed financial restrictions.

The Kazakhstan government has a duty to protect citizens against violence; criminal laws to prevent terrorism, violent extremism, and the financing of terrorism, which are appropriately drafted with precision to target specific criminal activity and not open to misuse, can be legitimate measures in fulfilling this duty. At present, however, relevant Kazakh laws do not distinguish between violent and non-violent “extremism.”

Independent experts and bodies, including the United Nations special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism, have raised serious concerns about the provisions in Kazakhstan’s criminal code relating to extremism and terrorism that are vaguely worded and overbroad, and which are used to criminalize activities and speech, such as peaceful protests against government policies, which are protected under international human rights law.

The serious harm of politically motivated convictions under such broad laws, which has been well-documented by local and international rights groups, and by international human rights bodies, is compounded by the fact that affected individuals are additionally and automatically added to the Financing Terrorism List, meaning they are subject to the financial restrictions laid out in Kazakhstan’s 2009 money laundering law. These financial restrictions—when applied to people who have not engaged in, instigated, or financed violence—are unjustified and inappropriate. Not only are there potential serious procedural issues given the manner in which they are imposed, the financial restrictions have also led to violations of economic and social rights guaranteed under international human rights law, including the rights to an adequate standard of living and access to work and social security. This report documents and brings to light abuses stemming from inclusion on the Financing Terrorism List.

Kazakhstan should exclude crimes qualified as “extremist” from automatic inclusion on the Financing Terrorism List, and immediately lift financial restrictions on anyone currently on the list who was convicted of non-violent “extremist” or “terrorism” crimes. They should revise the provisions in the criminal code on extremism and terrorism so that they are drafted with sufficient precision to guarantee legal certainty and not to capture legitimate exercise of freedoms of speech, expression, and association, or violate other rights protected by international law.

Kazakhstan’s international partners should urge the government to end its crackdown on government critics and others on overbroad extremism-related charges and ensure that legislation pertaining to terrorism or extremism complies with international human rights law.





Recommendations

The Government of Kazakhstan should:

Bring extremism and terrorism-related laws into full compliance with Kazakhstan’s international obligations by, among other things, revising the definition of “extremism” in national legislation.

Implement the recommendations of the United Nations special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism following her visit to Kazakhstan in 2019.

Review how individuals are designated for inclusion on the Financing Terrorism List with a view to ending the automatic inclusion of people convicted on “extremism” or “terrorism”-related charges for actions or speech that did not incite or involve violence and ensuring full due process in the process of identifying those to be put on the list to prevent other arbitrary and unjustified inclusion.

Ensure that financial restrictions tied to the financing or committing of terrorism do not extend to lawful financial transactions, such as, but not limited to paying public transportation costs, having full access to wages earned, and buying life or car insurance.

Review how individuals on the Financing Terrorism List are flagged in electronic systems in Kazakhstan, so they are not penalized due to their personal identification numbers being blocked.

Allow free speech and criticism of the authorities without fear of retribution.

Allow political opposition groups to carry out peaceful activities in Kazakhstan and to register their parties without fear of retribution, in accordance with Kazakhstan’s international obligations.

Commission an independent review of all convictions on “extremist” criminal charges and ask the courts to vacate all convictions imposed on people simply for alleged membership in or support of a peaceful political opposition group.

Kazakhstan’s international partners should:

Call on the government of Kazakhstan to revise the definition of “extremism” in national legislation so it complies with Kazakhstan’s international obligations and implement the recommendations of the United Nations special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism.

Call on the government to commission an independent review of all convictions on extremist-designated criminal charges and to stop targeting perceived or actual members of peaceful political opposition groups banned as “extremist.”

Press Kazakhstan’s authorities to immediately release from prison, pre-trial detention, or house arrest, and lift probation sentence and conditions, and other restrictions on all those prosecuted for the peaceful expression of critical views.

Review policies, bilateral cooperation, and the provision of financial resources or material support for Kazakhstan government initiatives to counter violent terrorism to ensure they are not de facto complicit in violations of fundamental human rights.

Within the framework of bilateral trade and cooperation agreements and human rights dialogues, ensure that Kazakhstan is held to its international obligations to put human rights at the core of counterterrorism strategies.

The Financial Action Task Force member states and leadership should:

Ensure that Kazakhstan fully complies with Recommendation 6 to ensure that no one is wrongfully subjected to targeted financial sanctions for non-violent actions or speech protected under international human rights law.

Closely monitor Kazakhstan’s anti-terrorism conduct and consider lowering its FATF compliance status if abuses persist.





Methodology

Human Rights Watch conducted research for this report in late February and early March 2024 in two cities in Kazakhstan, Astana and Almaty. Additional interviews were conducted remotely in April 2024 with people in Astana, Atyrau, Uralsk, and Kyzylorda. Researchers interviewed 18 people, 15 of whom had been prosecuted on extremism- or terrorism-related charges, and three others whose adult children were prosecuted on such charges. Human Rights Watch also interviewed two human rights lawyers in Almaty and reviewed relevant court documents and media articles pertaining to several of the cases mentioned in this report.

In April, Human Rights Watch sent a written summary of our findings to the Foreign Affairs Ministry requesting a government response. On June 3, Human Rights Watch received a written response. Information provided in that letter is reflected in the report below.

Interviews were conducted in Russian by Human Rights Watch researchers fluent in Russian and English. Human Rights Watch informed all interviewees of the purpose and voluntary nature of the interview. Participants gave oral informed consent to participate in interviews and agreed to the use of their names. They received no compensation for speaking to Human Rights Watch.





Ongoing Crackdown on Government Critics

The Kazakhstan government has long restricted the rights to peaceful assembly, expression, and association, including by using vague and overbroad criminal charges relating to “terrorism” and “extremism” to harass and prosecute political opposition activists and other independent government critics. Authorities have also targeted peaceful religious persons using these overbroad, vague “terrorism” and “extremism”-related charges.

In March 2018, an Astana court ruled that the Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan (DVK), a political opposition group, was an “extremist” organization and banned its activities throughout Kazakhstan, including online and on social media networks. In May 2020, some months after activists announced the formation of a new group, the Koshe Party, it was also banned by court order as “extremist,” with authorities contending that it was the same as DVK under another name. The decisions to ban the groups were based on state-commissioned psychological-linguistic analyses of the groups’ material posted on social media. The court rulings did not cite any other evidence showing that either group had advocated or engaged in violence.

Since 2018, authorities across Kazakhstan have ramped up efforts to suppress political opposition activism. In July 2021, Human Rights Watch documented how authorities had increased their misuse of “extremism” charges to harass and prosecute government critics. The report documented how police targeted at least 135 people across the country with criminal investigations and prosecutions for alleged participation in banned “extremist” political opposition groups for nothing more than the peaceful expression of their critical views.

Police continue to routinely break up peaceful protests and subject activists to preventative detentions in advance of publicly announced rallies. Outspoken government critics engaged in peaceful activism continue to face regular police harassment, including unfounded arrest and criminal charges for alleged membership in so-called banned “extremist” organizations.

In November 2023, the opposition leader Marat Zhylanbaev was sentenced to seven years in prison on charges of “financing extremist activities” and “membership in a banned extremist organization.” His sentence was upheld on appeal. On August 2, a Kazakh court sentenced Duman Mukhammedkarim, an independent journalist and activist, held in pretrial detention since June 2023, to seven years in prison on charges of “financing extremist activities” and “participating in the activities of a banned extremist organization.” On August 16, 2024, another civic activist, Asylbek Zhamuratov, was sentenced to seven years in prison on the same charges.

Activists have been trying unsuccessfully for over two years to register the “Alga, Kazakhstan!” opposition party, with Kazakhstan’s Justice Ministry rejecting their application two dozen times as of this writing.





Countering “Extremism” in Kazakhstan

Human Rights Watch and other rights groups and experts have documented how the vague and overbroad definitions of “extremism” and “terrorism” in Kazakhstan laws and their broad applicability to non-violent acts allow for undue restrictions on and violations of fundamental human rights, including freedoms of religion, expression, assembly, and association. The former United Nations special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, Fionnuala Ní Aoláin, noted in her 2019 report on Kazakhstan that “the term “extremism” has no purchase in binding international legal standards and, when employed as a criminal legal category, is irreconcilable with the principle of legal certainty and is per se incompatible with the exercise of certain fundamental human rights.”

In the years since Ní Aoláin’s visit to Kazakhstan, authorities have not taken any steps to narrow the definition of “extremism” per Ní Aoláin’s recommendations, but rather broadened the definition of terrorist activities and increased powers of the National Security Committee and Internal Affairs bodies, including during times of “mass disorder.” When asked what steps the government has taken to implement Ní Aoláin’s recommendations, the Foreign Affairs Ministry stated only that article 174 of the criminal code (“inciting discord”) had been amended to include a fine, in addition to restricted freedom and prison sentences.

Kazakhstan’s Criminal Code contains 15 offenses that are qualified as “terrorist” offenses, and 12 that are qualified as “extremist” offenses. Anyone convicted of either type of offense and whose verdict has entered into force is automatically put on the Financing Terrorism List regardless of whether they committed or incited any violence, or financed any terrorist or violent extremist activities. Additionally, the Prosecutor General’s Office can identify “individuals involved in terrorist and extremist activities” for inclusion in the list. This process is done without the Prosecutor General’s Office having to present verifiable evidence of the basis for their designation of the person as involved in terrorist or extremist activities to a judge or independent judicial body. This leaves the process open to abuse and creates real risk that individuals can be arbitrarily identified for inclusion on the list.

Within 24 hours of being put on the Financing Terrorism List, “subjects of financial monitoring,” which refers to entities that conduct financial transactions, such as banks, notaries, and post offices, are required by the government to freeze transactions relating to the individual’s finances or property, including by blocking their access to bank accounts, preventing insurance payments, and “refusing to carry out other transactions with money and (or) other property.”

What this means in practice is that individuals on the list are blocked from accessing their bank accounts or using their credit cards for making purchases or conducting certain financial transactions at the post office or with a notary. Being on the list interferes with their ability to get a job, and if they have a job already, by law, they cannot withdraw more than the equivalent of the minimum wage, an amount set annually by the government, and only if they are granted permission by the authorities to do so.

“I consider it an economic blockade,” said Abaibek Sultanov, who was prosecuted in May 2021 on extremism-related charges because of his civic activism. Darkhan Valiev, another civic activist prosecuted twice in recent years on similar charges, and who is now on the Financing Terrorism List, described it as “being left completely without means of survival.”

While it is possible that some of the 1,433 people (number current as of March 31, 2024) on the state’s Financing Terrorism List committed or instigated violent acts, the people Human Rights Watch interviewed for this report were prosecuted on “extremism” or “terrorism” charges for peaceful political or religious activities or speech under articles 405 – “organizing or participating in the activities of a public or religious association or other organization after a court decision banning their activities or liquidating them in connection with extremism or terrorism;” 174 – “inciting social, ethnic, tribal, racial, class or religious discord;” and 256 – “terrorism propaganda or public calls to committing an act of terrorism.” In the case of several of the people interviewed for this report, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in October 2021 issued a decision finding that their detention was illegal and recommending their immediate release.

According to data provided by the Foreign Affairs Ministry, of the 1,433 people on the Financing Terrorism List as of March 31, 2024, 141 individuals were convicted under article 405; 205 individuals were convicted under article 174; and 317 individuals were convicted under article 256 of Kazakhstan’s Criminal Code. That represents nearly half of the individuals on the Financing Terrorism List as of March 31, 2024.

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global terrorism financing and money laundering watchdog, says “countries should implement targeted financial sanctions regimes to comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions relating to the prevention and suppression of terrorism and terrorist financing.” FATF is a body made up of 40 UN member states that advances its work through a set of 40 recommendations comprising an international standard. Kazakhstan is a member of the Eurasian Group, a FATF-style regional body, which became an associate member of the FATF in June 2010.

Notably, none of FATF’s 40 recommendations – meant to guide national authorities’ implementation of efforts to prevent and suppress terrorism and terrorist financing through “legal, regulatory and operational measures” – includes mention of “extremism” or extremism-related crimes.

However FATF recommendations in the past have facilitated government misuse of measures nominally introduced to comply with obligations to prevent and suppress terrorism and terrorist financing, to clamp down on civil society and its ability to function. This has long been raised with FATF by various actors including United Nations experts, and while revision of some of the more problematic recommendations has taken place government misuse of anti-terrorism and anti-money laundering provisions to silence critics continues.

The crime of “extremism” in Kazakhstan legislation violates the principle of legal certainty, which is integral to the rule of law and human rights norms, and requires criminal offences be defined with sufficient precision and clarity so that people can foresee what exact behaviors are prohibited. Several offenses currently qualified as “extremist” in Kazakhstan law are so vague and broad as to criminalize actions or speech protected under international human rights law.





Lack of Information about the List

Kazakhstan’s 2009 money laundering law lays out how an individual is identified for inclusion on the Financing Terrorism List and the financial sanctions which follow from inclusion on the list. Article 12 stipulates that an “authorized body” compiles a list of organizations and individuals associated with financing terrorism and/or extremism, publishes the list on its website, and sends it to relevant government bodies in electronic form. The “authorized body” is the Financial Monitoring Agency, a government body leading Kazakhstan’s efforts to combat “the legalization of proceeds from crime and the financing of terrorism.” The agency reports directly to the president. The list includes the full names of individuals, their date of birth and personal identification numbers, as well as the names of organizations.

Although article 12 of the 2009 money laundering law also provides the basis for including those convicted of non-violent extremism offences on the list, inclusion on the list is not actually part of the sanction or sentence handed down by the court at time of conviction.

Several people expressed frustration that the verdicts in their respective criminal cases did not indicate they would be subject to financial restrictions. “Even at court, they said nothing about this,” Aigul Utepova, a journalist from Astana prosecuted on “extremist” charges in 2021, told Human Rights Watch. “I asked at trial, and they said that everything would be written in the verdict. But there is nothing.” Darkhan Valiev, the activist prosecuted twice in recent years and still on the Financing Terrorism List, said, “There is nothing about these restrictions in the verdict. And [the authorities] don’t explain either.”

The majority of people interviewed for this report described the financial restrictions they face in terms of their personal IDs being blocked. While Kazakhstan’s 2009 money laundering law does not specify the way banks and other entities are required to block financial transactions by people on the Financing Terrorism List, it appears the Kazakhstan government flags their personal identification numbers (IINs) in centralized electronic systems to which all citizen services in Kazakhstan are tied. Kazakhstan’s Foreign Affairs Ministry confirmed that authorities apply “freezing measures…to a person included in the List on the basis of his identity data.”

Yevgeniy Zhovtis, director of the human rights organization Kazakhstan International Bureau of Human Rights and Rule of Law, explained to Human Rights Watch: “In any institution that provides public services or services using public funds, everything is reflected and recorded through one’s personal identification number. Because their ID numbers are blocked, they’re blocked in all systems.”

Sixteen of the 18 people interviewed by Human Rights Watch for this report did not know precisely how long they or their loved one would remain on the list, the extent of the restrictions to which they or their loved one are subjected, or how and when they or their loved one would be removed from the list. Kazakhstan authorities had not provided them with this information. The remaining two are no longer subject to financial restrictions.

With the exception of one person whom the authorities proactively informed was on the list, all others found out their finances would be or had been blocked from others who had been earlier prosecuted on the same criminal charges and who similarly had their finances blocked or found out when they tried unsuccessfully to carry out a financial transaction, such as using a bank card.

In its correspondence with Human Rights Watch, the Foreign Affairs Ministry did not specify which government agency is responsible for informing individuals they have been added to the list. However, it did clarify that an individual who has served his sentence, but whose criminal record has not expired, can request to be excluded from the list by applying to “the law enforcement or special state body (Prosecutor General's Office, NSC, Ministry of Internal Affairs) that conducted the criminal investigation [in the individual’s case].” One of the people interviewed for this report had successfully petitioned the authorities to be removed from the Financing Terrorism List by the time of publication.

Several people told Human Rights Watch that they sought more information from the AFM after learning their access to various accounts had been blocked, or after they realized they could no longer use their bank cards, to no avail.

Abay Begimbetov, an activist who was sentenced in October 2021 to five years in prison for membership in the banned opposition group Koshe Party, told Human Rights Watch that after his release, he and several others who faced financial restrictions went in person to the Financial Monitoring Agency office in Almaty, but were turned away. “We went directly there, as soon as these problems started after we were released. But they didn’t give a clear answer. They said go check at court, go to the police station, even though the block didn’t come from them.”

Abaibek Sultanov, an activist who in May 2021 was similarly convicted for membership in the banned Koshe Party, told Human Rights Watch that when he went to the local office of the Financial Monitoring Agency, they directed him elsewhere. “The AFM sent me to court; the court sent me to the bailiff; the bailiff said we don’t know anything, then I went to the prosecutor. …The district prosecutor replied that he doesn’t know what the list is supposedly.”

The lack of information provided to individuals about being placed on the list, and what that means in terms of financial restrictions, including lack of information about the duration and extent of the restrictions and how they are lifted, puts an unnecessary and unjustified burden on those individuals, and casts doubt on the legality of the process.

When inclusion on the list is the consequence of a criminal conviction this element of the sanction should also be set out in the verdict. Authorities responsible for imposing and monitoring the restrictions should also promptly provide any individual placed on the list with all the necessary information about why they have been placed on the list, the type and scope of restrictions they face, for how long exactly they will be subject to restrictions, and how they can appeal to be removed.

Human Rights Watch asked the Foreign Affairs Ministry to clarify if there is any judicial oversight with respect to an individual being placed on the list, removed from the list, or monitoring of their compliance with the financial restrictions. The ministry did not directly answer the question, but instead quoted from article 12, subsection 5 of the 2009 money laundering law, which specifies the grounds that a person can be excluded from the list.





Violations of Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights

The inclusion of people on Kazakhstan’s Financing Terrorism List and the financial restrictions to which they are subsequently subjected leads to violations of rights guaranteed by the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) to which Kazakhstan is a state party.

For example, interviewees described to Human Rights Watch the significant barriers they faced trying to secure formal employment. They also described challenges to accessing social security and other benefits. Together, these restrictions lead to people being unable to fully enjoy other economic, social, and cultural rights to which they are entitled including, but not limited to, the right to an adequate standard of living.

Access to Work

Interviewees described to Human Rights Watch how being on the Financing Terrorism List created practical barriers to securing formal employment, undermining their right to work and limiting their ability to secure an income in order to provide for themselves and their families.

When asked if he had been able to find work since his release, Bolatbek Nurgaliev, a man prosecuted on religious extremism and propaganda of terrorism charges in 2018, told Human Rights Watch: “With my criminal record, with my IIN [personal identification number] blocked, no one will hire me. Everyone is scared. And how would they pay me anyway?”

Several interviewees told Human Rights Watch that they thought they could earn a living by using their car as a taxi, but were unable to do so because the restrictions meant they were unable to purchase or renew their car insurance. “When I ran out of savings, I asked my father if I could borrow his car so that I could make some money working as a taxi [driver],” the activist Erkin Sabanshiev told Human Rights Watch. “I went [to an insurance company] and they said it’s not allowed.”

Azamat Umbetaliev, who was prosecuted on religious extremism charges in August 2019, tried to get car insurance so he could return to his previous job driving a transport vehicle for people who are blind, but the insurance company refused to sell it to him. Umbetaliev sued the company, but both the courts at first instance and on appeal found in favor of the insurance company. So Umbetaliev took his complaint to the court of cassation, and on August 5, 2023, the court of cassation ruled in his favor, ordering the insurance company to issue car insurance on condition that he apply in person, not online. Seven months later, on March 27, 2024, Umbetaliev finally succeeded in purchasing car insurance.

Other interviewees told Human Rights Watch the only way they have been able to survive without employment is with the help of immediate relatives.

Aigul Utepova, who previously worked as a journalist in Astana, said she relied wholly on her daughter. “If I was on my own, how could I have lived without a bank account, without work? It’s just a miracle that I have a daughter and she helped and continues to help me.” The activist Erkin Sabanshiev expressed a similar sentiment. “I’m blessed that I have parents. If not for them, I would have starved, or I would have started thieving, because really everything is blocked.”

Gulzipa Dzhaukerova told Human Rights Watch she works intermittently at the bazaar on weekends to make some money, but does not know how she has survived the five years since her prosecution. “I’m under an economic blockade. … I can’t open up any accounts, even virtual cards, I’m blocked. Even when friends want to help, send money virtually, they can’t. We have to meet in person [so they can give me cash].”

Article 12, subsection 8, of the 2009 money laundering law provides that, in cases when an individual on the list is employed, he or she is permitted to receive from his total pay the equivalent of one count of the minimum wage, as set that year, for himself and one count for each of his dependents. However, the process to apply for permission to withdraw partial wages is onerous. The individual must provide their bank with a certificate from their place of work confirming employment and their total wages. If the individual is requesting additional wages to support dependents, they must also provide their dependents’ identification documents, a birth certificate and/or a marriage certificate and proof of unemployment for their spouse. Then the bank is permitted to disperse funds only with the approval of the AFM, which also determines “the procedure for paying funds to an individual in the list.”

The Kazakhstan International Bureau of Human Rights and Rule of Law, a nongovernmental organization based in Almaty, Kazakhstan’s largest city, concluded in a 2018 report analyzing the Financing Terrorism List’s compliance with international human rights law that “the procedure for receiving wages … is unnecessarily complicated and unjustified.”

While Kazakhstan’s establishment and implementation of the Financing Terrorism List is inspired by UN Security Council resolutions, the system Kazakhstan has put in place and in particular its use against persons who have not financed or are not credibly suspected of financing terrorism nor engaged in or advocated violence, goes well beyond what any UN Security Council resolution requires of states. In particular, the withholding of wages earned in the manner that the system does, is an unjustified interference in the individual’s personal and family life with serious consequences for their right to enjoy their social and economic rights under human rights law.

In her report following her 2019 country visit to Kazakhstan, the United Nations special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism noted “her extreme disquiet at the hardship created for family members and dependents given the impact of inclusion [on the Financing Terrorism List] (asset freezing, prohibition of engaging in a number of commercial and notarial acts) and the breadth of this listing capacity, resulting in independently undermining the rights of women and children under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.” She stressed that “Security Council resolutions on counter-terrorism, including those relating to sanctions, are not a carte blanche for the denial of human rights.”

The unjustified restrictions on the receipt of wages in full is aggravated by the fact that Kazakhstan’s minimum wage, currently equivalent to US$190 a month, does not amount to a ‘living wage,’ an amount that would allow people to enjoy their rights to “social security, healthcare, education and an adequate standard of living, including food, water, sanitation, housing, clothing, and additional expenses such as commuting costs.” When asked if the Kazakhstan government considers 85,000 Tenge, or US$190 a month, sufficient to cover an individual’s basic needs, the Foreign Affairs Ministry responded only by saying “the question is incorrectly worded.” However, recent living wage estimates for Kazakhstan, as estimated by the Wage Indicator Foundation, are 182,860 Tenge (US$412) a month for Almaty and 178,846 Tenge (US$403) for Astana, amounts that are over double Kazakhstan’s current minimum wage. According to Numbeo, an online cost of living database, the monthly cost of living for a single person in Almaty is currently about US$600/month.

Interference with the Access to Social Security, Benefits, and Entitlements

Similar to the situation for wages above, under article 12, subsection 8 of the 2009 money laundering law, in order for individuals on the list to receive “pension[s]” or “other social payments,” they have to request permission. Several people on the list described to Human Rights Watch how being on the list, and in particular the resulting blocking of personal ID numbers, serves as a barrier to receipt of social security and other benefits.

Samat Adilov told Human Rights Watch that although he was able to receive disability benefits while in state custody serving his five-and-a-half-year prison sentence on religious extremism charges, he has not had access to those funds since his release. “I have a disability because of my eye,” Adilov told Human Rights Watch, “But I can’t access my disability benefit. I went to state offices, wrote claims, but without result.”

Darkhan Valiev, an activist who in recent years has been prosecuted twice on extremism-related charges and who spent nine months in pretrial detention, told Human Rights Watch that he is entitled to veteran payments after serving in the war in Tajikistan in the mid-1990s. He explained that he can withdraw his monthly veteran benefit because of a special banking account he opened for such purposes prior to his conviction, but that he is unable to access an additional annual benefit issued every year on Army Day in May: “I go to the post office, give them my identification number, they open up their system, see the account, see the money, but they can’t release it. … Since I was released [from pretrial detention], [this money] is stuck in the post office. They can’t access it for me.”

Akmaral Kerimbaeva, who was sentenced to one-year restricted freedom in October 2019 for alleged membership in the opposition group DVK, told Human Rights Watch she was barred from accessing alimony payments after her conviction. “I went to Narodniy Bank, because that’s where I retrieve alimony payments, but they told me they couldn’t release the funds. They said they couldn’t tell me the reason either. …Later I got a reference letter [spravka] saying that it was because I am on the [Financing Terrorism] List.” Kerimbaeva told Human Rights Watch she sued the bank but was unsuccessful in restoring her access to the alimony payment at that time.

Radio Azattyk, the Kazakh branch of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, has published several articles about the challenges people face due to their inclusion on the Financing Terrorism List, including with respect to accessing financial supports and benefits. In January 2018, Radio Azattyk reported that Olesya Khalabuzar, who was convicted on “inciting discord” charges, could no longer access alimony payments to support her children because her bank accounts were blocked after she was included on the list. In November 2018, the journalist Saniya Toiken reported that an Aktau resident who was imprisoned on terrorism-related charges, after her release, could not apply for maternity benefits because of the restrictions.

Two interviewees told Human Rights Watch that they were able to access social payments, but that it was a hassle to do so each month. Serik Shakhin, who has been tried twice in recent years under article 405 of the criminal code for alleged membership in a banned extremist group, told Human Rights Watch that he cannot freely access his pension because his bank accounts are blocked. “In the end, I opened an account at the post office…but it’s normally blocked, so [each month] I must write a [request to withdraw funds] and they send it off to the head office to approve it. It might take them two hours, or I have to come back the next day. After that they give permission for me to withdraw my pension.”

Arbitrary Limits on Lawful Financial Transactions

In addition to the restrictions described above, Kazakhstan’s 2009 money laundering law bars persons on the Financing Terrorism List from buying or selling property, using a notary, exchanging money, and carrying out certain financial transactions at the post office. Such restrictions—on lawful financial transactions, not tied to the financing or commission of terrorism—are arbitrary. In its correspondence with Human Rights Watch, the Foreign Affairs Ministry did not explain the grounds on which persons on the Financing Terrorism List are prevented from making lawful financial transactions, except to quote provisions directly from the money laundering law.

All of the people interviewed by Human Rights Watch for this report described how these various restrictions interfered with their ability to conduct legal affairs or provide for themselves and their families.

Samat Adilov, who was tried on religious extremism charges in 2018, has a house in Kostanai, a town in northern Kazakhstan, registered in his name. He told Human Rights Watch that he wanted to transfer ownership of the house to his nephew and his wife, who live in Kostanai, but was barred from doing so. “I can’t use the notary. I can’t write a power-of-attorney. I can’t buy anything. I can’t sell anything,” he explained.

Serik Shakhin, an activist who has been twice prosecuted for membership in a banned “extremist” organization in recent years, is similarly stuck with property he and his wife would like to sell. “My spouse doesn’t have the right to sell anything [we co-own] without my permission, but I can’t give it to her because it’s prohibited [for me],” Shakhin said.

Abaibek Sultanov told Human Rights Watch that his family was looking to dispose of their property outside Almaty, but that his family could not finish the registration process, a necessary prerequisite, because of the financial restrictions he is under. “We went to the public service center (TsON) to register the house,” Sultanov told Human Rights Watch. “But they gave us a notice that we are not permitted because someone [in the family] is ‘financing extremism.’” A court in Kazakhstan convicted Sultanov on charges of membership in a banned extremist organization (art. 405) in response to his peaceful opposition activities, not for financing or committing terrorism.

People on the list are also barred from exchanging money, even in small amounts. “I went to an exchange office – I wanted to exchange 100 dollars,” Dametkan Aspandiyarova, a civic activist in Almaty who was sentenced to two years’ restricted freedom in October 2021, told Human Rights Watch: “They asked for my ID, and then they told me no, you’re not allowed. You’re on a red list, they said.”

The Atyrau-based activist, Maks Bokaev, who was wrongfully sentenced to five years in prison on charges of “inciting social discord” after participating in protests against proposed amendments to the Land Code in 2016, told Human Rights Watch that he tried to buy a life insurance policy after his release from prison in 2021, but insurance companies refused to sell him one. He also described how he was barred from paying his bus fare through his mobile phone, because of the financial restrictions in place following his conviction. “At first I thought there was something wrong with the account, but it happened again, so I went in [to ask],” Bokaev explained. The mobile phone company confirmed in an email to Bokaev that “mobile financial services are indeed blocked on your number.”





Lack of Legal Remedy

Despite the multiple ways in which placing people who have been prosecuted for non-violent “extremist” offenses on the Financing Terrorism List leads to violations of internationally protected human rights, courts in Kazakhstan have mostly declined to consider complaints brought before them or ruled against the complainants.

In 2018, Vladimir Kozlov, Ablaikhan Chalimbaev, Serik Borambaev, and Turarbek Kusainov, opposition figures who had been tried on extremism- or terrorism-related criminal charges between 2010 and 2014, filed a complaint against Kazakhstan’s ministries of finance, justice, foreign affairs, and internal affairs, the Prosecutor General's Office, and the National Security Committee, before the Yesilskiy District Court challenging the legality of the provisions allowing for inclusion of their names on the Financing Terrorism List.

They argued that although they were convicted of crimes that the Criminal Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan classifies as “terrorist” and “extremist,” their convictions “did not directly establish their involvement in the financing of terrorist and extremist activities” and requested their names be removed from the list.

The Yesilskiy District Court in Astana issued a decision on June 3, 2018, refusing to consider the complaint on jurisdictional grounds, saying that it was not a matter subject to civil proceedings. The men’s lawyer, Inara Masanova, told Human Rights Watch that the court should have indicated in its ruling what alternative legal avenue or avenues – under criminal or administrative procedures, for example - was open to the men for consideration of their complaint, but that the court did not specify this in its ruling. The group appealed, but the court’s decision was upheld, including by the Supreme Court of Kazakhstan without, at any stage, the courts explaining what legal route was open to the men to challenge the legality of their inclusion on the list.

Burkutbay Nasyrkhanov, a former miner and activist from Satpaev, a town in central Kazakhstan, was prosecuted in June 2021 on charges of membership in a banned extremist organization and sentenced to one and a half years of restricted freedom and a three-year ban on participating in civic or political activities. Following his conviction, he was automatically added to the list of people and organizations associated with financing terrorism and extremism, and his finances were blocked.

In response, he sued the Narodniy Bank of Kazakhstan, asking the court to find the bank’s restrictions on his accounts illegal and cancel them. He argued that he was “not charged with financing terrorism or extremism [and] believes that the provisions of article 12 of the [2009 money laundering law], which impose restrictions on persons included in the List, contradict Kazakhstan’s international obligations.”

At the time, Nasyrkhanov told Radio Azattyk, the Kazakhstan branch of Radio Free Liberty/Radio Europe: “My accounts have been blocked, I cannot receive the money I earn, which is accrued by the employer minus all taxes. Why should I limit myself if I earned this money legally? [These] sanctions are imposed on me that were not specified by the court.”

On December 15, 2022, the Zhezkazgan City Court denied Nasyrkhanov’s claim. The court also declined Nasyrkhanov’s and his lawyer’s motion to request an opinion from the Constitutional Court concerning whether articles 12 and 13 of the 2009 money laundering law comply with Kazakhstan’s constitution, because the court “did not see any contradictions or infringements on the rights and freedoms enshrined in the Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan.” In February 2023, the court’s decision was upheld on appeal.





Kazakhstan’s International Obligations

Governments have the obligation to ensure that all counterterrorism measures respect human rights. The UN Global Counterterrorism Strategy, repeatedly reaffirmed by the United Nations General Assembly since 2006, says that member states must make human rights and the rule of law a pillar of their counterterrorism strategies. States must also avoid stifling the rights to freedom of expression, association, peaceful assembly, and freedom of religion or belief in the name of security. Such measures are not only unlawful under international law, they are also counter-productive.

Kazakhstan is party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The vaguely worded criminal law provisions on extremism contravene the principle of legal certainty, integral to human rights norms, which requires that all criminal offences be defined precisely and in an accessible, foreseeable manner. Prosecuting members of non-violent political opposition groups and other individuals who have not engaged in criminal behavior, for their peaceful expressions of opinions that are opposed to the government or for discussions of their religious or political beliefs, violates the rights to freedom of religion, expression, and association, which are guaranteed under the ICCPR in articles 18, 19, and 22, respectively. It may also constitute misuse of the criminal justice system for political purposes.

Placing this category of people on the Financing Terrorism List on dubious legal grounds, and in a manner that is arbitrary and has serious consequences for their well-being and that of their family, also violates their rights to be protected from arbitrary interference with their personal and family lives, and from unlawful attacks on their reputations, under article 17 of the ICCPR.

As noted above, Kazakhstan is also party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR).

Article 6 of the ICESCR protects the right of everyone to work, “which includes the right of everyone to the opportunity to gain his living by work which he freely chooses or accepts.” Article 7 guarantees “the enjoyment of just and favorable conditions of work” and “fair wages and equal remuneration for work of equal value without distinction of any kind.” Article 9 protects the right to social security, which as the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has explained, “encompasses the right to access and maintain benefits, whether in cash or in kind, without discrimination in order to secure protection, inter alia, from (a) lack of work-related income caused by sickness, disability, maternity, employment injury, unemployment, old age, or death of a family member; (b) unaffordable access to health care; (c) insufficient family support, particularly for children and adult dependents.” Article 11 requires states to ensure the right of everyone to “an adequate standard of living for himself and his family, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and to the continuous improvement of living conditions.”

The sanction of being placed on the Financing Terrorism List results in far reaching interferences with all of these rights. Given the dubious legality of the basis on which individuals are placed on the list and the lack of due process guarantees, including access to a remedy for those on the list, the sanction, at the very least, as it is imposed on those not convicted of violent offences or financing terrorism, violates the ICESR.

(New York) – The Chinese government persists in committing crimes against humanity against Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang while denying repression there, Human Rights Watch said today.

Ahead of the two-year anniversary on August 31, 2022, of the United Nations human rights office’s damning report on Xinjiang, the UN high commissioner for human rights and UN member countries should intensify pressure on the Chinese government to end its abuses.

“Beijing’s brazen refusal to meaningfully address well-documented crimes in Xinjiang is no surprise, but shows the need for a robust follow-up by the UN human rights chief and UN member states,” said Maya Wang, associate China director at Human Rights Watch. “Contrary to the Chinese government’s claims, its punitive campaign against millions of Uyghurs in Xinjiang continues to inflict great pain.”

Over the past two years, the Chinese government has dismissed all calls to end its severe repression in Xinjiang, which includes mass arbitrary detention, torture, enforced disappearances, mass surveillance, cultural and religious persecution, separation of families, forced labor, sexual violence, and violations of reproductive rights.

Hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims remain wrongfully imprisoned. Those abroad have little to no contact with their families in China. Many live with the uncertainty about whether their loved ones – sometimes dozens of their family and relatives – remain detained, imprisoned, or forcibly disappeared. Some families do not know if their relatives who have been taken into custody are even still alive. While a number have been released, they remain subjected to strict police surveillance and further restrictions on their rights.

On August 27, 2024, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, acknowledged that in Xinjiang “many problematic laws and policies remain in place,” and reported that his office continues to press the Chinese authorities to free those being held in arbitrary detention, and clarify the status and whereabouts of those missing.

He expressed hope that, through continued “engagement” with the government, his office could work toward “tangible progress in the protection of human rights for all in China.” He said that his office was “continuing to advocate for implementation” of its recommendations, even though the Chinese delegation has continued to reject all recommendations from the 2022 Xinjiang report. Chinese authorities have dismissed the report as “illegal and void” as recently as during the conclusion of the UN Universal Periodic Review of China’s human rights record in July.

China’s high-profile rejection of the UN Human Rights Office report and recommendations, and repeated pleas from Uyghur victims and families, have not led Türk to issue a comprehensive public update on the situation or on the implementation of the recommendations made in the office’s 2022 report.

“The UN human rights commissioner has recognized that many of the ‘problematic laws and policies’ that led to the abusive crackdown against Uyghurs remain in place,” Wang said. “Two years since the UN Human Rights Office report concluded that abuses in Xinjiang ‘may constitute crimes against humanity,’ the office needs to issue an update on the current situation in Xinjiang and present a concrete action plan for holding those responsible to account.”

UN member states also have a responsibility to follow-up on the report’s grave conclusions, Human Rights Watch said. Since a narrowly defeated attempt to put the situation in Xinjiang on the UN Human Rights Council’s agenda in 2022, UN member states have engaged in little collective action against the crimes being committed against Uyghurs and others.

At the upcoming Human Rights Council session, starting on September 9, countries from all regions should issue a joint statement asking the UN High Commissioner for an update on Xinjiang and concrete recommendations for holding accountable those responsible for serious abuses. Ultimately, they should take long-overdue action to open a China-specific inquiry into the serious abuses throughout the country, as over 50 UN experts and hundreds of rights groups around the world have recommended.

The UN Human Rights Office and governments from around the globe should work together to challenge the Chinese government’s impunity,” Wang said. “The UN Human Rights Commissioner should make clear that no government, however powerful, can get away with such serious international crimes.”",VERY HIGH,20240828T043000Z,Human Rights Watch,"Maya Wang (associate China director at Human Rights Watch), Volker Türk (UN High Commissioner for Human Rights)",Chinese government,"Xinjiang, China",UN member states should issue a joint statement for accountability and inquiry into abuses,Crimes against humanity against Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang,China,Government policies of repression against ethnic minorities
